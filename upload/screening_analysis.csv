Insights from an Integrated LC-MS/MS and Machine Learning Analysis into the Role of Long-Chain CHO-Containing Compounds in Ambient Light-Absorbing Aerosols,"Fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning, and cooking are major emission sources of urban organic aerosols, which have a significant impact on human health and global radiative forcing. This study collected ambient PM2.5 in Shanghai, China, along with particulate matter from biodiesel/diesel-fueled vehicles, bio-oil pyrolysis, and laboratory-scale experiments conducted using a Miniature Combustion Aerosol Standard (lab-MINICAST) experiments. Targeted MS/MS using HPLC-Q-TOF-MS methodology and machine learning were applied to investigate and decode the light-absorbing chromophores of methanol-extracted organic aerosols. The results showed emissions from biomass burning and vehicles are the main contributors to ambient organic aerosols. CHO compounds accounted for the largest proportion. A fraction of the identified light-absorbing chromophores were long-chain CHO-containing compounds, including fatty acids (C18H34O2, C18H32O2, C16H30O2, C5H8O2, and a subset of CnH2nO2 (12 < n < 25)) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs, the remaining CnH2nO2 (12 < n < 25)) originatimg from vehicle emissions, accounting for 65.256% of the organic aerosol light-absorbing during nonbiomass burning days, but only accounting for 7.12% of the CHO compounds and 3.06% of the organic aerosols. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models revealed that all the light-absorbing molecules of the methanol-extracted samples identified in this study typically exhibit higher weights of atomic around oxygen-containing functional groups (>0.5), contrasting with non-light-absorbing substances, which display more uniformly distributed lower atomic weights. This may provide some explanation for the light-absorbing ability of fatty acids and FAMEs. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",,,,
Multifactorial analysis of the relationship between combustion propagation in solid fuels and the BZ burning class number,"Knowledge of the industrial safety of solid fuels is crucial for risk mitigation in conventional and alternative energy generation. This study investigates the relationship between combustion propagation and flame transmission, quantified by the Brennzahl (BZ) Burning Class Number, and physicochemical properties of biomass and coals. The analysis is based on solid fuel characterisation through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), proximate and elemental analysis, and combustion indices. Seven biomass samples (including olive-derived materials, wood, almond shell, wheat straw, cork, and soya) and three coal samples (charcoal, bituminous coal, and anthracite) were analysed. Proximate analysis was conducted experimentally, while ultimate analysis was modelled using a neural network. The results were classified within Van Krevelen diagram ranges. Significant correlations were found between the BZ Number (1–6) and various physicochemical and thermal parameters, notably volatile matter content (particularly for biomass), oxygen percentage, and combustibility index (CI), showing a strong correlation between CI and BZ (R2 > 0.87). Distinctive trends between biomass (BZ 3–5) and coal (BZ 1–3) highlight these parameters' influence on flame and combustion propagation. This multifactorial analysis provides a deeper understanding of the flame propagation governing mechanisms in solid fuels, offering valuable insights for risk assessment and the design of safety measures in industrial environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Unveiling the source contributions of fine and coarse particulate matter using PM-bound metals and PMF-AI modeling,"Particle pollution is a critical global concern with significant implications for public health and the environment. Both fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) particles exhibit diverse compositions and origins, leading to distinct health and environmental consequences. In this study, K-means clustering was employed to differentiate between local, regional, and long-range transport (LRT) sources, showing that LRT significantly increases PM2.5-10 levels, leading to a more than 1.26-fold rise in its annual mean concentration. Using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model, we identified five local and regional source of PM2.5 and four in case of PM2.5-10. Further, AutoML model explains up to 70 % and 71 % of the daily variance in PM2.5 and PM2.5-10, respectively. The complex relationship of these sources was explained using SHapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP). Among the five major factors identified, SHAP analysis reveals that oil combustion (24 %), coal burning (18 %), and non-ferrous metal smelting/biomass burning (17 %) are the predominant contributors to PM2.5. In contrast, ocean spray (28 %) is identified as a significant source of PM2.5-10 pollution followed by oil, non-ferrous metal smelting/biomass burning (20 %) and traffic related emission (14 %). This study offers a novel and comprehensive methodology for identifying the distinct sources of fine and coarse particulate matter. It provides valuable insights that can inform future policies and regulations, particularly in regions facing challenges related to PM pollution. © 2025 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",,,,
The influence of mixed layer depth along the course of incoming air masses to the transport of PM10 components at three rural sampling sites in Spain,"The main objective of this research, was to incorporate Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) estimations across backward air mass trajectories to the broadly used Trajectory Sector Analysis (TSA) and Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) methods, in order to attain a three-dimensional (3D) identification of aerosol transport pathways and to reveal the role of the Mixed Layer (ML) on the transferring of particulates. The developed 3D-TSA and 3D-CWT tools, were combined with daily concentrations of PM10-bound SO42−, NO3−, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and K+ measured at three rural sampling sites in Spain during the years 2019–2020. Vertically extended Saharan dust intrusions from North Africa were associated with air masses travelling both inside and outside the ML and were related to increases of PM10-bound SO42− and Ca2+ at all stations, attributed to the reactions of mineral dust with gaseous precursors of SO42− such as SO2. The advection of sea salt particles, marked by high levels of Na+ and Mg2+, was associated with marine air masses from the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean, moving mainly within the ML. Enhanced levels of PM10 constituents emitted by anthropogenic sources, such as NO3− (traffic and industrial emissions) and K+ (biomass burning), were clearly related to air masses originating from Iberian Peninsula, Central Europe and North African coastline, whilst in most cases the strongest contributions were transferred by air masses moving above the ML. Therefore, the implemented 3D version of TSA and CWT methods, revealed new information regarding the altitudinal characteristics of air masses affecting PM10 levels in Spain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
Concurrent Formation of Low-Maturity EC and BrC in Biomass and Coal Burning: O-PAH as a Precursor,"Black carbon (BC) significantly influences climate change through light absorption. Traditional emission inventories equate BC with elemental carbon (EC) and overlook the variability in its properties across sources, leading to uncertainties in climate predictions. This study shows that EC from solid fuel combustion contains substantial low-maturity EC (char), whose emissions increase alongside the light absorption of soluble organic carbon (OC) as the fuel aromaticity rises. Concurrently, the abundance of oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (O-PAHs) in soluble OC also increases. This suggests that char and brown carbon (BrC) share similar formation pathways with O-PAHs as key precursors. Time-resolved analysis during combustion cycles revealed a significant positive correlation between O-PAHs, the light absorption of soluble OC, and char emissions, further supporting this shared pathway. The nonbonding orbitals in BrC and char facilitate n → π* transitions in the visible region, which are more wavelength-dependent than the π → π* transition in high-maturity EC (soot). This study highlights char as a light-absorbing intermediate, influencing light absorption of EC emitted from solid fuel combustion. These insights into the formation pathways and optical properties of carbonaceous aerosols enhance our understanding of their climate impacts and underscore the need to differentiate between char and soot in climate models to improve accuracy. © 2025 American Chemical Society.",,,,
"An integrated approach for determining the spatial distribution, source apportionment and human health risks of PAHs in soils of rapidly-urbanized areas","The rise of large urban agglomerations has exacerbated pollutant emissions, resulting in regional soil contamination with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which jeopardizes the development of urban agglomerations and affects human health. There is a lack of research in this area in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, with the existing studies on PAHs in soil in the larger region often neglecting the spatial heterogeneity of the pollution sources and systematic analysis of risk assessment. This study introduces the Distribution-Source-Risk framework, analyzed soil PAH pollutants in the region, and examined PAH sources, distribution patterns, and associated health risks. Random forest modeling was employed to map PAH distribution in the BTH soils. City classification analysis was conducted based on the derived pollution levels and urbanization degree, resulting in four city types: high urbanization and high pollution, high urbanization and low pollution, low urbanization and high pollution, and low urbanization and low pollution. Primary PAH sources include coal-burning (29%), coking (25%), traffic (25%), and biomass-burning (21%), with varying contributions based on city types. The overall order of human health risks was coal-burning ​> ​traffic ​> ​coking ​> ​biomass-burning sources. Finally, differen policies for soil PAH PAH management (such as energy transition and green infrastructure) were elaborated to promote coordinated development of regional urbanization environment. In summary, this research offers a comprehensive approach, linking processes to provide a precise understanding of pollution across different entities (cities, sources, and populations). Our findings reveal distinct pollution patterns across city types and highlight targeted mitigation priorities and provide a systematic, data-driven framework for regional soil PAH management and public health protection. © 2025 The Authors",,,,
"Projecting Forest Fire Probability in South Korea under Climate Change, Population, and Forest Management Scenarios Using AI & Process-Based Hybrid Model (FLAM-Net)","Climate change-induced heat waves and densely forested areas near urban centers in South Korea create complex challenges for wildfire response systems. Various forest fire models have been developed to address this, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Process-based models offer high interpretability through human domain knowledge but require extensive optimization, while machine learning models automatically identify important features but have limited interpretability. To leverage the strengths of both models, this study aimed to integrate human domain knowledge into a machine learning framework. IIASA's wildfire cLimate impacts and Adaptation Model (FLAM)—a process-based model incorporating biophysical and human impacts—was developed as a neural network called FLAM-Net. Enhancements included improving backpropagation for optimization and introducing algorithms for national-specific fire ignition dynamics. FLAM-Net was applied at multiple scales and integrated through U-Net-based architecture, named Deep Neural FLAM (DN-FLAM), to produce downscaled predictions. The optimization revealed spatial concentration of fires near metropolitan areas and the east coast, with temporal concentration in spring due to agricultural burning. Integration of multi-scale features through DN-FLAM achieved optimal performance with Pearson's r values of 0.943, 0.840, and 0.641 for temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal validations. Future projections based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) indicated increasing fire frequencies until 2050, followed by a decrease due to increased precipitation. This study demonstrates the benefits of the hybrid approach, providing interpretability, accuracy, and efficient optimization. These hybrid models offer scientific evidence to guide locally tailored decision-making for climate change-induced forest fires and lay the groundwork for global application through their optimization capabilities. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",,,,
An AI-Based Framework for Characterizing the Atmospheric Fate of Air Pollutants Within Diverse Environmental Settings,"This study introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI) modeling framework that combines machine learning algorithms optimized through metaheuristics with explainable AI to capture complex interactions among pollutant concentrations, meteorological data, and socio-economic indicators. Applied to a COVID-19-related dataset comprising 404 variables, with benzene concentrations as the target—measured using proton transfer reaction–mass spectrometry in Belgrade, Serbia—the framework demonstrated exceptional sensitivity in assessing the impact of complex environmental and societal changes during the pandemic. Explainable AI techniques, such as SHAP and SAGE, were employed to reveal the influence of each predictor, while the clustering of SHAP values identified distinct environmental settings that influenced benzene behavior. Three distinct settings were identified regarding benzene levels during the onset of the state of emergency. The first, involving local petroleum-related activities, biomass burning, chemical manufacturing, and traffic, led to a 15.7% reduction in benzene levels. The second, characterized by non-combustion processes, nocturnal chemistry, and the specific meteorological context, resulted in a 51.9% increase. The third, driven by local industrial processes, contributed to a modest 2.33% reduction. The study underscored the critical role of environmental settings in shaping air pollutant behavior, emphasizing the importance of integrating broader environmental contexts into models to gain a more comprehensive understanding of air pollutants and their dynamics. © 2025 by the authors.",,,,
Predicting opinion using deep learning: From burning to sustainable management of organic waste in Indian State of Punjab,"In winter season, the burning of crop residues for ease of sowing the next crop, along with industrial emissions and vehicular pollution leads to settling of a thick layer of smog in northern part of India. Therefore, to understand the opinion of farmers regarding sustainable management of organic waste, the present study was conducted in Ludhiana district of Indian state of Punjab. An ex post facto research design was used and a total of 800 dairy farmers having significant crop area were selected randomly for the study, grouped equally as small and large dairy farmers. Results revealed that majority of farmers had a highly favourable opinion regarding organic waste management due to the fact that they were aware of the ill-effects of undesirable practices like crop residue burning. Further, to predict the farmers’ opinion and the effect of independent variables on farmers’ opinion, a multi-layer perceptron feed-forward deep neural network was developed with mean squared error of 0.036 and 0.137 for validation and training data sets respectively, marking a novel approach of analysing farmers’ behaviour. The neural network highlighted that with increase in the magnitude of input variables, namely, education, experience in dairying, information source utilisation, knowledge regarding organic waste management, etc., the farmers’ opinion regarding sustainable waste management increases. The study concluded with the impression that cognitive processes like education, information and knowledge play a significant role in forming the opinion of the farmers. Therefore, efforts focusing on enhancing cognition should be made for sustainable management of organic waste. © The Author(s) 2023.",,,,
Simulation of Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation Using Near-Explicitly Predicted Products from Naphthalene Photooxidation in the Presence of NOx,"The atmospheric oxidation of naphthalene, found in automobile exhaust and biomass burning smoke, forms a secondary organic aerosol (SOA) with a high yield. In this study, a near-explicit gas mechanism for the photooxidation of naphthalene in the presence of NOx was derived using a box model platform. The naphthalene oxidation initiated by an OH radical produces various products, including naphthols, nitronaphthols, naphthoquinones, ring-opening products, and organonitrates. The resulting gas mechanism was applied to the UNIfied Partitioning Aerosol-phase Reaction (UNIPAR) model to predict SOA formation via multiphase reactions of naphthalene. Semiexplicitly predicted products were sorted to construct volatility-reactivity-based two-dimensional (2D) lumping species, which were used to process multiphase partitioning of organics and their heterogeneous chemistry to form SOA. The performance of the gas mechanism and the SOA model was demonstrated with data obtained from the photooxidation of naphthalene under varying conditions (NOx levels, humidity, temperature, and seed types) in a large outdoor photochemical smog chamber. Major products predicted from gas mechanisms were compared with products tentatively identified using proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry. The simulated organic-to-carbon ratio (0.72) using predicted SOA functional groups was compared with the ratio (0.70 ± 0.7) constructed from the analysis of chamber-generated SOA using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. Among environmental variables, NOx and temperature are influential in naphthalene SOA formation. A strong negative relationship appeared between SOA and NOx levels under hydrocarbon (HC)-limited regions (HC ppbC/NOx ppb <5) but a weakly positive relationship at NOx-limited regions. The impact of aqueous reactions on naphthalene SOA growth was insignificant regardless of inorganic seed types (inorganic aerosol liquid water content and seed aerosol acidity) due to poor solubility of naphthalene oxidation products in the inorganic aqueous phase. Under high NOx levels, SOA growth is dominated by organic-phase heterogeneous reactions of reactive, low-volatile multifunctional aldehydes. Both partitioning and heterogeneous reactions are, however, influential in naphthalene SOA formation under the NOx-limited regions. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",,,,
Examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban heat island and its impact on air pollution in Thailand,"Bangkok's, the capital of Thailand, rapid economic growth has led to a rising population and vehicle use, intensifying urban heat island (UHI) effects and air pollution. The relationship between UHI and air pollutants remains uncertain, influenced by factors such as location, spatial distribution, and the type of pollutants. Additionally, seasonality may contribute to this uncertainty, as UHI, land surface temperature, and air pollutants follow seasonal patterns. Understanding not only the relationship but also the trends in UHI and air pollution is crucial for gaining valuable insights that can help predict future scenarios and inform effective management and policy decisions. This study investigates the association between UHI and air pollution using data from the Sentinel-5P, which does not provide a single pollutant but instead offers measurements for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (HCHO), and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Terra MODIS. Rainfall and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are incorporated to analyze the factors influencing air pollution. Smoothed daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures (LST) from MODIS are converted to UHI in Bangkok Metropolitan and Vicinity from 2019 to 2023 by calculating the difference between LST and averaged LST within rural area. Their correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient) with air pollutants and trend analysis is demonstrated using data from individual location. The relationship analysis is divided into four cases: all data, winter, dry, and rainy seasons. The results indicated all air pollutants peak from winter to the dry season, corresponding to the agricultural burning period, except for O3, which peaks during the rainy season. The impact of UHI-pollutants correlations is evident, with NO2 levels peaking during the dry season in the daytime and AOD, CO, and HCHO levels peaking during the winter season at nighttime. Additionally, trend analysis revealed an increasing pattern in daytime UHI as well as in NO and SO2 levels, highlighting the potential intensification of urban heat and associated air pollution over time. The influence of NDVI remains inconclusive aligned with seasonal. We outline strategies to mitigate UHI and air pollution based on our findings. This research highlights the urgent need for international collaboration to reduce air pollution caused by burning activities. © 2025 The Author(s)",,,,
NEIVAv1.0: Next-generation Emissions InVentory expansion of Akagi et al. (2011) version 1.0,"Accurate representation of fire emissions is critical for modeling the in-plume, near-source, and remote effects of biomass burning (BB) on atmospheric composition, air quality, and climate. In recent years application of advanced instrumentation has significantly improved knowledge of the compounds emitted from fires, which, coupled with a large number of recent laboratory and field campaigns, has facilitated the emergence of new emission factor (EF) compilations. The Next-generation Emissions InVentory expansion of Akagi (NEIVA) version 1.0 is one such compilation in which the EFs for 14 globally relevant fuel and fire types have been updated to include data from recent studies, with a focus on gaseous non-methane organic compounds (NMOC_g). The data are stored in a series of connected tables that facilitate flexible querying from the individual study level to recommended averages of all laboratory and field data by fire type. The querying features are enabled by assignment of unique identifiers to all compounds and constituents, including thousands of NMOC_g. NEIVA also includes chemical and physical property data and model surrogate assignments for three widely used chemical mechanisms for each NMOC_g. NEIVA EF datasets are compared with recent publications and other EF compilations at the individual compound level and in the context of overall volatility distributions and hydroxyl (OH) reactivity (OHR) estimates. The NMOC_g in NEIVA include ∼ 4–8 times more compounds with improved representation of intermediate volatility organic compounds, resulting in much lower overall volatility (lowest-volatility bin shifted by as much as 3 orders of magnitude) and significantly higher OHR (up to 90 %) than other compilations. These updates can strongly impact model predictions of the effects of BB on atmospheric composition and chemistry. © Author(s) 2024.",,,,
Long-Term Retrospective Predicted Concentration of PM2.5 in Upper Northern Thailand Using Machine Learning Models,"This study aims to build, for the first time, a model that uses a machine learning (ML) approach to predict long-term retrospective PM2.5 concentrations in upper northern Thailand, a region impacted by biomass burning and transboundary pollution. The dataset includes PM10 levels, fire hotspots, and critical meteorological data from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2020. ML techniques, namely multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), multiple linear regression (MLR), decision tree (DT), and random forests (RF), were used to construct the prediction models. The best ML prediction model was selected considering root mean square error (RMSE), mean prediction error (MPE), relative prediction error (RPE) (the lower, the better), and coefficient of determination (R2) (the bigger, the better). Our study found that the ML model-based RF technique using PM10, CO2, O3, fire hotspots, air pressure, rainfall, relative humidity, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed performs the best when predicting the concentration of PM2.5 with an RMSE of 6.82 µg/m3, MPE of 4.33 µg/m3, RPE of 22.50%, and R2 of 0.93. The RF prediction model of PM2.5 used in this research could support further studies of the long-term effects of PM2.5 concentration on human health and related issues. © 2025 by the authors.",,,,
Climate-vegetation intersection in determining the burn rate in an area of the Brazilian Cerrado,"This study aimed to develop a predictive model, using climatic data and vegetation indices collected via satellite from 2001 to 2021, to estimate the daily burn rate in a protected area of the Brazilian Cerrado. For this purpose, data from the MODIS sensor was used, covering variables such as temperature, evapotranspiration, active fire, and burned area, complemented by climatic information from CHIRPS and Terraclimate products. The determination of the burn rate involved the polygonization of burned areas and the accounting of the duration of fires. In this context, machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and SVM were explored, implemented through the Scikit-learn library. The focus of the study was to evaluate which of these algorithms would show the most suitable performance in predictions. The results point to an annual average of 50,000 hectares affected by wildfires in the protected area and its vicinity, with notable variations over the years analyzed. A correlation was identified between the daily burn rate and variables such as wind speed and temperature, while NDVI and evapotranspiration showed an inversely proportional relationship. The results suggest that, among the tested models, Random Forest may have a relatively more efficient performance, standing out in the accuracy of predictions. However, it is emphasized that caution and additional studies are necessary to confirm these results. In summary, our foundings indicates the potential of machine learning techniques in environmental management of wildfires, potentially contributing to the protection of the Cerrado ecosystems, although further investigations are necessary for a more comprehensive understanding. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",,,,
Effects of the estimated inversion strength and aerosols on monthly variations of subtropical marine stratocumulus to the west of Africa,"Satellite and reanalysis data over the 2003–2022 period are used to study how the monthly variations of marine stratocumulus (MSc) to the west of Canary Islands and Namibia are influenced by thermodynamic variables and aerosols. Although the estimated inversion strength (EIS) has been thought to be the main predictor of low-cloud cover (LCC), the seasonal cycles of EIS and LCC differ significantly in the Canary MSc region. In linear regression models, adding dust aerosol (DA) optical depth as a predictor improves the prediction of LCC across all seasons and almost everywhere in the region compared to using EIS alone. In boreal summer, large amount of DAs are transported from the Sahara to the Canary MSc region. Analysis of the regression models shows that DAs contribute more than EIS to the Canary summer LCC maximum, reducing the error by up to 11 %. Biomass-burning aerosols (BBAs) also improve the prediction of LCC in the Canary MSc region, but less so than DAs, suggesting that BBAs are less effective as cloud condensation nucleii. Other known thermodynamic predictors of LCC (sea surface temperature, horizontal surface temperature advection, near-surface wind speed, and free-tropospheric relative humidity and vertical velocity) also improve the prediction, but much less effectively than the aerosols. In the Namibia MSc region, there are virtually no DAs but BBAs are abundant. There, EIS alone captures well the seasonal cycle of LCC. In this region, the effect of BBAs on LCC is hidden behind that of EIS, potentially because BBA optical depth and EIS coincidentally have similar seasonal cycles. © 2025 The Authors",,,,
Machine learning-enhanced combustion modeling for predicting laminar burning velocity of ammonia-hydrogen mixtures using improved reaction mechanisms,"The ammonia/hydrogen mixture is a promising zero-carbon fuel for internal combustion engines, with optimal efficiency in spark ignition engines at equivalence ratios of 0.6–1 and hydrogen fractions of 0.4–0.6. However, existing reaction mechanisms lose accuracy in this range, limiting combustion modeling. To address this, prediction accuracy is improved using refined reaction kinetics and machine learning algorithms. GRI Mech3.0 is refined by enhancing H/O, N2O, HNO, NH, and NH2 mechanisms, forming Model I for pure ammonia and Model II for lean burn ammonia-hydrogen mixtures. The simulated laminar burning speed of these models is compared with literature and seven other mechanisms. Combustion analysis includes sensitivity analysis of coefficients, nitric oxide emission rates, sub-mechanisms, and reaction sensitivities to assess their impact, with machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy. Model II achieves the highest accuracy under stoichiometric (RMSE = 1.4590 cm/s) and lean burn conditions (RMSE = 1.3701 cm/s). As different mechanisms suit various conditions, machine learning algorithms further enhance prediction accuracy. The support vector machine with particle swarm optimization improves computational accuracy by 2.9745 times over reaction kinetics, demonstrating its effectiveness. This study develops refined reaction mechanisms and machine learning models for practical applications in ammonia-hydrogen fueled SI engines. © 2025",,,,
"Evaluation of Air Quality by Particulate Matter in Junin and Huancavelica, Peru","Anthropogenic atmospheric particles with a diameter of less than 2.5µm (PM2.5) and between 2.5 to 10 µm (PM10) are among the main contributors to air pollution and have become a serious pollution threat in the Junin and Huancavelica region of Peru. This increase could be due to the burning of vegetation in the Amazon region of Brazil. Therefore, data obtained with the low-cost PA-II Purpleair sensor were analyzed to measure particulate matter (fine and coarse fashions) in the Junin region (Chanchamayo, station T. Huancayo, station T1 and Chupaca, station T3) and Huancavelica (Pampas, station T2). Likewise, the Hysplit model was used to quantify the transboundary wind trajectories from the Amazon region in Brazil to the Junin region in Peru. Shows that, during the rainy season, the maximum concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 are 151 µg.m-3 (station T1) and 178 µg.m-3 (station T1), respectively. Finally, the results of the air quality index (AQI) for PM2.5 allow for the classification of the Huancayo and Chanchamayo stations with “very bad” and “moderate to bad” air quality, respectively. Also, in Pampas and Chupaca, the AQI is classified as very unhealthy and hazardous on almost 50% and 43% of days, respectively. Copyright: © 2025 by the authors.",,,,
Damselflies and dragonflies in distress: The impact of forest fires and logging on odonate assemblages,"We assessed the impact of logging and forest fires on the species richness, evenness, and structure of odonate assemblages located on the island of Borneo. Landscape-scale species richness was highest in unburnt and once-burnt landscapes and lowest in two landscapes subjected to multiple burn events. These landscapes also had lower evenness compared to primary and once-burnt landscapes, highlighting the detrimental effects of repeated burn events on odonate species assemblages. There was significant geographic distance dependence in three of the six landscapes studied including primary and burnt landscapes. Odonate assemblages, furthermore, did not significantly deviate from Hubbell's neutral model predictions at metacommunity and local scales in any of the landscapes. Finally, we identified a significant association between species traits and environmental conditions, which appeared to be largely driven by disturbance. Landscapes subjected to multiple burn events in particular were largely populated by species associated with standing water bodies and with large geographical distributions. Our study emphasises how disturbances like burning and logging are associated with shifts in species composition, favouring species associated with disturbed environments, while reducing the prevalence of endemic species. © 2025 The Author(s)",,,,
"Ambient Measurements of Daytime Decay Rates of Levoglucosan, Mannosan, and Galactosan","Quantifying atmospheric degradation of levoglucosan, a highly specific molecular marker for biomass burning (BB) aerosols, is essential in assessing impacts of BB on air quality and climate. However, the stability of levoglucosan in the atmosphere has only been evaluated through laboratory experiments or model simulations. Here, we investigated the atmospheric stability of levoglucosan and its two co-emitting isomers, mannosan and galactosan, utilizing bihourly measurement data at a suburban site in Hong Kong over a period of 4 months. The concentrations of the three saccharides, upon normalization by BB-derived potassium, displayed a distinct and consistent depletion during daytime hours from 08:00 to 16:00, which follows an exponential decay pattern. We calculated individual daytime decay rate constants of the three saccharides by utilizing their day-by-day decay kinetics. The decay rates of mannosan and galactosan were 34% and 40% higher than that of levoglucosan. The estimated lifetime of levoglucosan was 13 ± 7 hr, ranging from 3 to 46 hr under the atmospheric condition of temperature of 22 ± 5°C, and a relative humidity of 55 ± 14%. This work provides the first kinetic data of levoglucosan degradation derived from real ambient measurements. They are valuable for refining model predictions concerning BB aerosol impacts on local, regional, and global scales. © 2025. The Author(s).",,,,
Consistency of Aerosol Optical Properties between MODIS Satellite Retrievals and AERONET over a 14-Year Period in Central–East Europe,"Aerosols influence Earth’s climate by interacting with radiation and clouds. Remote sensing techniques aim to enhance our understanding of aerosol forcing using ground-based and satellite retrievals. Despite technological advancements, challenges persist in reducing uncertainties in satellite remote sensing. Our study examines retrieval biases in MODIS sensors on Terra and Aqua satellites compared to AERONET ground-based measurements. We assess their performance and the correlation with the AERONET aerosol optical depth (AOD) using 14 years of data (2010–2023) from 29 AERONET stations across 10 Central–East European countries. The results indicate discrepancies between MODIS Terra and Aqua retrievals: Terra overestimates the AOD at 16 AERONET stations, while Aqua underestimates the AOD at 21 stations. The examination of temporal biases in the AOD using the calculated estimated error (ER) between AERONET and MODIS retrievals reveals a notable seasonality in coincident retrievals. Both sensors show higher positive AOD biases against AERONET in spring and summer compared to fall and winter, with few ER values for Aqua indicating poor agreement with AERONET. Seasonal variations in correlation strength were noted, with significant improvements from winter to summer (from R2 of 0.58 in winter to R2 of 0.76 in summer for MODIS Terra and from R2 of 0.53 in winter to R2 of 0.74 in summer for MODIS Aqua). Over the fourteen-year period, monthly mean aerosol AOD trends indicate a decrease of −0.00027 from AERONET retrievals and negative monthly mean trends of the AOD from collocated MODIS Terra and Aqua retrievals of −0.00023 and −0.00025, respectively. An aerosol classification analysis showed that mixed aerosols comprised over 30% of the total aerosol composition, while polluted aerosols accounted for more than 22%, and continental aerosols contributed between 22% and 24%. The remaining 20% consists of biomass-burning, dust, and marine aerosols. Based on the aerosol classification method, we computed the bias between the AERONET AE and MODIS AE, which showed higher AE values for AERONET retrievals for a mixture of aerosols and biomass burning, while for marine aerosols, the MODIS AE was larger and for dust the results were inconclusive. © 2024 by the authors.",,,,
Termite gut microbiome being a rich source of potential lignocellulolytic bacterial strains,"A study was carried out to identify prospective cellulose degrading bacteria isolated from termite gut collected from various agriculture sites. Eight of the bacterial isolates displayed a very distinct zone of clearing on CMC (Carboxylmethyl cellulose) agar media after staining with 1% Congo red, indicating that they may have cellulose degrading ability. On a CMC agar plate, CRDB6 had the largest colony diameter (3.08 cm) as well as clear zone diameter (0.96 cm), however CRDB 1 has maximum cellulolytic activity (1.45 cm) followed by CRDB5 and CRDB6 (1.33 cm and 1.28 cm) respectively. CRDB3, CRDB4 and CRDB9 showed Gram negative reaction among crop residue degrading bacterial isolates, while the remainder showed Gram positive reaction. The morphological characteristics of the bacteria isolates, such as colony shape, elevation, margin, colour and opacity, differed. Isolates CRDB6 produced highest β-glucosidase activity (12.66 m L-1) followed by CRDB1 (12.20 mg m L-1) and CRDB5 (10.21 m L-1) in Luria broth culture. Indole acetic acid production (with tryptophan) was greater in CRDB1 (389.33 mg/ml), CRDB6 (356.9 m L-1) and CRDB3 (315.96 m L-1) while as P-solubilization potential was peaked in CRDB6 (2.41 m L-1) followed by CRDB4 (1.76 m L-1) and CRDB3. Overall, isolate CRDB6 exhibited the highest cellulolytic activity as compared to rest of the bacterial isolates. These results will help in preparing bacterial consortia for the management of crop residues. © 2024 World Researchers Associations. All rights reserved.",,,,
Aerosol classification by application of machine learning spectral clustering algorithm,"Precise understanding of aerosol classification is crucial for accurately quantifying the effects of aerosols on the Earth's energy budget, improving remote sensing retrieval algorithms, formulating climate change-related policies, and more. In this study, we used aerosol measurements from the quality assured AERosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) and utilized a multivariate spectral clustering algorithm, a machine learning tool, to classify global aerosols. The spectral clustering algorithm is a variant of the clustering algorithm that employs eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data matrix to project the data into a lower-dimensional space of a similar cluster. To accomplish this, we considered five aerosol optical parameters: fine-mode Aerosol Optical Depth, Extinction Angstrom Exponent, Absorption Angstrom Exponent, Single Scattering Albedo, and Refractive Index from 150 AERONET sites distributed in six continents (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America) during 1993 to 2022. Using the clustering analysis, we identified four primary aerosol types: dust, urban, biomass burning, and mixed aerosols. Among the continents, the African and Asian sites exhibited the highest contribution of dust aerosols, as the region has significant global dust sources. Conversely, Australia, Europe, North, and South America are predominantly influenced by fine-mode aerosols, given their considerable distance from major dust source regions. © 2023 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",,,,
Modeling air pollution around major dumpsites in Lagos State using geospatial methods with solutions,"Air pollution is gradually becoming a major health concern globally and Nigeria is especially susceptible to air pollution Available data indicates that vehicular traffics, industries, wildfire and biomass burning are significant sources of air pollutants such as Particulate Matter PM, Carbon Monoxide CO, Nitrogen Dioxide NO2, Sulphur Dioxide SO2 and Volatile Organic Compounds VOCs in the air in Lagos State. The aim of this study is to perform geospatial modelling of air pollution around Olusosun and Solous dumpsites in Lagos State. The study analyses, assesses, and predicts air pollution emission in these dumpsites and examines their possible health impact on residents. Using both ground and satellite-based data, different GIS techniques were used to model this pollution concentration. These methods include Kriging, Regression, and Landfill Gas Emissions Model (LANDGEM) which helps to analyse, model and predict the air pollutant levels around these dumpsite. The average pollution level of Particulate Matter with a diameter that is 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) in Olusosun was 94.29 μg/m3 while those in Solous was 94.12 μg/m3 over a 24 h period. This is way above the Air Quality Guideline recommended by the WHO which is 15 μg/m3 over a 24 h period. This is similar to the high pollution level of NO2 which was 237.64 μg/m3 in Olusosun and 255.84 μg/m3 in Solous as against the WHO Air Quality Guideline of 25 μg/m3 over a 24 h period. SO2 level is also varyingly high in Olusosun and Solous. The reading of 109.27 μg/m3 in Olusosun is considerably high as compared to the reading of 43.82 μg/m3 in Solous. However, both readings are relatively higher than the Air Quality Guideline recommended by the WHO which was 40 μg/m3. The CO air quality level of 0.55 mg/m3 in Olusosun and 0.52 mg/m3 in Solous is within the accepted level of the Air Quality Guideline recommended by the WHO. This shows that CO is not a pollution threat in the major dumpsites in Lagos. This is similar to the readings of PM5 and PM10 which are within the WHO Air Quality Guidelines over a 24 h period. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data shows a trend of increasing concentration of PM2.5 over the 5 study months due to an increase in the quantity of waste disposal, which shows that high waste disposal is directly proportional to high level of PM2.5. It is recommended that living farther (more than 15 km) away from the dumpsites can reduce the high risk of air pollution and its related diseases for residents. Also, there is need for proper incineration and maintenance of waste to reduce the level of air and other pollutants in and around the dumpsites. © 2024",,,,
Global aerosol-type classification using a new hybrid algorithm and Aerosol Robotic Network data,"The properties of aerosols are highly uncertain owing to the complex changes in their composition in different regions. The radiative properties of different aerosol types differ considerably and are vital for studying aerosol regional and/or global climate effects. Traditional aerosol-type identification algorithms, generally based on cluster or empirical analysis methods, are often inaccurate and time-consuming. In response, our study aimed to develop a new aerosol-type classification model using an innovative hybrid algorithm to improve the precision and efficiency of aerosol-type identification. This novel algorithm incorporates an optical database, constructed using the Mie scattering model, and employs a random forest algorithm to classify different aerosol types based on the optical data from the database. The complex refractive index was used as a baseline to assess the performance of our hybrid algorithm against the traditional Gaussian kernel density clustering method for aerosol-type identification. The hybrid algorithm demonstrated impressive consistency rates of 90 %, 85 %, 84 %, 84 %, and 100 % for dust, mixed-coarse (mixed, course-mode aerosol), mixed-fine (mixed, fine-mode aerosol), urban/industrial, and biomass burning aerosols, respectively. Moreover, it achieved remarkable precision, with evaluation metric indexes for micro-precision, micro-recall, micro-F1-score, and accuracy of 95 %, 89 %, 91 %, and 89 %, respectively. Lastly, a global map of aerosol types was generated using the new hybrid algorithm to characterize aerosol types across the five continents. This study, utilizing a novel approach for the classification of aerosol, will help improve the accuracy of aerosol inversion and determine the sources of aerosol pollution. © Author(s) 2024.",,,,
AEROSOL CLASSIFICATION IN CYPRUS USING ACTIVE AND PASSIVE REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES,"Limassol region in Cyprus, located in the Eastern Mediterranean, represents a major crossroads for various air masses, making the place a hub for mixing particles from both local and remote aerosol sources. The unique atmospheric conditions of the area offer an ideal place to study the vertical atmospheric structure. This study utilizes active and passive remote sensing techniques, such as the sun-photometer AERONET CUT-TEPAK station (Aerosol Robotic Network) and the Polly XT Raman LIDAR depolarization system available in Limassol (34.7°N, 33°E). An extended analysis of long-term ground-based measurements using AERONET Level 2.0 solar products is presented. The study focuses on the classification method proposed by Toledano et al. (2007) [1] for different aerosol types. Aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD) and Ångström Exponent at 440-870 nm (AE) are examined for 14 years (2010 - 2023). The results show a strong contribution of dust particles in spring months and continental particles in summer periods. Marine particles were found to be extremely dominant according to the classification. Subsequently, to examine the presence of dust particles in the marine's classification, the study incorporates the particle depolarization ratio (PDR) from the LIDAR vertical profiles at 532 nm using the Klett method. Thus, a new aerosol scheme has been developed concluding in four aerosol categories (dominating conditions of marine aerosol (M), mineral dust (D), anthropogenic haze/ biomass burning (H+S), mixed aerosol). © 2024 SPIE.",,,,
Modeling Novel Aqueous Particle and Cloud Chemistry Processes of Biomass Burning Phenols and Their Potential to Form Secondary Organic Aerosols,"Phenols emitted from biomass burning contribute significantly to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation through the partitioning of semivolatile products formed from gas-phase chemistry and multiphase chemistry in aerosol liquid water and clouds. The aqueous-phase SOA (aqSOA) formed via hydroxyl radical (•OH), singlet molecular oxygen (1O2*), and triplet excited states of organic compounds (3C*), which oxidize dissolved phenols in the aqueous phase, might play a significant role in the evolution of organic aerosol (OA). However, a quantitative and predictive understanding of aqSOA has been challenging. Here, we develop a stand-alone box model to investigate the formation of SOA from gas-phase •OH chemistry and aqSOA formed by the dissolution of phenols followed by their aqueous-phase reactions with •OH, 1O2*, and 3C* in cloud droplets and aerosol liquid water. We investigate four phenolic compounds, i.e., phenol, guaiacol, syringol, and guaiacyl acetone (GA), which represent some of the key potential sources of aqSOA from biomass burning in clouds. For the same initial precursor organic gas that dissolves in aerosol/cloud liquid water and subsequently reacts with aqueous phase oxidants, we predict that the aqSOA formation potential (defined as aqSOA formed per unit dissolved organic gas concentration) of these phenols is higher than that of isoprene-epoxydiol (IEPOX), a well-known aqSOA precursor. Cloud droplets can dissolve a broader range of soluble phenols compared to aqueous aerosols, since the liquid water contents of aerosols are orders of magnitude smaller than cloud droplets. Our simulations suggest that highly soluble and reactive multifunctional phenols like GA would predominantly undergo cloud chemistry within cloud layers, while gas-phase chemistry is likely to be more important for less soluble phenols. But in the absence of clouds, the condensation of low-volatility products from gas-phase oxidation followed by their reversible partitioning to organic aerosols dominates SOA formation, while the SOA formed through aqueous aerosol chemistry increases with relative humidity (RH), approaching 40% of the sum of gas and aqueous aerosol chemistry at 95% RH for GA. Our model developments of biomass-burning phenols and their aqueous chemistry can be readily implemented in regional and global atmospheric chemistry models to investigate the aqueous aerosol and cloud chemistry of biomass-burning organic gases in the atmosphere. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",,,,
The newest emission inventory of anthropogenic full-volatility organic in Central China,"Organic aerosol (OA) is the largest and most complicated component of aerosols that has significant impacts on human health and global climate. However, current models cannot accurately predict the concentrations and sources of primary and secondary OA due to the oversimplification of traditional organic emission inventories. Traditional emission inventories do not consider important precursors of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), such as semi-volatile and intermediate-volatility organic compounds (SVOCs and IVOCs). To improve the accuracy of OA prediction and source identification, it is essential to refine precursor emissions. In this study, a full-volatility organic compounds emission inventory was established for the Central China, with Henan Province as a representative in 2020. The anthropogenic emissions of ultralow volatility organic compounds (xLVOCs), SVOCs, IVOCs, and VOCs were 53.9 kt, 55.3 kt, 182.1 kt, and 586.3 kt, respectively, effectively filling the gap of 181.3 kt in traditional organic compound emission inventory. Residential biomass burning was identified as the primary contribution source for xLVOCs and SVOCs, accounting for 70.1% and 42.2%, respectively. Industrial process was the main contributor for IVOCs and VOCs, accounting for 31.7% and 44.0% of their emissions, respectively. Meanwhile, the emission of volatile organic compound from different sources showed an increasing trend as volatility increased. The gas-phase emission was 212.1 kt, primarily from industrial process (33.9% contribution), while the particle-phase emission was 79.2 kt, mainly from domestic biomass combustion (65.0% contribution). xLVOCs and SVOCs emissions were mainly concentrated in cities with agricultural activities, such as Zhoukou, while IVOCs and VOCs were concentrated in highly industrialized and urbanized areas, such as Zhengzhou. It is hoped that the incompleteness of emission factors (EFs) for full-volatility organic compounds, which mainly contributes to the uncertainty of this study's results, can be further improved to better understand source contributions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
Global expansion of wildland-urban interface (WUI) and WUI fires: insights from a multiyear worldwide unified database (WUWUI),"Fires in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) are an important issue globally. To understand the change of WUI, we develop a 9 km worldwide unified wildland-urban interface database for 2001-2020 with Random Forest models and satellite data. We find that WUI has been increasing in all populated continents from 2001 to 2020 and the global relative increase is 24%, with the largest relative increase (∼59%) over Africa. Global total fire counts decrease by 10% from 2005 to 2020, whereas the WUI fraction of fire counts increases by 23%. The global total burned area decreases by 22% from 2005 to 2020, whereas the WUI fraction of burned area increases by 35%. These are mainly due to the expansion of WUI area. On all the populated continents, the WUI fractions of fire counts are higher than the WUI fractions of burned area, implying that WUI fires tend to have smaller sizes than wildland fires. We also project future WUI changes for the years 2030 and 2040, together with the projection of future fire burned area under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) scenarios in the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). The projected global WUI fraction (excluding Antarctica and the oceans) is 5.9% in 2040 compared to 4.8% in 2020. The global WUI fraction of burned area is projected to increase from now to 2040 under most scenarios analyzed in this study, unless the WUI area stays at the 2020 level together with the projected burned area under SSP4-4.5. This study is a first step to understanding the changes of WUI fires at the global scale and demonstrates a growing importance of WUI fires. The global multi-year WUI and WUI fire datasets developed in this study can facilitate future work quantifying the impacts of WUI fires on air quality and climate. © 2024 The Author(s).

Innovations and advances in enzymatic deconstruction of biomass and their sustainability analysis: A review,"Increasing population and continuously growing food demand has led to an overwhelming production of agro waste. Further the improper management of agro waste and stubble burning leads to harmful emissions (especially GHG emissions) into the atmosphere. The conversion of waste into biofuels is a highly lucrative option considering the utilization of waste and its use as an alternative to fossil fuel. However, it needs to tackle the obstacles in proper transportation of waste to the site of conversion or biorefineries, technical issues in the pre-treatment, high moisture content in the feedstock, compositional variations in the feedstock, enzymatic efficiency of the saccharifying enzymes, and the various other steps used in the conversion of biomass from raw material to end product. And when all these factors are optimized, the cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness of the processes and the product have to be considered. This review sheds light upon the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass for conversion into biofuels in biorefineries with a major emphasis on bioethanol. This review describes the innovations and advances made to increase the cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness of alternative fuels such as bioethanol, highlighting recent developments in pretreatment methods, enzymatic saccharification as well as their sustainability analysis. In recent past, advanced methods such as CRISPR-Cas gene editing and artificial intelligence have emerged as powerful tools for microbial modification in biofuel production. The recent advancements and achievements in the field, including the gene editing of microbial strains with enhanced biofuel production capabilities which would revolutionize the industry are highlighted. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Wildfire Scenarios for Assessing Risk of Cover Loss in a Megadiverse Zone within the Colombian Caribbean,"Rising wildfire incidents in South America, potentially exacerbated by climate change, require an exploration of sustainable approaches for fire risk reduction. This study investigates wildfire-prone meteorological conditions and assesses the susceptibility in Colombia’s megadiverse northern region. Utilizing this knowledge, we apply a machine learning model and the Monte Carlo approach to evaluate sustainability strategies for mitigating fire risk. The findings indicate that a substantial number of fires occur in the southern region, especially in the first two seasons of the year, and in the northeast in the last two seasons. Both are characterized by high temperatures, minimal precipitation, strong winds, and dry conditions. The developed model demonstrates significant predictive accuracy with the HIT, FAR, and POC of 87.9%, 28.3%, and 95.7%, respectively, providing insights into the probabilistic aspects of fire development. Various scenarios showed that a decrease in soil temperature reduces the risk mostly in lower altitudes and leaf skin reservoir content in the highest altitudes, as well as in the north region. Sustainability strategies, such as tree belts, agroforestry mosaics, and forest corridors emerge as crucial measures. The results underscore the importance of proactive measures in mitigating wildfire impact, offering actionable insights for crafting effective sustainability strategies amid escalating fire risks. © 2024 by the authors.",,,,
Mercury stable isotopes revealing the atmospheric mercury circulation: A review of particulate bound mercury in China,"Human activities since industrialization have significantly raised global atmospheric mercury (Hg) levels. China's high Hg emissions with rapid industrial development have a global impact on implementing the Minamata Convention on Mercury due to the dispersion of atmospheric Hg. Here, we comprehensively reviewed the atmospheric particulate bound mercury (PBM) in China, given its highest deposition rate, aiming to elucidate Hg sources, transformation, and geochemical cycles. Firstly, we analyzed its spatiotemporal distribution and long-term trends in China by synthesizing published literature. Most of the studies were conducted in eastern China, where PBM concentrations are higher than in western China due to extensive anthropogenic emissions. Furthermore, meteorological factors and atmospheric transport significantly affect seasonal PBM variations. Local anthropogenic sources, atmospheric transport, and local atmospheric transformation contribute 56.2%, 14.9%, and 29.0% to China's PBM content, respectively. Notably, China's atmospheric PBM concentrations have declined significantly since 2015. Secondly, we compiled a comprehensive global Hg isotope dataset and employed structural equation modeling to quantify Hg geochemical cycling. The isotope ratios of atmospheric Hg primarily overlap with those of Hg raw materials and vegetation. The significant relationship (P < 0.01) between atmospheric Hg and Hg raw materials (0.91) and vegetation (1.78) suggests that they contribute significantly to atmospheric Hg. Besides water and fish, atmospheric Hg also shows a high regression coefficient with human Hg, raising concerns about direct human inhalation of atmospheric Hg. Thirdly, we combined compiled Hg isotopes with machine learning to predict PBM sources in China. Industrial activities, biomass burning, and soil/dust are the primary contributors to PBM in China, accounting for 58.67%, 22.11%, and 17.14%, respectively. Our findings indicate that the contribution of soil/dust to PBM, ranging from 0.51% to 56.42%, has been underrated in previous studies. It is feasible to trace atmospheric Hg transport using Hg isotopes, as PBM mainly undergoes photoreduction reactions, but quantifying regional Hg transport remains challenging. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
Assessing Fire Regimes in the Paraguayan Chaco: Implications for Ecological and Fire Management,"This study analyzed the fire regime in the highly diverse Paraguayan Chaco, focusing on different aspects of fire patterns, including spatial (area burned) and temporal (frequency) aspects and magnitude (severity). We focused on fire as it is a natural phenomenon that drives ecosystem change and has significant economic, ecological and social impacts of particular concern in vulnerable ecosystems. Using the K-means clustering technique, we identified four distinct fire regimes in the study region: High (H), Moderately High (MH), Moderately Low (ML) and Low (L). On the one hand, the Dry Chaco predominantly featured Low and Moderately High regimes, characterized by a low fire frequency due to arid conditions. On the other hand, the Humid Chaco was particularly affected by agricultural burning, driven by extensive livestock activity and higher biomass productivity. Finally, in the Pantanal, the variations in fire intensity were influenced by flood pulses and rainfall patterns. Our findings highlight the distinct fire regimes across the Paraguayan Chaco and detail the differences in the regimes. The study’s findings are valuable for developing efficient management strategies that account for fire behaviour during agricultural burning in this poorly studied region. © 2024 by the authors.",,,,
Future projections of Siberian wildfire and aerosol emissions,"Wildfires are among the most influential disturbances affecting ecosystem structure and biogeochemical cycles in Siberia. Therefore, accurate fire modeling via dynamic global vegetation models is important for predicting greenhouse gas emissions and other biomass-burning emissions to understand changes in biogeochemical cycles. We integrated the widely used SPread and InTensity of FIRE (SPITFIRE) fire module into the spatially explicit individual-based dynamic global vegetation model (SEIB-DGVM) to improve the accuracy of fire predictions and then simulated future fire regimes to better understand their impacts. The model can reproduce the spatiotemporal variation in biomass, fire intensity, and fire-related emissions well compared to the recent satellite-based estimations: aboveground biomass (R2 = 0.847, RMSE =18.3 Mg ha−1), burned fraction (R2 = 0.75, RMSE= 0.01), burned area (R2 = 0.609, RMSE = 690 ha), dry-matter emissions (R2 = 0.624, RMSE = 0.01 kg DM m−2; dry matter), and CO2 emissions (R2 = 0.705, RMSE = 6.79 Tg). We then predicted that all of the 33 fire-related gas and aerosol emissions would increase in the future due to the enhanced amount of litter as fuel load from increasing forest biomass production under climate forcing of four Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP8.5, RCP6.0, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6. The simulation under RCP8.5 showed that the CO2, CO, PM2.5, total particulate matter (TPM), and total particulate carbon (TPC) emissions in Siberia in the present period (2000–2020) will increase relatively by 189.66±6.55, 15.18±0.52, 2.47±0.09, 1.87±0.06, and 1.30±0.04 Tg species yr−1, respectively, in the future period (2081–2100) and the number of burned trees will increase by 100 %, resulting in a 385.19 ± 40.4 g C m−2 yr−1 loss of net primary production (NPP). Another key finding is that the higher litter moisture by higher precipitation would relatively suppress the increment of fire-related emissions; thus the simulation under RCP8.5 showed the lowest emissions among RCPs. Our study offers insights into future fire regimes and development strategies for enhancing regional resilience and for mitigating the broader environmental consequences of fire activity in Siberia. © Author(s) 2024.",,,,
"Analysis of the Influencing Factors and Sources of Brown Carbon Light Absorption in a Typical Megacity of the Yangtze River Delta, China","Brown carbon (BrC) is a new term for organic aerosol (OA) with strong absorption ability from the visible to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, which plays a vital role in atmospheric visibility and climate change. Herein, we report field measurements from 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021, sampled at urban Suzhou, Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, to investigate the optical properties and sources of BrC. By analyzing the seasonal characteristics of the absorption of BrC at 370 nm (babs370), babs370 was found to be the highest (9.0 ± 7.2 Mm−1) in winter and the lowest (5.1 ± 3.3 Mm−1) in summer, respectively. The absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) value of BrC in winter was 1.22 ± 0.05, followed by 1.21 ± 0.05, 1.20 ± 0.05, and 1.19 ± 0.05 for fall, spring, and summer, respectively. The mass absorption cross-section (MAC) of secondary organic carbon (SOC) was 3.3 ± 0.2 m2g−1 in spring, 2.9 ± 0.1 m2g−1 in summer, 4.3 ± 0.1 m2g−1 in fall, and 2.8 ± 0.2 m2g−1 in winter, significantly lower than that of primary organic carbon (POC) at 370 nm, suggesting the aging process could weaken the light absorption of BrC. Five different BrC factors were identified by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, including biomass-burning-related, vehicle-related, sulfate-related, nitrate-related, and dust-related factors, which on average account for 7.4%, 73.4%, 11.9%, 1.9%, and 5.4% of babs370, respectively. Potential Source Contribution Factor (PSCF) analysis showed that those high babs370 periods were mainly contributed by air mass from the south. Moreover, for the influence degree of the potential source areas, the sequence was winter > spring > fall > summer. Our results improve the understanding of BrC in an important industrial city in YRD, which could reduce the uncertainty of the prediction of its climate effect in this region. © 2024 by the authors.",,,,
A Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Approaches for Fire Hotspots Prediction in Thailand,"Northern Thailand faces a recurring ecological threat: forest fires. These fires, prevalent during the dry season, spread rapidly and consume vital forest fuels. Human activities exacerbate the problem, with agricultural burning of forests, grasses, and crop residues contributing to the fire regime. These fires not only alter forest structure, but also produce harmful PM10 and PM2.5 particles that threaten public health. The purpose of this work is to perform a comparative analysis of two deep learning approaches, including single and hybrid, for fire hotspots prediction. The dataset was acquired from NASA's MODIS and VIIRS S-NPP satellite, covering the period from January 2012 to February 2024. The dataset values were pre-processed by coding and normalization. The pairwise correlation coefficient between each feature and the number of hotspots was calculated and then sorted in descending order. Based on these correlation values, a dimensionality reduction step was performed to reduce the number of features from 4 to 2 for each experiment. The prepared dataset was then divided into 80% and 20%. Four deep learning models were trained and three error metrics were used to objectively evaluate the model performance. The investigation showed that the single approach using LSTM algorithm had promising results in identifying fire hotspots in Thailand, especially when using data from the VIIRS S-NPP dataset with two or three attributes: confidence, bright-ti5, and frp or confident and bright-ti5.  © 2024 IEEE.",,,,
Morphological and Elemental Classification of Freshly-Emitted Individual Particles From Field and Laboratory Residential Biomass Burning,"Residential biomass burning significantly contributes to air pollution in developing countries. However, the microscopic properties of individual particles in their emissions have not been well understood. In this study, individual primary particles from 14 kinds of biomass fuels (including firewood, crop residue, and animal dung) were collected in laboratory and field measurements, and their morphology, composition and mixing state were acquired using transmission electron microscope. These results constitute a source profile database of individual primary particles from residential biomass burning. The database reveals that different types of biomass fuels exhibit different emission characteristics, that is, residential firewood burning mainly emits pure carbonaceous particles (including organic matter (OM) and soot particles), crop residue burning mainly emits K-containing particles (including OM-K, soot(-OM)-K, and K-rich particles), and animal dung burning mainly emits pure carbonaceous particles and K-containing particles. Moreover, our results indicate that the emission characteristics obtained from laboratory and field measurements are different. Field measurements conducted in two selected villages in North China Plain exhibit a higher presence of soot particles compared to laboratory measurements, owing to their higher combustion temperatures. In contrast, field measurements conducted in one selected village in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau contain less soot particles than those from laboratory measurements in plain areas, due to the deficient oxygen supply during combustion process in the high-altitude regions. These results warn us that the emission estimation from residential biomass burning should notice the large emission differences among different biomass types and between field and laboratory measurements. © 2024.

Extraction of tracer elements of particulate matter emission source using association rule mining,"The source marker species represent the emission source in the ambient air. It aids in identifying specific emission sources, but it can deliver ambiguous results when similar species exhibit different emission sources. Therefore, robust marker/tracer species are always needed to clearly identify emission source. This study collected tracer elemental species for possible emission sources from Indian published literature and processed them by using machine learning-based apriori algorithm to obtain robust elemental marker of the emission source. Initially, significant rules were chosen with support >10% and lift >1.0. Subsequently, elemental markers have obtained by applying constraint i.e. conviction ≥1.1, lift ≥1.4 and confidence ≥20%. As an outcome, it reveals elemental markers of crustal emission (CE) (Al, Si, Fe, Ca, Mg, Ti), sea salt (SS) (Na, K), biomass burning (BB) (K), solid waste burning (SWB) (Ba, Cd, Cr, Sr), coal combustion (CC) (As, Se, Cr, Cd), oil combustion (OC) (V, Ni, S, As), and traffic emission (TE) (Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn, Cd, Ni). Finally, robust elemental markers corresponding to their respective emission source were derived by applying constraint of conviction ≥1.1, lift ≥1.5 and confidence ≥50% on the previously extracted association rule. Consequently, it defined CE by Mg, Al, Ca, Si, Fe, SS by Na, K, TE by Cu, Pb, Mn, Zn, SWB by Ba, Cr, Cd, Sr, OC by V, Ni, S, and CC by Se, As. Additionally, this study also demonstrate the successful implementation of the apriori algorithm for the aforementioned task. © 2024 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",,,,
Seasonal variations in photooxidant formation and light absorption in aqueous extracts of ambient particles,"Fog/cloud drops and aerosol liquid water are important sites for the transformations of atmospheric species, largely through reactions with photoformed oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical (OH), singlet molecular oxygen (1O2 -), and oxidizing triplet excited states of organic matter (3C -). Despite their importance, few studies have measured these oxidants or their seasonal variations. To address this gap, we collected ambient PM2.5 from Davis, California, over the course of a year and measured photooxidant concentrations and light absorption in dilute aqueous extracts. Mass absorption coefficients (MACs) normalized by dissolved organic carbon range from 0.4-3.8 m2 per gram C at 300 nm. Concentrations of OH, 1O2 -, and 3C - in the extracts range from (0.2-4.7) × 10-15 M, (0.7-45) × 10-13 M, and (0.03-7.9) × 10-13 M, respectively, with biomass burning brown carbon playing a major role in light absorption and the formation of 1O2 - and 3C -. Extrapolating photooxidant kinetics from our dilute particle extracts to concentrated aerosol liquid water (ALW) conditions gives an estimated OH concentration of 7 × 10-15 M and ranges for 1O2 - and 3C - of (0.6-7) × 10-12 M and (0.2-1) × 10-12 M, respectively. Compared to the results in Kaur et al. (2019), our ALW predictions show roughly 10 times higher OH, up to 5 times higher 3C, and 1O2 - concentrations that are lower by factors of 20-100. These concentrations suggest that 3C - and 1O2 - in ALW dominate the processing of organic compounds that react quickly with these oxidants (e.g., phenols and furans, respectively), while OH is more important for less reactive organics.  © Copyright: ",,,,
Integrated municipal management of waste from tree pruning and removal,"Urban forests generate a significant amount of waste from leaf fall, pruning and removal of trees. This lignocellulosic material is typically used for composting, burned (with or without energy generation) or disposed in landfills. Despite its potential use for environmentally friendly purposes, access to the material is still limited, mainly due to the lack of knowledge about its generation and quantity, difficulties in sorting, and issues related to the transport and storage of this waste. Thus, this article characterizes an urban afforestation system, quantifies the generation of waste, and proposes an integrated municipal system for the use of this waste material. After describing the procedures and operations performed for tree pruning and removal, we report a case study of the city of Piracicaba, São Paulo State, Brazil, covering a period of 15 months. We adjusted empirical equations (Log Spurr, Spurr, and Schumacher-Hall models) to estimate the volume of waste produced, serving as a basis for the development of waste quantification methods. The city was estimated to generate an average of 180 tons of afforestation waste per month, composed mainly of leaves and thin branches (69%). Composting alone was considered an inefficient use of the material (about 31% of waste is not beneficially utilized). This material can be applied for the production of different products with high added value. Models to predict the generation of waste can contribute to the planning of municipal waste management. The Schumacher-Hall and Log Spurr models produced the best results. In general, the results indicated that adequate urban planning can help reduce waste disposal and burning by local governments. Additionally, carrying out the quantification of waste and exploring the use of new recovery measures of waste from urban afforestation can help support sustainable local development. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH",,,,
Synthesis and characterization of biochar from dehradun rice straw and its application for adsorption of methylene blue dye,"Stubble management and burning is one of the major concerns in India, which creates environmental pollution and decreases in the air quality index in many Indian cities. Conversion of stubble into biochar is an eco-friendly way to manage stubble burning. In the current study, Dehradun rice straw has been used to synthesize biochar by the method of pyrolysis and acid activation. The biochar synthesized was characterized by the aid of SEM and EDAX techniques. The synthesized biochar after activation exhibited significant porosity and surface area. The results of methylene blue adsorption with the aid of rice straw biochar showed significant adsorption capacity at a concentration of 2mg/mL biochar at room temperature.  © 2023 Author(s).",,,,
"Fire in highland grasslands in the Atlantic Forest Biome, a burned areas time series analysis and its correlation with the legislation","Fire has been an intrinsic ecological component of the ecosystems, affecting the public, economic, and socio-cultural policies of human-nature interactions. Using fire over grassland vegetation is a traditional practice for livestock in the highland grasslands and has economic and environmental consequences that have not yet been understood. A better description of the spatio-temporal biomass burning patterns is needed to analyze the effects of creation and application in these areas. This study used remote sensing techniques based on Sentinel-2 data and machine learning algorithms to identify burning scars and compare them with a national fire collection database for the highland grasslands in the Atlantic Forest Biome in Brazil. The aim is to evaluate public management tools and legislation evolution during the 35 years of the time series analyzed. The results indicated that 12,285 ha of grasslands were converted to other uses, losing about 24% of their original formation, with 10% occurring after banned this practice in 2008. The burned areas classification using the Random Forest algorithm obtained an AUC = 0.9983. Divergences in the burned area’s extent and frequency were found between the municipality’s authorized license and those classified as burned. On average, only 43% of the burned area in the Parque Estadual do Tainhas and its buffer zone had an environmental permit in the last 5 years. This research’s results provide subsidies for revising and creating public policies and consequently help territorial management. Copyright © 2023 Herrmann, Nascimento, Freitas and Ometto.",,,,
Unexpected electrophiles in the atmosphere - anhydride nucleophile reactions and uptake to biomass burning emissions,"Biomass burning is a significant contributor to atmospheric pollution, its emissions have been found to have adverse impacts on climate and human health. Largely, these impacts are dictated by how the composition of the emissions changes once emitted into the atmosphere. Recently, anhydrides have been identified as a significant fraction of biomass burning emissions, however, little is known about their atmospheric evolution, or their interactions within the burn plume. Without this understanding, it is challenging to predict the impact of anhydrides on biomass burning emissions, and by extension, their influence on climate and health. In this study, we investigate anhydrides as potentially unrecognized electrophiles in the atmosphere. Firstly, by exploring their reactivity towards important biomass burning emitted nucleophiles, and secondly, by measuring their uptake on the emissions themselves. Our results show that phthalic and maleic anhydride can react with a wide range of nucleophiles, including hydroxy and amino-containing compounds, such as levoglucosan or aniline. Additionally, using a coated-wall flow tube setup, we demonstrate that anhydrides reactively uptake to biomass burning films and influence their composition. The anhydride nucleophile reaction was found to be irreversible, proceeding without sunlight or free radicals and indicating it may occur during the day or nighttime. Furthermore, the reaction products were found to be water-stable and contain functional groups which enhance their mass and likely contribute to the formation of secondary organic aerosol, with knock-on climate effects. Overall, our study sheds light on the fundamental chemistry of anhydrides and their potential impacts in the atmosphere. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,,
Offline analysis of secondary formation markers in ambient organic aerosols by liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry,"The present study provides a comprehensive assessment of the quantitative analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with dual orthogonal electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS) of pinene markers, biomass-burning related phenols, and other relevant carboxylic acids in atmospheric aerosol samples. Significant insights into the quantitative determination are offered on the basis of systematic experiments targeting the optimization of chromatographic separation, ionization source, and mass spectrometer performance. After testing three analytical columns, the best separation of the compounds of interest was achieved on a Poroshell 120 EC[sbnd]C18 column (4.6 × 50 mm, 2.7 µm) thermostated at 35 °C, operating in gradient elution mode with 0.1% acetic acid in water and acetonitrile at a 0.8 mL min−1 flow rate. Optimal operational conditions for the ESI-TOF-MS instrument were identified as a 350 °C drying gas temperature, 13 L min−1 drying gas flow rate, 60 psig nebulizer pressure, 3000 V for the ion transfer capillary, 60 V for the skimmer, and 150 V for the fragmentor. Additionally, the matrix effect on the ESI efficiency and the spike recovery factors of the compounds were tested. Method quantification limits can go as low as in the 0.88–48.0 μg L − 1 (3.67–200 pg m − 3, at 120 m3 of sampled air) range. The developed method was shown to be reliable for the quantification of the targeted compounds in real atmospheric aerosol samples. The accuracy in the molecular mass determination of less than 5 ppm and the acquisition in the full scan mode were shown to bring additional insights into the organic constituents in atmospheric aerosols. © 2023",,,,
"Source apportionment of fine particulate matter at a megacity in China, using an improved regularization supervised PMF model","The source apportionment of particulate matter plays an important role in solving the atmospheric particulate pollution. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) is a widely used source apportionment model. At present, high resolution online datasets are increasingly rich, but acquiring accurate and timely source apportionment results is still challenging. Integrating prior knowledge into modelling process is an effective solution and can yield reliable results. This study proposed an improved source apportionment method for the regularization supervised PMF model (RSPMF). This method leveraged actual source profile to guide factor profile for rapidly and automatically identifying source categories and quantifying source contributions. The results showed that the factor profile from RSPMF could be interpreted as seven factors and approach to actual source profile. Average source contributions were also an agreement between RSPMF and EPAPMF, including secondary nitrate (26 %, 27 %), secondary sulfate (23 %, 24 %), coal combustion (18 %, 18 %), vehicle exhaust (15 %, 15 %), biomass burning (10 %, 9 %), dust (5 %, 4 %), industrial emission (3 %, 3 %). The solutions of RSPMF also exhibited good generalizability during different episodes. This study reveals the superiority of supervised model, this model embeds prior knowledge into modelling process to guide model for obtaining more reliable results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
Aqueous-phase chemistry of atmospheric phenolic compounds: A critical review of laboratory studies,"Phenolic compounds (PhCs) are crucial atmospheric pollutants typically emitted by biomass burning and receive particular concerns considering their toxicity, light-absorbing properties, and involvement in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. A comprehensive understanding of the transformation mechanisms on chemical reactions in atmospheric waters (i.e., cloud/fog droplets and aerosol liquid water) is essential to predict more precisely the atmospheric fate and environmental impacts of PhCs. Laboratory studies play a core role in providing the fundamental knowledge of aqueous-phase chemical transformations in the atmosphere. This article critically reviews recent laboratory advances in SOA formation from the aqueous-phase reactions of PhCs. It focuses primarily on the aqueous oxidation of PhCs driven by two atmospheric reactive species: OH radicals and triplet excited state organics, including the important chemical kinetics and mechanisms. The effects of inorganic components (i.e., nitrate and nitrite) and transition metal ions (i.e., soluble iron) are highlighted on the aqueous-phase transformation of PhCs and on the properties and formation mechanisms of SOA. The review is concluded with the current knowledge gaps and future perspectives for a better understanding of the atmospheric transformation and SOA formation potential of PhCs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
"Atmospheric humic-like substances (HULIS) in Chongqing, Southwest China: Abundance, light absorption properties, and potential sources","Atmospheric humic-like substances (HULIS) have a great impact on radiative forcing and atmospheric oxidative capacity due to their efficient light absorption properties. Knowledge on atmospheric HULIS abundance and light absorption properties in southwest China is still very limited. In this study, a total of 81 daily samples of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were collected at two sites in Chongqing during four one-month periods in 2015, each of which representing a typical season. Mass concentrations of HULIS in term of carbon (HULIS-C) were measured by a total organic carbon analyzer, while mass absorption efficiency at 365 nm (MAE365) and absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) were estimated from light absorption of HULIS that was recorded by UV–visible spectrophotometry. The annual mean concentration of HULIS-C was around 3.4 ± 1.6 μg m−3, while the annual mean values of MAE365 and AAE were approximately 2.7 ± 0.7 m2 g−1C and 4.0 ± 0.2, respectively. Seasonal variations were significant for MAE365 but negligible for AAE at both sites. A direct comparison of MAE365 of HULIS in this study with the median MAE365 values from different sources in laboratory studies indicated that crop residues burning and/or wood burning were the primary sources of light-absorbing HULIS, as is also supported by the strong correlation between the light absorption coefficient at 365 nm (Abs365) and K+ (r > 0.85, p < 0.01) throughout the year. Furthermore, the good correlation between Abs365 and secondary organic carbon implied secondary sources also contributed to light-absorbing HULIS (e.g., nitrated aromatic compounds production), as evidenced by the good correlation between Abs365 and NO3− and NH4+. The contribution of primary and secondary sources to light-absorbing HULIS was quantified using a machine learning algorithm, which showed >65% contribution from primary sources during the cold season, but only 35% during the warm seasons. © 2023",,,,
PH dependence of brown-carbon optical properties in cloud water,"Light-Absorbing organic species present in aerosols, collectively called brown carbon (BrC), have important but highly uncertain effects on climate. Clouds likely represent a significant medium for secondary BrC production and for bleaching reactions, though the relative importance of the formation and loss processes in clouds is unknown at present. The acidity (or pH) of atmospheric particles and clouds affects the optical properties of BrC and bleaching rates. Given the wide variability of pH in the atmosphere (pH in particles and clouds ranges from-1 to 8), the optical properties of BrC and its bleaching behavior are expected to vary significantly, and the link between pH and BrC is yet another uncertainty in attempts to constrain its climate forcing effects. In this work, we characterize the pH dependence of BrC optical properties-including light absorption at 365 nm (Abs365), the mass absorption coefficient (MAC365), and the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE)-in bulk cloud water sampled from the summit of Whiteface Mountain, NY. In all samples (nCombining double low line17), Abs365 and MAC365 increased linearly with increasing pH, highlighting the importance of reporting pH in studies of BrC in aqueous media. There was strong variability in the sensitivity of Abs365 to pH, with normalized slopes that ranged from 5.1 % to 17.2 % per pH unit. The normalized slope decreased strongly with increasing cloud water [K+], suggesting that the non-biomass-burning BrC has optical properties that are more sensitive to pH than BrC associated with biomass burning. AAE also showed a distinct pH dependence as it was relatively flat between pH 1.5-5 and then decreased significantly above pH 5. The cloud water composition was used to inform thermodynamic predictions of aerosol pH upwind and/or downwind of Whiteface Mountain and the subsequent changes in BrC optical properties. Overall, these results show that, in addition to secondary BrC production, photobleaching, and the altitudinal distribution, the climate forcing of BrC is quite strongly affected by its pH-dependent absorption.  © Copyright: ",,,,
Quantitative assessment of the impact of biomass burning episodes on surface solar radiation using machine learning technology: A case study of a pollution event in Beijing,"As an important source of pollutants in Beijing, biomass burning (BB) aerosols emitted by BB have a strong absorption and scattering effect on surface solar radiation (SSR). However, the existence of meteorological factors has a powerful impact on the estimation of the BB aerosol radiation effect. In this paper, a deweathered technique based on machine learning is presented to quantitatively isolate the influence of weather conditions from the radiative effect of BB aerosols. Furthermore, the seasonal trend of SSR is constrained by removing the general seasonal changes by the detrending method. The BB event on October 7–11, 2014, in Beijing was used as a case to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that meteorological factors aggravate the influence of BB events on SSR. Specifically, during the BB event, meteorological factors led to an additional increase of 10.9% in diffuse radiation and an additional decrease of 17.5%, 13.1%, 181.3%, 9.7% and 86.9% in global radiation, net radiation, horizontal direct radiation, reflected radiation and vertical direct radiation, respectively. After isolating the impact of meteorological factors on SSR in the BB event, we found that the average effects of BB aerosols on global radiation, net radiation, diffuse radiation, horizontal direct solar radiation, reflected radiation and vertical direct solar radiation during the BB event were −35.6 Wm−2 (−3.1 MJm−2day−1), −14.1 Wm−2 (−1.2 MJm−2day−1), 20.7 Wm−2 (1.8 MJm−2day−1), −67.3 Wm−2 (−5.8 MJm−2day−1), −8.9 Wm−2 (−0.8MJm−2day−1), and −132.9 Wm−2 (−11.5 MJm−2day−1), respectively. In conclusion, the weather normalization and detrended methods in this study provide a new idea for the accurate estimation of the impact of aerosols on SSR. This provides a quantitative reference for further understanding the impacts of atmospheric pollution on SSR. © 2023",,,,
"Variation of Aerosol Optical Properties over Cluj-Napoca, Romania, Based on 10 Years of AERONET Data and MODIS MAIAC AOD Product","Aerosols play an important role in Earth’s climate system, and thus long-time ground- based measurements of aerosol optical properties are useful in understanding this role. Ten years of quality-assured measurements between 2010 and 2020 are used to investigate the aerosol climatology in the Cluj-Napoca area, in North-Western Romania. In this study, we analyze the aerosol optical depth (AOD), single scattering albedo (SSA) and angstrom exponent obtained by the CIMEL sun photometer, part of the aerosol robotic network (AERONET), to extract the seasonality of aerosols in the region and investigate the aerosol climatology of the area. Higher aerosol loads are found during July and August. The angstrom exponent has the lowest values in April and May, and the highest in August. The classification of aerosols using AERONET data is performed to separate dust, biomass burning, polluted urban, marine and continental-dominant aerosol mixtures. In addition, the study presents the validation efforts of the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) dataset against AERONET AOD over a 10-year period. © 2023 by the authors.",,,,
Chemical and dynamical identification of emission outflows during the HALO campaign EMeRGe in Europe and Asia,"The number of large urban agglomerations is steadily increasing worldwide. At a local scale, their emissions lead to air pollution, directly affecting people's health. On a global scale, their emissions lead to an increase of greenhouse gases, affecting climate. In this context, in 2017 and 2018, the airborne campaign EMeRGe (Effect of Megacities on the transport and transformation of pollutants on the Regional to Global scales) investigated emissions of European and Asian major population centres (MPCs) to improve the understanding and predictability of pollution outflows. Here, we present two methods to identify and characterise pollution outflows probed during EMeRGe. First, we use a set of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as chemical tracers to characterise air masses by specific source signals, i.e. benzene from anthropogenic pollution of targeted regions, acetonitrile from biomass burning (BB, primarily during EMeRGe-Asia), and isoprene from fresh biogenic signals (primarily during EMeRGe-Europe. Second, we attribute probed air masses to source regions and estimate their individual contribution by constructing and applying a simple emission uptake scheme for the boundary layer which combines FLEXTRA back trajectories and EDGAR carbon monoxide (CO) emission rates (acronyms are provided in the Appendix). During EMeRGe-Europe, we identified anthropogenic pollution outflows from northern Italy, southern Great Britain, the Belgium-Netherlands-Ruhr (BNR) area and the Iberian Peninsula. Additionally, our uptake scheme indicates significant long-range transport of pollution from the USA and Canada. During EMeRGe-Asia, the pollution outflow is dominated by sources in China and Taiwan, but BB signals from Southeast Asia and India contribute as well. Outflows of pre-selected MPC targets are identified in less than 20g% of the sampling time, due to restrictions in flight planning and constraints of the measurement platform itself. Still, EMeRGe combines in a unique way near- and far-field measurements, which show signatures of local and distant sources, transport and conversion fingerprints, and complex air mass compositions. Our approach provides a valuable classification and characterisation of the EMeRGe dataset, e.g. for BB and anthropogenic influence of potential source regions and paves the way for a more comprehensive analysis and various model studies.  © Author(s) 2023.

Using machine learning to quantify sources of light-absorbing water-soluble humic-like substances (HULISws) in Northeast China,"Water-soluble humic-like substances (HULISws) are a group of heterogeneous organic compounds in the atmosphere, greatly impacting climate change and human health. As the most significant biomass burning (BB) and fossil fuel burning polluted area in China, Northeast China Plain could generate more light absorbing HULISws to the atmosphere. In this work, daily fine particle (PM2.5) samples were collected in Changchun, located in Northeast China Plain, from October 17th to November 29th, 2016, to investigate the potential sources of optical properties of HULISws. Here, the whole sampling period was divided into three sub-periods using the density of fire spots and the timeline of the central heating: the non-heating (October 17th to October 24th), early heating (October 25th to November 13th), and normal heating (November 14th to November 29th) periods. The mean mass concentrations of HULISws were 4.2 ± 1.2, 8.6 ± 3.6, and 2.4 ± 1.3 μg m−3 during the non-heating, early heating, and normal heating periods, respectively. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model results suggested that the contribution of primary BB, secondary BB, and fossil fuel burning emissions were 46%, 24%, and 19% during the non-heating period, 22%, 29%, and 17% during the early heating period, and 13%, 16%, and 50% during the normal heating period, respectively. Combining the PMF results with the random forest (RF) algorithm, the contribution of each source to the optical properties was quantified. Here, BB still dominated the optical properties of HULISws in Northeast China. During the study period, the primary BB and secondary BB contributed 25% and 34% in the light absorption coefficient (Abs), 22% and 33% in the mass absorption exponent (MAE), and 17% and 33% in the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), respectively. Other sources like cooking and fossil combustion contributed 25% and 35% in Abs, 35% and 26% in MAE, and 16% and 33% in AAE, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures on nitrogen dioxide and black carbon concentrations close to a major Italian motorway,"During the first half of 2020, the Italian government imposed several restrictions to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic: at the beginning of March, a heavy lockdown regime was introduced leading to a drastic reduction of traffic and, consequently, traffic-related emissions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of these restrictions on pollutant concentrations close to a stretch of the Italian A22 motorway lying in the Alpine Adige valley. In particular, the analysis focuses on measured concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and black carbon (BC). Results show that, close to the motorway, NO2 concentrations dropped by around 45% during the lockdown period with respect to the same time period of the previous 3 years. The equivalent analysis for BC shows that the component related to biomass burning, mostly due to domestic heating, was not particularly affected by the restrictions, while the BC component related to fossil fuels, directly connected to traffic, plummeted by almost 60% with respect to the previous years. Since atmospheric concentrations of pollutants depend both on emissions and meteorological conditions, which can mask the variations in the emission regime, a random forest algorithm is also applied to the measured concentrations, in order to better evaluate the effects of the restrictions on emissions. This procedure allows for obtaining business-as-usual and meteorologically normalized time series of both NO2 and BC concentrations. The results derived from the random forest algorithm clearly confirm the drop in NO2 emissions at the beginning of the lockdown period, followed by a slow and partial recovery in the following months. They also confirm that, during the lockdown, emissions of the BC component due to biomass burning were not significantly affected, while those of the BC component related to fossil fuels underwent an abrupt drop. © 2023 The Authors.

"Development of current and future high-resolution gridded emission inventory of anthropogenic air pollutants for urban air quality studies in Hanoi, Vietnam","A high-resolution (1 km × 1 km) emission inventory was developed for Hanoi for 2017 and 2018. The total annual emissions of PM2.5, BC, OC, NOx, SO2, NMVOC, NH3, CH4, and CO were 14.9, 1.6, 2.9, 56.7, 19.1, 109.2, 23.0, 37.9, and 472.7 Gg, respectively. Transportation, industry, and agriculture contributed 89.1%, 92.2%, and 81.3% to the total emissions of PM2.5, BC, and OC, respectively. Transportation contributed 72.4%, 52.1%, and 72.5% to the emissions of NOx, NMVOC, and CO, respectively. Industry contributed 64.9% to the emissions of SO2. Agriculture was a major source of NH3 and CH4, contributing 84.2% and 76.6%, respectively. Future emissions of select sectors were estimated for 2030. The emissions from transportation can increase in the range of 26.9% (CH4) to 245.8% (NH3), despite the consideration of the EURO 5 standard. For domestic cooking, transitioning from coal to liquefied petroleum gas can help reduce the emissions of most pollutants in the range of 10.4% (NH3) to 52.6% (OC), except NOx and NMVOC. The crop residue burning (CRB) ban could reduce emissions in the range of 0.27 Gg (SO2) to 138.4 Gg (CO) in 2030, respectively. The study can help policy-makers to develop strategies for air pollution mitigation in developing economies such as Hanoi. © 2022",,,,
Diffusion Coefficients and Mixing Times of Organic Molecules in β-Caryophyllene Secondary Organic Aerosol (SOA) and Biomass Burning Organic Aerosol (BBOA),"Information on the diffusion rates of organic molecules within secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) is needed to predict the impact of these aerosols on atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and climate. Nevertheless, no studies have measured diffusion rates of organics within SOA generated from β-caryophyllene or within BBOA. Here, we measured diffusion rates of organic molecules in laboratory-generated SOA and BBOA as a function of water activity (aw) using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The SOA was generated by the ozonolysis of β-caryophyllene, and the BBOA was generated by the pyrolysis of pine wood. Only the water-soluble component of the BBOA was studied. The measured diffusion coefficients of organic molecules in β-caryophyllene range from 1.1 × 10-16 to 1.3 × 10-14 m2 s-1 for aw values ranging from 0.23 to 0.86. For BBOA, the diffusion coefficients range from 7.3 × 10-17 to 6.6 × 10-16 m2 s-1 for aw values ranging from 0.23 to 0.43. Based on these values, the mixing times of organic molecules within a 200 nm SOA or BBOA are less than 1 min for aw values >0.23. Since aw values are often greater than 0.23 in the planetary boundary layer and temperatures in the planetary boundary are often within 5 K of our experimental temperatures, mixing times are likely often short in that part of the atmosphere for the types of aerosols studied here. For β-caryophyllene SOA, we compared the measured diffusion coefficients with predictions based on the Stokes-Einstein relation and the fractional Stokes-Einstein relation. For both the Stokes-Einstein and the fractional Stokes-Einstein relations, the measured diffusion coefficients agree with the predicted diffusion coefficients. This work illustrates that when the radius of the diffusing molecules is greater than the average radius of the matrix molecules, the Stokes-Einstein equation is able to predict diffusion coefficients in β-caryophyllene SOA with reasonable accuracy.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,,,
"Differential effects of the covid-19 lockdown and regional fire on the air quality of medellín, colombia","Governments’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic provide a unique opportunity to study the effects of restricted socioeconomic activity on air quality. Here, we study the changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown in Medellín and its metropolitan area, Colombia, for periods with and without enhanced regional fire activity, considering the effects of meteorology using random forest and multiple linear regression methods. The lockdown measures, which reduced mean traffic volume by 70% compared to 2016–2019, resulted in reductions for PM2.5 (50–63%), PM10 (59–64%), NO (75–76%), NO2 (43–47%), and CO (40–47%), while O3 concentration increased by 19–22%. In contrast, when fire activity was high, the effects of the lockdown on air quality were shadowed by the long-range transport of biomass burning emissions, increasing fine particulate matter and ozone. This study shows that healthier levels are achievable through significant efforts from decision-makers and society. The results highlight the need to develop integral measures that do not only consider reductions in the local emissions from transportation and industry, but also the role of fire activity in the region, as well as the difficulties of achieving reductions in ozone from measures that are effective at reducing primary pollutants. © 2021 by the authors.

"Aerosols over East and South Asia: Type Identification, Optical Properties, and Implications for Radiative Forcing","Identification of aerosol types has long been a difficult problem over East and South Asia due to various limitations. In this study, we use 2-dimensional (2-D) and multi-dimensional Mahalanobis distance (MD) clustering algorithms to identify aerosol characteristics based on the data from the Aerosol Robotic Network from March 1998 to February 2018 over the South and East Asian region (10◦ N~50◦ N, 70◦ E~135◦ E). The single scattering albedo (SSA), absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE), extinction Angstrom exponent (EAE), real index of refraction (RRI), and imaginary index of refraction (IRI) are utilized for classification of aerosols. Sub-regions with similar background conditions over East and South Asia are identified by hierarchical clustering algorithm to illustrate distinctive meteorological states in different areas. The East and South Asian aerosols are found to have distinct regional and seasonal features relating to the meteorological conditions, land cover, and industrial infrastructure. It is found that the proportions of dust aerosol are the highest in spring at the SACOL site and in summer at the sites near the Northern Indo-Gangetic Plain area. In spring, biomass-burning aerosols are dominant over the central Indo-China Peninsula area. The aerosol characteristics at coastal sites are also analyzed and compared with previous results. The 2-D clustering method is useful when limited aerosol parameters are available, but the results are highly dependent on the sets of parameters used for identification. Comparatively, the MD method, which considers multiple aerosol parameters, could provide more comprehensive classification of aerosol types. It is estimated that only about 50% of the data samples that are identifiable by the MD method could be classified by the 2-D methods, and a lot of undetermined data samples could be mis-classified by the 2-D methods. The aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) and the aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) of various aerosol types at the top and the bottom of the atmosphere (TOA and BOA) are determined based on the MD aerosol classification. The dust aerosols are found to have the largest ARF at the TOA (−36 W/m2 ), followed by the urban/industrial aerosols and biomass-burning aerosols. The ARFE of biomass-burning aerosols at the BOA (−165 W/m2 /AOD550nm ) is the strongest among those of the other aerosol types. The comparison of the results by MD and 2-D methods shows that the differences in ARF and ARFE are generally within 10%. Our results indicate the importance of aerosol type classification in accurately attributing the radiative contributions of different aerosol components. © 2022 by the authors.

An aerosol classification scheme for global simulations using the K-means machine learning method,"The K-means machine learning algorithm is applied to climatological data of seven aerosol properties from a global aerosol simulation using EMAC-MADE3. The aim is to partition the aerosol properties across the global atmosphere in specific aerosol regimes; this is done mainly for evaluation purposes. K-means is an unsupervised machine learning method with the advantage that an a priori definition of the aerosol classes is not required. Using K-means, we are able to quantitatively define global aerosol regimes, so-called aerosol clusters, and explain their internal properties and their location and extension. This analysis shows that aerosol regimes in the lower troposphere are strongly influenced by emissions. Key drivers of the clusters' internal properties and spatial distribution are, for instance, pollutants from biomass burning and biogenic sources, mineral dust, anthropogenic pollution, and corresponding mixtures. Several continental clusters propagate into oceanic regions as a result of long-range transport of air masses. The identified oceanic regimes show a higher degree of pollution in the Northern Hemisphere than over the southern oceans. With increasing altitude, the aerosol regimes propagate from emission-induced clusters in the lower troposphere to roughly zonally distributed regimes in the middle troposphere and in the tropopause region. Notably, three polluted clusters identified over Africa, India, and eastern China cover the whole atmospheric column from the lower troposphere to the tropopause region. The results of this analysis need to be interpreted taking the limitations and strengths of global aerosol models into consideration. On the one hand, global aerosol simulations cannot estimate small-scale and localized processes due to the coarse resolution. On the other hand, they capture the spatial pattern of aerosol properties on the global scale, implying that the clustering results could provide useful insights for aerosol research. To estimate the uncertainties inherent in the applied clustering method, two sensitivity tests have been conducted (i) to investigate how various data scaling procedures could affect the K-means classification and (ii) to compare K-means with another unsupervised classification algorithm (HAC, i.e. hierarchical agglomerative clustering). The results show that the standardization based on sample mean and standard deviation is the most appropriate standardization method for this study, as it keeps the underlying distribution of the raw data set and retains the information of outliers. The two clustering algorithms provide similar classification results, supporting the robustness of our conclusions. The classification procedures presented in this study have a markedly wide application potential for future model-based aerosol studies. © Copyright: ",,,,
Ground-based investigation of HOxand ozone chemistry in biomass burning plumes in rural Idaho,"Ozone (O3), a potent greenhouse gas that is detrimental to human health, is typically found in elevated concentrations within biomass burning (BB) smoke plumes. The radical species OH, HO2, and RO2 (known collectively as ROx) have central roles in the formation of secondary pollutants including O3 but are poorly characterized for BB plumes. We present measurements of total peroxy radical concentrations ([XO2]¯[HO2]+[RO2]) and additional trace-gas and particulate matter measurements from McCall, Idaho, during August 2018. There were five distinct periods in which BB smoke impacted this site. During BB events, O3 concentrations were enhanced, evident by ozone enhancement ratios (δO3/δCO) that ranged up to 0.06ppbvppbv-1. [XO2] was similarly elevated during some BB events. Overall, instantaneous ozone production rates (P(O3)) were minimally impacted by the presence of smoke as [NOx] enhancements were minimal. Measured XO2 concentrations were compared to zero-dimensional box modeling results to evaluate the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) and GEOS-Chem mechanisms overall and during periods of BB influence. The models consistently overestimated XO2 with the base MCM and GEOS-Chem XO2 predictions high by an average of 28% and 20%, respectively. One period of BB influence had distinct measured enhancements of 15pptv XO2 that were not reflected in the model output, likely due to the presence of unmeasured HOx sources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BB study featuring peroxy radical measurements. © 2022 Andrew J. Lindsay et al.",,,,
"Fuel consumption rates in resprouting eucalypt forest during hazard reduction burns, cultural burns and wildfires","Accurate estimation of emissions from biomass burning and their impact on carbon storage requires pre and post-fire plot measurement of fuel consumption across a range of forest types and fire severities, and this information is currently far from comprehensive in Australia or elsewhere. We measured fine and coarse fuels in 44 sites before and after 20 fires including cultural burns, hazard reduction burns and wildfires in resprouting dry sclerophyll (eucalypt) forests in the Sydney region of Australia. We compared consumption among the classes of fire severity and fire types. Most of the fires removed the great majority of fine litter and near surface fuels (mean 68% and 94% respectively) but a smaller and more variable percentage of other fine components and coarse fuels. Consumption was largely a function of pre-fire fuel levels. However, percentage consumption varied according to fire severity. Remaining fuel was negatively, and fresh fuel (i.e. immediate post-fire inputs) positively related to fire severity so that the two were in balance for litter, twigs and coarse woody debris. A higher proportion of twigs and coarse woody debris were consumed in hazard reduction and wildfires than in cultural burns, and more canopy and tree wood was consumed in wildfire than the other fire types. Total fuel consumption was 12.8 t ha−1 (13% of pre-fire) in cultural burns, 75.7 t ha−1 (27%) in hazard reductions, and 123.5 t ha−1 (38%) in wildfires. This was dominated by tree biomass consumption (69% of total). Our estimates for hazard reduction burns are higher than most previous studies from Australian forests, probably because our fires spanned a greater range of severities. Our study provides a benchmark for estimating fire emissions and carbon dynamics for the region and will contribute to improving predictions of the impact of hazard reduction burns on fire behaviour and smoke emissions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
A remote sensing based study of tropospheric ozone concentration amid COVID-19 lockdown over India using Sentinel-5P satellite data,"Amid the COVID-19 crisis, governments all over the world, and not excluding India, took to lockdown measures to deaccelerate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. This led to reduction of atmospheric pollution by declining the harmful Nitrogen and Sulphur Oxide (NOX and SOX) concentrations. However, one hand while the stratospheric Ozone (O3) showed repair, the lower atmospheric O3 concentrations demonstrated a remarkable increase during lockdown phase over India. This study aims to estimate the O3 concentration during the Covid-19 lockdown over Pune city in India using freely available Sentinel-5P satellite datasets. The study makes use of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Random Forest (RF) regressions and compares the findings of the two algorithms based on estimation results. This study utilizes lower atmospheric O3 concentration data from Sentinel-5P satellite of the European Space Agency (ESA) over the Indian mainland for a month of lockdown scenario (March 22nd, 2020, to April 25th, 2020) and shows the remarkable increase in concentration of O3 gas as a pollutant. Despite the complete lockdown over India during this given time frame, there has been enough emission of O3 precursors from other sources such as stubble burning. The estimates of tropospheric O3 concentration for May 2020 for Pune city, using OLS and RF Regressions, have been validated with May 2020 data. The results have provided a RMSE of 1.05 and 1.23 with R2-statistics of 0.90 and 0.857 in training and testing phases for OLS and RMSE of 0.98 and MAE of 1.07 with R2-statistics of 0.968 and 0.895 in training and testing phases of the RF. The outcome of this study has proven that O3 gas concentrations in the atmosphere depends upon various other causative factors apart from the precursor gases. The study also shows that the remotely sensed Sentinel-5P datasets, supplemented with ground-based sensor data can help in time and cost saving estimation of O3 concentrations in the troposphere with considerable accuracy. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,,
Deep Neural Networks for Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval,"Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a measure of the extinction of solar radiation by aerosols in the atmosphere. Understanding the variations of global AOD is necessary for precisely determining the role of aerosols. Arctic warming is partially caused by aerosols transported from vast distances, including those released during biomass burning events (BBEs). However, measuring AODs is challenging, typically requiring active LIDAR systems or passive sun photometers. Both are limited to cloud-free conditions; sun photometers provide only point measurements, thus requiring more spatial coverage. A more viable method to obtain accurate AOD may be found through machine learning. This study uses DNNs to estimate Svalbard’s AODs using a minimal set of meteorological parameters (temperature, air mass, water vapor, wind speed, latitude, longitude, and time of year). The mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and true data was 0.00401 for the entire set and 0.0079 for the validation set. It was then shown that the inclusion of BBE data improves predictions by 42.167%. It was demonstrated that AODs may be accurately estimated without the use of expensive instrumentation, using machine learning and minimal data. Similar models may be developed for other regions, allowing immediate improvement of current meteorological models. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,,,
The ozone-climate penalty over South America and Africa by 2100,"Climate change has the potential to increase surface ozone (O3) concentrations, known as the ""ozone-climate penalty"", through changes to atmospheric chemistry, transport and dry deposition. In the tropics, the response of surface O3 to changing climate is relatively understudied but has important consequences for air pollution and human and ecosystem health. In this study, we evaluate the change in surface O3 due to climate change over South America and Africa using three state-of-the-art Earth system models that follow the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3-7.0 emission scenario from CMIP6. In order to quantify changes due to climate change alone, we evaluate the difference between simulations including climate change and simulations with a fixed present-day climate. We find that by 2100, models predict an ozone-climate penalty in areas where O3 is already predicted to be high due to the impacts of precursor emissions, namely urban and biomass burning areas, although on average, models predict a decrease in surface O3 due to climate change. We identify a small but robust positive trend in annual mean surface O3 over polluted areas. Additionally, during biomass burning seasons, seasonal mean O3 concentrations increase by 15 ppb (model range 12 to 18 ppb) in areas with substantial biomass burning such as the arc of deforestation in the Amazon. The ozone-climate penalty in polluted areas is shown to be driven by an increased rate of O3 chemical production, which is strongly influenced by NOx concentrations and is therefore specific to the emission pathway chosen. Multiple linear regression finds the change in NOx concentration to be a strong predictor of the change in O3 production, whereas increased isoprene emission rate is positively correlated with increased O3 destruction, suggesting NOx-limited conditions over the majority of tropical Africa and South America. However, models disagree on the role of climate change in remote, low-NOx regions, partly because of significant differences in NOx concentrations produced by each model. We also find that the magnitude and location of the ozone-climate penalty in the Congo Basin has greater inter-model variation than that in the Amazon, so further model development and validation are needed to constrain the response in central Africa. We conclude that if the climate were to change according to the emission scenario used here, models predict that forested areas in biomass burning locations and urban populations will be at increasing risk of high O3 exposure, irrespective of any direct impacts on O3 via the prescribed emission scenario.

Reconstructing burnt area during the Holocene: an Iberian case study,"Charcoal accumulated in lake, bog or other anoxic sediments through time has been used to document the geographical patterns in changes in fire regimes. Such reconstructions are useful to explore the impact of climate and vegetation changes on fire during periods when human influence was less prevalent than today. However, charcoal records only provide semi-quantitative estimates of change in biomass burning. Here we derive quantitative estimates of burnt area from vegetation data in two stages. First, we relate the modern charcoal abundance to burnt area using a conversion factor derived from a generalised linear model of burnt area probability based on eight environmental predictors. Then, we establish the relationship between fossil pollen assemblages and burnt area using tolerance-weighted weighted averaging partial least-squares regression with a sampling frequency correction (fxTWA-PLS). We test this approach using the Iberian Peninsula as a case study because it is a fire-prone region with abundant pollen and charcoal records covering the Holocene. We derive the vegetation-burnt area relationship using the 31 records that have both modern and fossil charcoal and pollen data and then reconstruct palaeoburnt area for the 113 records with Holocene pollen records. The pollen data predict charcoal-derived burnt area relatively well (R2 0.44), and the changes in reconstructed burnt area are synchronous with known climate changes through the Holocene. This new method opens up the possibility of reconstructing changes in fire regimes quantitatively from pollen records, after regional calibration of the vegetation-burnt area relationship, in regions where pollen records are more abundant than charcoal records. © 2022 Yicheng Shen et al.",,,,
Fermentation of palm oil mill effluent in the presence of lysinibacillus sp. LC 556247 to produce alternative biomass fuel,"A bacterial strain, identified as Lysinibacillus sp. LC 556247 POME, was isolated from palm oil mill effluent (POME). The present article highlights the potential utilization of POME as a sole fermentation medium by Lysinibacillus sp. LC 556247 to produce biomass fuel via aerobic fermentation. The fermentation was performed in a shake flask with a working volume of 300 mL, agitated at 180 rpm, incubated at 35 ± 2 °C for various fermentation hours, ranging from 1, 2, 3, 4, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h, and was followed by a drying process. Elucidation of the POME characteristics, calorific energy values (CEV), moisture content (MC), oil and grease content, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO), total suspended solids (TSS), pH, total nitrogen, and the colony-forming unit (CFU) were performed. The results demonstrate that the highest CEV, of 21.25 ± 0.19 MJ/kg, was obtained at 48 h fermentation. High amounts of extractable oil and nitrogen content were retrieved at the highest CEV reading of the fermented and dried POME samples, which were 17.95 ± 0.02% and 12.80 ± 0.08%, respectively. The maximum removal efficiencies for the COD (50.83%), the BOD (71.73%), and the TSS (42.99%) were achieved at 120 h of fermentation, with an operating pH ranging from 4.49-4.54. The XRF analysis reveals that the fermented and dried products consisted of elements that had a high amount of carbon and potassium, and a significantly low amount of silica, which is sufficient for the effective burning of biomass fuel in the boiler. © 2021 by the authors.",,,,
Hybrid draft direct-combustion with secondary air jets in cross-flow for reducing CO and PM2.5 emissions in biomass cookstoves,"CO and PM2.5 emissions in household biomass cook stoves are affecting billions of lives and millions are suffering from related fatal diseases. An air supply configuration was proposed and tested experimentally to reduce emissions from a prototype biomass cook stove. The hybrid draft staged combustion with primary air by natural draft and preheated secondary air by forced draft was tested in a wood-burning cook stove. The secondary air jets were arranged in cross-flow to the primary flue. A mathematical model to predict the performance of a hybrid draft cook stove was developed and validated experimentally. The effect of different parameters such as excess air ratio (λ), Primary air to secondary air ratio (PA/SA) and Momentum flux ratio (J) was investigated. All three variables have shown a profound effect on CO and PM2.5 emissions. Optimum values of these parameters for minimum CO emissions were identified as λ = 3, PA/SA = 1.9 and J = 94 respectively. However, the mechanism of CO and PM2.5 destruction was found to be different and no such optimum was identified for PM2.5 emissions. The hybrid draft configuration resulted in a significant reduction of CO and PM2.5 emissions, achieving emissions performance corresponding to the Tier 4 level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
"Optical and Microphysical Properties of the Aerosol Field over Sofia, Bulgaria, Based on AERONET Sun-Photometer Measurements","An analysis of the optical and microphysical characteristics of aerosol passages over Sofia City, Bulgaria, was performed on the basis of data provided by the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). The data considered are the result of two nearly complete annual cycles of passive optical remote sensing of the atmosphere above the Sofia Site using a Cimel CE318-TS9 sun/sky/lunar photometer functioning since 5 May 2020. The values of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and the Ångström Exponent (AE) measured during each annual cycle and the overall two-year cycle exhibited similar statistics. The two-year mean AODs were 0.20 (±0.11) and 0.17 (±0.10) at the wavelengths of 440 nm (AOD440) and 500 nm, respectively. The two-year mean AEs at the wavelength pairs 440/870 nm (AE440/870) and 380/500 nm were 1.45 (±0.35) and 1.32 (±0.29). The AOD values obtained reach maxima in winter-to-spring and summer and were about two times smaller than those obtained 15 years ago using a hand-held Microtops II sun photometer. The AOD440 and AE440/870 frequency distributions outline two AOD and three AE modes, i.e., 3 × 2 groups of aerosol events identifiable using AOD–AE-based aerosol classifications, additional aerosol characteristics, and aerosol migration models. The aerosol load over the city was estimated to consist most frequently of urban (63.4%) aerosols. The relative occurrences of desert dust, biomass-burning aerosols, and mixed aerosols were, respectively, 8.0%, 9.1% and 19.5%. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,,,
Quantifying the Influence of a Burn Event on Ammonia Concentrations Using a Machine-Learning Technique,"Although combustion is considered a common source of ammonia (NH3) in the atmo-sphere, field measurements quantifying such emissions of NH3 are still lacking. In this study, online measurements of NH3 were performed by a cavity ring-down spectrometer, in the cold season at a rural site in Xianghe on the North China Plain. We found that the NH3 concentrations were mostly below 65 ppb during the study period. However, from 18 to 21 November 2017, a close burn event (~100 m) increased the NH3 concentrations to 145.6 ± 139.9 ppb. Using a machine-learning technique, we quantified that this burn event caused a significant increase in NH3 concentrations by 411%, compared with the scenario without the burn event. In addition, the ratio of ∆NH3 /∆CO during the burn period was 0.016, which fell in the range of biomass burning. Future investigations are needed to evaluate the impacts of the NH3 combustion sources on air quality, ecosystems, and climate in the context of increasing burn events worldwide. © 2022 by the authors.

Sea Salt Aerosol Identification Based on Multispectral Optical Properties and Its Impact on Radiative Forcing over the Ocean,"The ground-based measurement of sea salt (SS) aerosol over the ocean requires the massive utilization of satellite-derived aerosol products. In this study, n-order spectral derivatives of aerosol optical depth (AOD) based on wavelength were examined to characterize SS and other aerosol types in terms of their spectral dependence related to their optical properties such as particle size distributions and complex refractive indices. Based on theoretical simulations from the second simulation of a satellite signal in the solar spectrum (6S) model, AOD spectral derivatives of SS were characterized along with other major types including mineral dust (DS), biomass burning (BB), and anthropogenic pollutants (APs). The approach (normalized derivative aerosol index, NDAI) of partitioning aerosol types with intrinsic values of particle size distribution and complex refractive index from normalized first-and second-order derivatives was applied to the datasets from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) as well as by the ground-based aerosol robotic network (AERONET). The results after implementation from multiple sources of data indicated that the proposed approach could be highly effective for identifying and segregating abundant SS from DS, BB, and AP, across an ocean. Consequently, each aerosol’s shortwave radiative forcing and its efficiency could be further estimated in order to predict its impact on the climate. © 2022 by the authors.

"Compositions, source apportionment and health risks assessment of fine particulate matter in naturally-ventilated schools","Good indoor air quality in school environment is crucial for teaching and learning processes, as well as student development. This study aims to identify the composition of PM2.5 and the main sources of it which influence the indoor and outdoor school environment. The PM2.5 sampling was conducted using a portable low volume air sampler and took place at three different primary schools. The chemical composition of PM2.5 is comprised of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) and potentially toxic trace metals. WSII (Cl−, NO3−, SO42−, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) were analysed using ion chromatography (IC) and trace metals concentrations (Al, Fe, Zn, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Ni, As, Co, Cd) using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that the highest average for PM2.5 concentrations in an indoor classroom was recorded at the school located in the industrial area (23.5 μg/m3) followed by urban (18.6 μg/m3) and suburban (9.58 μg/m3). The indoor to outdoor (I/O) ratio values for PM2.5 concentrations were slightly above one, indicating that open doors and windows highly affected indoor PM2.5 concentrations. Source apportionment analysis indicated that the sources of both indoor and outdoor PM2.5 were mixed of natural (crustal, mineral dust and sea salt) and anthropogenic (vehicle, industrial and biomass burning). The hazard quotient (HQ) value was lower than the acceptable limits. The excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) value for all three stations, however, was found to be slightly higher than the acceptable level (1.0E-06) for Cr and Ni. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",,,,
Identification and spatiotemporal distribution analysis of global biomass burning based on Suomi-NPP VIIRS Nightfire data,"Biomass burning refers to the combustion of various organisms formed through photosynthesis, including natural and man-made biomass burning. Biomass combustion has great impacts on nature and human health. Biomass combustion and industrial heat sources overlap in temperature range, it is difficult to distinguish them with traditional methods. In order to explore the distribution of biomass combustion, the influence of industrial heat sources must be eliminated. This paper used Suomi-NPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) Nightfire data to extract 1,457,930 global biomass combustion objects from 2012 to 2018 based on the spatial distribution, occurrence frequency and duration characteristics of biomass combustion. The extracted results were verified using industrial directory Point of Interest (POI) data obtained online from high-resolution remote sensing images and place name maps, and the results showed that 98.37% of the industrial heat sources were successfully removed. The spatial and temporal characteristics of biomass combustion in regions with varying levels of economic development at the intercontinental, international and global levels from 2012 to 2018 were revealed in this paper. It also compares the temporal and spatial differences in biomass burning among different climate zones and land cover types from 2012 to 2018. Overall, global biomass burning showed an upward trend from 2012 to 2018 and increased significantly from 2015 to 2016. Global biomass combustion was mostly distributed in Africa, followed by Oceania and South America. Australia, Brazil, Russia, the United States and Canada were the five countries with the most biomass burning. The proportions of biomass burning in different climatic zones and land cover types also showed obvious regularity. Biomass combustion mostly occurred in low-latitude and high-temperature areas and in areas where the land cover types included shrublands, grasslands and farmlands. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Development of aerosol optical properties for improving the MESSy photolysis module in the GEM-MACH v2.4 air quality model and application for calculating photolysis rates in a biomass burning plume,"The photolysis module in Environment and Climate Change Canada's online chemical transport model GEM-MACH (GEM: Global Environmental Multi-scale - MACH: Modelling Air quality and Chemistry) was improved to make use of the online size and composition-resolved representation of atmospheric aerosols and relative humidity in GEM-MACH, to account for aerosol attenuation of radiation in the photolysis calculation. We coupled both the GEM-MACH aerosol module and the MESSy-JVAL (Modular Earth Submodel System) photolysis module, through the use of the online aerosol modeled data and a new Mie lookup table for the model-generated extinction efficiency, absorption and scattering cross sections of each aerosol type. The new algorithm applies a lensing correction factor to the black carbon absorption efficiency (core-shell parameterization) and calculates the scattering and absorption optical depth and asymmetry factor of black carbon, sea salt, dust and other internally mixed components. We carried out a series of simulations with the improved version of MESSy-JVAL and wildfire emission inputs from the Canadian Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System (CFFEPS) for 2 months, compared the model aerosol optical depth (AOD) output to the previous version of MESSy-JVAL, satellite data, ground-based measurements and reanalysis products, and evaluated the effects of AOD calculations and the interactive aerosol feedback on the performance of the GEM-MACH model. The comparison of the improved version of MESSy-JVAL with the previous version showed significant improvements in the model performance with the implementation of the new photolysis module and with adopting the online interactive aerosol concentrations in GEM-MACH. Incorporating these changes to the model resulted in an increase in the correlation coefficient from 0.17 to 0.37 between the GEM-MACH model AOD 1-month hourly output and AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) measurements across all the North American sites. Comparisons of the updated model AOD with AERONET measurements for selected Canadian urban and industrial sites, specifically, showed better correlation coefficients for urban AERONET sites and for stations located further south in the domain for both simulation periods (June and January 2018). The predicted monthly averaged AOD using the improved photolysis module followed the spatial patterns of MERRA-2 reanalysis (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications - version 2), with an overall underprediction of AOD over the common domain for both seasons. Our study also suggests that the domain-wide impacts of direct and indirect effect aerosol feedbacks on the photolysis rates from meteorological changes are considerably greater (3 to 4 times) than the direct aerosol optical effect on the photolysis rate calculations. © 2022 Copernicus GmbH.

Novel Application of Machine Learning Techniques for Rapid Source Apportionment of Aerosol Mass Spectrometer Datasets,"We apply machine learning approaches sparse multinomial logistic regression to classify aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) unit mass resolution (UMR) data followed by an ensemble regression technique for source apportionment of organic aerosols (OA). The classifier was trained on 60 well characterized laboratory and positive matrix factorization (PMF) deconvolved reference spectra to identify eight OA types. These include four laboratory-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) spectra, which include isoprene photooxidation SOA, isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) SOA, a monoterpene SOA type that includes α-pinene and β-pinene SOA, and aromatic SOA from oxidation of naphthalene and m-xylene precursors, as well as PMF deconvolved spectra for three primary organic aerosol (POA) types, namely, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA), biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA), and cooking OA (COA), and a more oxidized oxygenated OA type (MO-OOA). A 5-fold cross-validation strategy, repeated 10 times, was used to assess the classifier's performance. The classifier had high classification accuracy for COA, aromatic SOA, and isoprene SOA spectra but incorrectly classified ∼9% by number of MO-OOA spectra as BBOA, 12% of BBOA spectra as HOA (and vice versa), and 18% of IEPOX-SOA spectra as aromatic SOA. Next, an ensemble regression model was trained on an artificially generated dataset consisting of mixtures of different OA types to assess its ability to predict fractional mass abundances from classification probabilities of various OA species obtained from the multinomial logistic regression classifier trained on the reference spectra. Ultimately, the proposed approach was applied for source apportionment of aircraft-based AMS measurements of OA UMR spectra during the HI-SCALE field campaign. On two representative days (May 6th and 18th, 2016), the algorithm determined that ∼50-60% of OA by mass was MO-OOA, which represented a highly aged organic aerosol mixture from different sources. On both days, BBOA was determined to contribute less than 10% to OA by mass. However, on May 18th, the aromatic SOA fraction was higher compared to that on May 6th. The proposed approach is capable of rapidly analyzing AMS data in real time, making it suitable for applications where rapid source apportionment of AMS OA spectra is desirable. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Accounting Carbon Footprints and Applying Data Envelopment Analysis to Optimize Input-Induced Greenhouse Gas Emissions Under Rice–Wheat Cropping System in North-Western India,"The quantification of carbon (C) footprints in crop production is important to underpin the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation options. The present study aims at accounting C footprints of high-input intensive rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system in north-western India, and the optimization of the amount of input-induced carbon equivalent (CE) emissions that could be reduced at a current level of economic output. We quantified the C footprints related to different agri-inputs and agri-machinery employed for different farm operations based on life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The data were collected for 80 farms (40 each under rice and wheat cultivation), which were used to estimate CE emissions based on specific emission coefficients. This study quantified the CE emissions and the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestered in soils to estimate GHG mitigation potential of a rice–wheat cropping system. We employed slack-based measure (SBM) data envelopment analysis (DEA) to elucidate the efficient and inefficient farms (i.e., decision-making units (DMUs)) under rice–wheat cropping system. A multiple linear regression output predictive model was used to predict and compare the predicted vs. actually measured crop yield. The input-induced total CE emissions (CET) in rice, wheat, and rice–wheat cropping system were 2438.3 ± 73.5, 1682.1 ± 33.1, and 4120.2 ± 88.6 kg CO2e ha−1, respectively. Of these emissions, the amount of CO2 sequestered in soils under rice, wheat, and rice–wheat cropping system comprised ~ 10.0%, 8.0%, and 9.2%, respectively. Fertilizer-N, fertilizer-P2O5, and fertilizer-K2O application accounted for 95–98%, 1.6–5.1%, and 0.3–0.8% of total fertilizer-related carbon equivalent emission (CEF). About 71% of CE emissions related to electricity consumption (CEE) in the rice–wheat system were ascribed to irrigation in rice cultivation. The SBM-DEA approach elucidated 24 DMUs (60% of total DMUs) under rice and 18 DMUs (45% of total DMUs) under wheat cultivation as efficient with technical efficiency (TE) score = 1.00. On average, inefficient rice and wheat DMUs respectively had ~ 18.3% and 7.6% higher CE T than the efficient DMUs. More specifically, the inefficient DMUs mainly had significantly higher electricity, chemical fertilizers, and diesel fuel-related CE emissions, compared with the efficient ones. These results revealed that up to ~ 57–63% CET emissions could be reduced in rice and wheat, if inefficient DMUs start following the management practices of efficient DMUs at their current yield level. The fitted regression model exhibited inverse relationship with rice and wheat yields and CE emissions, which revealed that DEA has optimized the input use at a level of current output level. © 2021, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.",,,,
Inferring Polluted Asian Absorbing Aerosol Properties Using Decadal Scale AERONET Measurements and a MIE Model,"Absorbing aerosols uniquely impact radiation, aerosol transport, and meteorology. This paper quantifies black carbon core and sulphate shell size and mass using decadal measurements of multi-spectral aerosol optical depth, single scattering albedo, and angstrom exponent from Aerosol Robotic Network stations located throughout East, Southeast, and South Asia, in connection with a MIE model. All sites are uniquely characterized into four types: urban, biomass burning, long-range transport, and clean. Unique size and mass probability distributions of both the core and shell are calculated within each classification. Well known urban, biomass burning, and clean sites are all properly identified. Furthermore, two unique sites previously thought to not have multiple characteristics are identified, with urban and biomass burning significant in Beijing and long-range transport significant in the otherwise clean South China Sea at Taiping Island. It is hoped that these results will allow for advances in attribution and radiative forcing studies. © 2021 The Authors.",,,,
"Variability in aerosols properties and sources over rohtak, India","Aerosols are crucial species in climate-related studies due to their significant impacts on radiative forcing. In the present study, Sky-radiometer POM-2 data was used to investigate the source of daily and monthly variability in aerosol properties over Rohtak city for the period from June, 2012-May, 2014. The annual mean values of AOD, Alpha, SSA and ASY were 0.71 ± 0.36, 0.74 ± 0.35, 0.93 ± 0.05 and 0.71 ± 0.02, respectively for the entire study period. The higher value of AOD and the lower value of Alpha during pre-monsoon months indicated the dominance of coarse mode dust particles. During November month, the lower value of SSA (0.84 ± 0.01) suggesting the dominance of absorbing type aerosol which may be associated with the burning of paddy crop residue and firecrackers on Diwali festival, in North-Western India. Another crucial parameter for the aerosol study in volume size distribution which exhibits a bimodal distribution with the first peak at ~0.20 µm for fine mode particles and a second peak at ~ 5 µm for coarse mode particles. Aerosols are classified into four categories by using the ratio of AOD and Alpha: Dust Dominated (DD), Biomass Burning (BB), Anthropogenic Aerosol (AA) and Mixed Type (MT). Dust dominated (DD) aerosols are found maximum during pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons with a fraction of about 26.4% and 19.8%, respectively. Biomass burning (BB) type aerosols are dominant during the post-monsoon and winter seasons with a fraction of 34% and 30%, respectively. © 2021, India Meteorological Department.

Application of Random Forests for Air quality estimation in India by adopting terrain features,"India houses a population of more than a billion. The worlds most polluted cities are in our country. Pollution is present in various forms. Air pollution is on the rise. Excessive vehicular emissions, stubble burning, fire and smoke emissions are some of the major causes. The overall quality of air impacts the health, growth and development of the people. Pollutants present in the air impact the air quality. In order to estimate the quality of air, an Air Quality Index (AQI) is computed. It is done using the concentration levels of the pollutants. Climate also plays a significant role where parameters such as temperature, Wind Speed (WS), Wind Direction (WD), Solar Radiation (SR), Barometric Pressure (BP) affect the quality of air. Earlier works considered only pollutant data to generate models for AQI estimation using machine learning approaches. A further study in the domain showed that terrain features also influence AQI. Thus, the proposed system derives terrain features for any given location. In addition, it considers a combination of pollutant and meteorological parameters to generate the air quality estimation model. Since AQI is a continuous value, regression approach is preferred for modeling. Analysis is performed in three stages, firstly only with pollutant information, secondly with pollutant and climate information and thirdly with pollutant, climate and terrain information. Various regression techniques are applied on the given dataset. The results showcase the consistent performance of an ensemble technique of Random Forests with an overall accuracy of 81%.  © 2020 IEEE.",,,,
Environmental implications of the quality of charcoal briquettes and lump charcoal used for grilling,"Numerous studies have been conducted to assess air pollution and human health risks arising from exposure to outdoor cooking, but limited standards have been implemented around the world to assure fuel quality. While charcoal briquettes and lumps are a popular fuel choice for grilling, almost no data specifying their properties are available to consumers. Because the properties of fuels affect the flue gases, it is critical to understand how the quality of grilling briquettes and lumps translates not only into the quality of the grilled food, but, even more importantly, how their emissions impact human safety and the environment. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the impacts of the quality of charcoal briquettes and lumps on potentially harmful emissions during grilling. To analyze their quality, we used reflected light microscopy to identify a range of contaminants, including biomass, mineral matter, coal, coke, metal, rust, plastics, glues, and synthetic resins, in 74 commercially available products made in Poland, the United States of America, Ukraine, Germany, Belarus, the Czech Republic, and the Republic of South Africa. Our data show that majority of the products analyzed do not meet the existing quality standard EN 1860-2:2005 (E) of less than 1% contaminants, some of these products contain up to 26.6% of impurities. The amount of contaminants correlates with particulate matter, as well as CO and CO2. The contribution of biomass is especially significant because it can be used to predict harmful particulate matter emissions during grilling. The relationship between the composition of charcoal briquettes and lump charcoal and their emissions is particularly strong during the first 15 to 20 min after ignition (when emissions are the highest), therefore, this initial stage is especially unsafe to consumers, and staying away from the grill during this time is recommended. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
Development and Evaluation of a Detailed Mechanism for Gas-Phase Atmospheric Reactions of Furans,"Furan and its alkyl derivatives (furans) are emitted to the atmosphere from multiple sources and can exist in sufficient quantities to affect atmospheric oxidant levels and secondary pollutant formation. Such compounds and their chemical transformations are generally oversimplified in gas-phase chemical mechanisms used for air quality predictions and atmospheric modeling studies. Furans are typically lumped as reactive aromatics, which largely underpredicts their oxidation rates. This work presents a detailed gas-phase mechanism for furans and their major oxidation products. The reactions and rate constants were derived using published data and the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center (SAPRC) mechanism generation system (MechGen). The detailed furans mechanism was implemented in the SAPRC-18 base mechanism to enable evaluation against environmental chamber experiments. A reduced version of the mechanism was developed that maintains consistency and compatibility with the SAPRC-07/-11 base mechanisms. Relative to the lumped SAPRC-11 mechanism, the model skill was improved in predicting furans consumption (21 of 26 experiments) and ""([O3]-[NO]). For the latter, mean model bias was reduced to ±10% for 13 experiments (4 for SAPRC-11) and was >±20% for only 3 experiments (11 for SAPRC-11). Sensitivity simulations were performed to evaluate the relative importance of hydroxyl radical (OH)-, nitrate radical (NO3)-, and ozone (O3)-initiated photo-oxidation. While OH-initiated reactions are the major sink for furans, reactions with NO3 and O3 become non-negligible or even of equal importance under dark or high O3 conditions, such as may be expected during biomass burning events. The detailed furans mechanism was developed with no tuning to fit the experimental data used for evaluation and to facilitate the broad application of the mechanism for atmospheric and air quality modeling.

"Disparities in particulate matter (PM10) origins and oxidative potential at a city scale (Grenoble, France) - Part 2: Sources of PM10 oxidative potential using multiple linear regression analysis and the predictive applicability of multilayer perceptron neural network analysis","The oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) measures PM capability to potentially cause anti-oxidant imbalance. Due to the wide range and complex mixture of species in particulates, little is known about the pollution sources most strongly contributing to OP. A 1-year sampling of PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter below 10) was performed over different sites in a medium-sized city (Grenoble, France). An enhanced fine-scale apportionment of PM10 sources, based on the chemical composition, was performed using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) method and reported in a companion paper (Borlaza et al., 2020). OP was assessed as the ability of PM10 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) using three different acellular assays: dithiothreitol (DTT), ascorbic acid (AA), and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) assays. Using multiple linear regression (MLR), the OP contributions of the sources identified by PMF were estimated. Conversely, since atmospheric processes are usually non-linear in nature, artificial neural network (ANN) techniques, which employ non-linear models, could further improve estimates. Hence, the multilayer perceptron analysis (MLP), an ANN-based model, was additionally used to model OP based on PMF-resolved sources as well. This study presents the spatiotemporal variabilities of OP activity with influences by season-specific sources, site typology and specific local features, and assay sensitivity. Overall, both MLR and MLP effectively captured the evolution of OP. The primary traffic and biomass burning sources were the strongest drivers of OP in the Grenoble basin. There is also a clear redistribution of source-specific impacts when using OP instead of mass concentration, underlining the importance of PM redox activity for the identification of potential sources of PM toxicity. Finally, the MLP generally offered improvements in OP prediction, especially for sites where synergistic and/or antagonistic effects between sources are prominent, supporting the value of using ANN-based models to account for the non-linear dynamics behind the atmospheric processes affecting OP of PM10.  © 2021 Lucille Joanna S.

Experimental production of charcoal morphologies to discriminate fuel source and fire type: An example from Siberian taiga,"The analysis of charcoal fragments in peat and lake sediments is the most widely used approach to reconstruct past biomass burning. With a few exceptions, this method typically relies on the quantification of the total charcoal content of the sediment. To enhance charcoal analyses for the reconstruction of past fire regimes and make the method more relevant to studies of both plant evolution and fire management, the extraction of more information from charcoal particles is critical. Here, I used a muffle oven to burn seven fuel types comprising 17 species from boreal Siberia (near Teguldet village), which are also commonly found in the Northern Hemisphere, and built on published schemes to develop morphometric and finer diagnostic classifications of the experimentally charred particles. I then combined these results with those from fossil charcoal from a peat core taken from the same location (Ulukh-Chayakh mire) in order to demonstrate the relevance of these experiments to the fossil charcoal records. Results show that graminoids, Sphagnum, and wood (trunk) lose the most mass at low burn temperatures (<300gg C), whereas heathland shrub leaves, brown moss, and ferns lose the most mass at high burn temperatures. This suggests that species with low mass retention in high-temperature fires are likely to be under-represented in the fossil charcoal record. The charcoal particle aspect ratio appeared to be the strongest indicator of the fuel type burnt. Graminoid charcoal particles are the most elongate (6.7-11.5), with a threshold above 6 that may be indicative of wetland graminoids; leaves are the shortest and bulkiest (2.1-3.5); and twigs and wood are intermediate (2.0-5.2). Further, the use of fine diagnostic features was more successful in separating wood, graminoids, and leaves, but it was difficult to further differentiate these fuel types due to overlapping features. High-aspect-ratio particles, dominated by graminoid and Sphagnum morphologies, may be robust indicators of low-temperature surface fires, whereas abundant wood and leaf morphologies as well as low-aspect-ratio particles are indicative of higher-temperature fires. However, the overlapping morphologies of leaves and wood from trees and shrubs make it hard to distinguish between high-intensity surface fires, combusting living shrubs and dead wood and leaves, and high-intensity crown fires that have burnt living trees. Distinct particle shape may also influence charcoal transportation, with elongated particles (graminoids) potentially having a more heterogeneous distribution and being deposited farther away from the origin of fire than the rounder, polygonal leaf particles. Despite these limitations, the combined use of charred-particle aspect ratios and fuel morphotypes can aid in the more robust interpretation of fuel source and fire-type changes. Lastly, I highlight the further investigations needed to refine the histories of past wildfires. © Author(s) 2021.",,,,
Seasonal And Morphological Analysis Of Airborne PM10 And PM2.5 In Srinagar Garhwal (Himalaya Region),"To understand the morphology and chemical constituent of ambient air in Srinagar, Garhwal valley, an experiment was carried out in the Department of Physics, Chauras campus, Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University. The particulate matter (PMs) were collected by using fine particulate dust sampler (APM 550 and APM 460 NL, Envirotech, New Delhi) and analysed by using SEM and EDAX technique (CARL ZEISS, MA15/EV018). The average mass concentration of PM10 is recorded as 107.4 ± 16.3 μg/m3, whereas the average mass concentration of PM2.5 is recorded as 88.48 ± 14.74 μg/m3 which are much higher than the standard value prescribed by WHO and NAAQS. The reason behind such a huge concentration is identified as massive construction of building, stone crusher factory and exponential growth in vehicles, forest fire and other anthropogenic activities in the surrounding area. The SEM analysis suggest that silicon (Si), oxygen (O), sodium (Na), aluminium (Al) are dominantly present in form of silica (SiO2), aluminosilicate (Si-AI rich), sea spray, mineral dust and gold (Au), zinc (Zn) and barium (Ba) may be present due to natural ores in surrounding hills in all seasons. But in the case of the post-monsoon season, nearly 25% of PM2.5 consists of carbon particles, which is more likely to be coming from soot particle emission from biomass burning. © 2020 - Kalpana Corporation.",,,,
Trace Elements From Ocean-Going Vessels in East Asia: Vanadium and Nickel Emissions and Their Impacts on Air Quality,"Vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) are considered the most abundant trace metals in ship exhaust burning heavy fuel oils. This study is the first attempt to estimate the impact of V and Ni from shipping on air quality in East Asia for the year 2015. In this study, emission inventories of V and Ni from shipping and land-based sources were constructed and implemented into the revised aerosol module to simulate ambient V and Ni concentrations. Our results showed that ship emissions contributed the majority of vanadium and were important to nickel emissions in most coastal regions in East Asia, with the contributions exceeding 60% and approximately 40% in some regions, respectively. The simulated ambient V and Ni concentrations has been validated by the measurements, and the comparison revealed there was an obvious improvement (reducing the mean bias by 32%–63%) in the model performance of the V and Ni predictions after including shipping emissions. Our study filled the gaps of trace element contributions in coastal regions and implied that the impact of metals from shipping traffic on regional air quality is worthy of attention in East Asia. Although the International Maritime Organization (IMO) low-sulfur fuel policy has been implemented since 2020, the impact of shipping traffic on trace metals with respect to regional air quality is still important given heavy fuel oils being in use. © 2021.

Determination of lidar ratio for major aerosol types over western north pacific based on long-term MPLNET data,"East Asia is the most complex region in the world for aerosol studies, as it encounters a lot of varieties of aerosols, and aerosol classification can be a challenge in this region. In the present study, we focused on the relationship between aerosol types and aerosol optical properties. We analyzed the long-term (2005-2012) data of vertical profiles of aerosol extinction coefficients, lidar ratio (Sp), and other aerosol optical properties obtained from a NASA Micro-Pulse Lidar Network and Aerosol Robotic Network site in northern Taiwan, which frequently receives Asian continental outflows. Based on aerosol extinction vertical profiles, the profiles were classified into two types: type 1 (single-layer structure) and type 2 (two-layer structure). Fall season (October-November) was the prevailing season for the Type 1, whereas type 2 mainly happened in spring (March-April). In type 1, air masses normally originated from three regional sectors, i.e., Asia continental (AC), Pacific Ocean (PO), and Southeast Asia (SA). The mean Sp values were 39 ± 17 sr, 30 ± 12 sr, and 38 ± 18 sr for the AC, PO, and SA sectors, respectively. The Sp results suggested that aerosols from the AC sector contained dust and anthropogenic particles, and aerosols from the PO sector were most likely sea salts. We further combined the EPA dust event database and backward trajectory analysis for type 2. Results showed that Sp was 41 ± 14 sr and 53 ± 21 sr for dust storm and biomass-burning events, respectively. The Sp for biomass-burning events in type 2 showed two peaks patterns. The first peak occurred within range of 30-50 sr corresponding to urban pollutant, and the second peak occurred within range of 60-80 sr in relation to biomass burning. Finally, our study summarized the Sp values for four major aerosol types over northern Taiwan, viz., urban (42 ± 18 sr), dust (34 ± 6 sr), biomass-burning (69 ± 12 sr), and oceanic (30 ± 12 sr). Our findings provide useful references for aerosol classification and air pollution identification over the western North Pacific. ©",,,,
Size-resolved characterization of organic aerosol in the North China Plain: New insights from high resolution spectral analysis,"Organic aerosol (OA), a large fraction of fine particles, has a large impact on climate radiative forcing and human health, and the impact depends strongly on size distributions. Here we conducted size-resolved OA measurements using a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer at urban and rural sites in the North China Plain (NCP) in summer and winter. Our results showed substantially different size distributions of OA with the diameters peaking at ∼550 nm in summer, and 420 nm and 350 nm at urban and rural sites, respectively, during wintertime. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) of size-resolved high-resolution mass spectra of OA resolved various OA factors at urban and rural sites. In particular, we found that the mass spectra of the same type of secondary OA (SOA) from bulk PMF analysis can be largely different across different sizes. Biomass burning OA (BBOA) and fossil-fuel-related OA (FFOA) showed broad size distributions peaking at 350 nm in winter at the rural site, where primary OA (POA BBOA + FFOA) dominated OA across different sizes. Comparatively, secondary OA (SOA) in the NCP peaked at ∼400-500 nm during wintertime, and ∼500-650 nm in summer. SOA played an enhanced role during more severely polluted days with peak diameters shifting to larger sizes, while the changes in POA size distributions were small. The size-resolved oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratios were also determined and linked with the hygroscopicity parameter of OA (kOA). The results showed that kOA increased substantially with particle size, with higher values in summer in Beijing (0.28 ± 0.021) than those during wintertime (0.17 ± 0.019 and 0.12 ± 0.018). The size-resolved kOA would benefit a better prediction of cloud condensation nuclei than bulk kOA in future studies. © 2021 Environmental Science: Atmospheres. All right reserved.",,,,
Procreation of training data using cognitive science in temporal data processing for burnt paddy fields mapping,"While mapping specific classes such as burnt paddy fields at an interval require temporal remote sensing images that need ground truth data collection to be conducted during image acquisition. Frequent collection of such training data as per the frequency of acquisition of temporal data is time and cost dependent as well as cumbersome. The cognitive science concept has been applied to extend training data from seed training samples in the time domain to reduce ground visits for collecting training data. Since cognitive science is an interdisciplinary study of the mind and its processes, this research has tried to generate training samples in the past and the future within the paddy stubble burning cycle from the seed training samples collected from the ground. In this research work, seed training data collected on 25th October 2019 extended for 27th October 2019, 4th November 2019, 6th November 2019, as well as 20th October 2019, 17th October 2019, 15th October 2019 and 12th October 2019, temporal images for burnt field's identification. Favorable results were achieved through cognitive science using augmented training data in burnt paddy field mapping. The Mean Membership Difference between the training and testing site shows up to 98% accuracy. The largest burnt area was found between 4th Nov 2019 to 6th Nov 2019.The F-Score, Kappa and overall accuracy were found to be 98% in identifying the burnt paddy fields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
Experimental manipulation of fuel structure to evaluate the potential ecological effects of fire,"A better understanding of how dominant fuels affect fire behavior can improve predictions and comparisons of the ecological effects of fires in forests and other ecosystems. Current methods for evaluating effects of fuel characteristics on fire behavior, including maximum temperature and heating duration, range from small-scale laboratory to large-scale field experiments. Small-scale experiments often have many replicates and high measurement precision but can lack realism, while field experiments may have few replicates and lower measurement precision, thereby making comparisons across ecosystems difficult. Here, we present a method to experimentally evaluate ecological effects of fire while maintaining realism in fuel structure. We applied the method to investigate fire behavior effects of cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), an invasive grass with a vertical growth form that is widespread across Southeast US forests. Examining the effect of fuel structure (piled vs. standing) on fire behavior for a range of fuel loads illustrated how more realistic standing fuels produced shorter heating duration (s above 100 °C), taller flame heights, and faster spread rates compared to piled fuels. Average heating duration was ~2–4 times longer and ranged more widely when fuels were piled (80–277 s) compared to standing (41–57 s). Flame heights were ~1.4 times taller when fuels were standing than piled. These differences highlight that maintaining natural fuel structure in experimental fires produces more realistic estimates of fire behavior and effects. Consequently, not maintaining realistic vertical fuel structure could lead to overestimation of potential fire impacts related to temperature (e.g., tissue damage) but underestimate potential impacts related to flame heights, such as total engulfment of tree seedlings and saplings by fire. Altogether, our method effectively maintained fuel structure, enabling assessment of more probable fire behavior and impacts of the invasive grass than if fuels were simply piled. This approach may help further bridge the gap in realism between small-scale experiments and large-scale fires, enabling comparisons of the ecological effects of fires and fire-invasion interactions across forest ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
"Source identification of fine and coarse aerosol during smog episodes in Debrecen, Hungary","In this study, the identification of PM sources during smog episodes in Debrecen is presented. The smog episodes were characterized by the high concentration of PM10, and were linked to a thermal inversion period in November 2011 in Hungary, when an anticyclone occurred across Europe. The sources of PM2.5 and PMcoarse were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF). Additionally, the source locations were explored by using the conditional probability function (CPF). A numerical weather prediction model (WRF) was also applied to evaluate the air pollution situation. In order to meet the goals of the study, the elemental composition with high (2-h) time resolution, the elemental size distribution, and the planetary boundary layer were examined in an urban background site of downtown Debrecen, Hungary. Our results highlight the importance of biomass burning (39%) and traffic (31%) as the major contributors to PM2.5. The main tracers of these sources (K, Cl, Pb, Zn) appeared mainly in droplet mode (0.5–1 μm). The major sources of PMcoarse fraction were soil (32%), and dust attributed to tramline construction (30%). The combination of PMF and CPF results revealed that the PM10 concentrations were affected by sources within the urban agglomeration of Debrecen (city centre and suburban areas) under the given meteorological conditions. This conclusion is further validated by the fact that the diurnal variation of the identified source contributions presented a distinct pattern that depended strongly on the daily activities of the city’s residents (compared to the usually unstructured diurnals of transported sources). © 2021, The Author(s).",,,,
On the relationship between cloud water composition and cloud droplet number concentration,"Aerosol cloud interactions are the largest source of uncertainty in quantifying anthropogenic radiative forcing. The large uncertainty is, in part, due to the difficulty of predicting cloud microphysical parameters, such as the cloud droplet number concentration (Nd). Even though rigorous first-principle approaches exist to calculate Nd, the cloud and aerosol research community also relies on empirical approaches such as relating Nd to aerosol mass concentration. Here we analyze relationships between Nd and cloud water chemical composition, in addition to the effect of environmental factors on the degree of the relationships. Warm, marine, stratocumulus clouds off the California coast were sampled throughout four summer campaigns between 2011 and 2016. A total of 385 cloud water samples were collected and analyzed for 80 chemical species. Single- and multispecies log log linear regressions were performed to predict Nd using chemical composition. Single-species regressions reveal that the species that best predicts Nd is total sulfate (R2 adj D 0:40). Multispecies regressions reveal that adding more species does not necessarily produce a better model, as six or more species yield regressions that are statistically insignificant. A commonality among the multispecies regressions that produce the highest correlation with Nd was that most included sulfate (either total or non-seasalt), an ocean emissions tracer (such as sodium), and an organic tracer (such as oxalate). Binning the data according to turbulence, smoke influence, and in-cloud height allowed for examination of the effect of these environmental factors on the composition Nd correlation. Accounting for turbulence, quantified as the standard deviation of vertical wind speed, showed that the correlation between Nd with both total sulfate and sodium increased at higher turbulence conditions, consistent with turbulence promoting the mixing between ocean surface and cloud base. Considering the influence of smoke significantly improved the correlation with Nd for two biomass burning tracer species in the study region, specifically oxalate and iron. When binning by in-cloud height, non-sea-salt sulfate and sodium correlated best with Nd at cloud top, whereas iron and oxalate correlated best with Nd at cloud base. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Biomass burning organic aerosol from prescribed burning and other activities in the United States,"A three-dimensional chemical transport model, PMCAMx-SR, was applied in the continental U.S. to investigate the contribution of prescribed burning and other biomass burning sources to the total organic aerosol (OA) concentrations. Simulations were performed during three seasonally-representative months (April, July and September 2008). Prescribed biomass burning organic aerosol (bbOA) emission rates were estimated to be approximately 300, 80 and 250 tn d−1 during April, July and September respectively. Prescribed burning was limited during July due to the prevailing weather conditions. Prescribed burning is responsible for 45% of the total bbOA emissions during the simulated spring period, 20% during the fall, and just 3% during the summer. The predicted maximum hourly prescribed bbOA concentration reached approximately 100 μg m−3 during April in South Carolina and during September in New Mexico, whereas it was less than 15 μg m−3 during July in Arkansas. The average contribution of prescribed burning to OA in the continental U.S. is quite low (less than 5%) and 60–70% is predicted to be secondary OA. Biomass burning secondary organic aerosol (bbSOA) levels far away from the prescribed fires are predicted to exceed 2 μg m−3. In states with intensive prescribed burning activities this source is predicted to contribute 20–40% of the OA on a monthly average basis. In these states (for example South Carolina during April), the predictions reveal that people can be exposed for 20 h per month on average to bbOA levels exceeding 5 μg m−3 and for 200 h to levels above 0.5 μg m−3. This should be contrasted to 220 h of exposure to bbOA above 5 μg m−3 and 650 h to bbOA above 0.5 μg m−3 for states and periods with intense wild fires (for example California during July). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Distribution and gas-particle partitioning of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons over the East China Sea and Yellow Sea in spring: Role of atmospheric transport transition,"To elucidate the variations in the East Asian monsoon system during seasonal changes and their impacts on continental outflow of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), sixteen integrated air samples were collected during a research cruise covering the Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS) in mid-spring of 2017. The concentrations of total suspended particle (TSP), aerosol-phase PAH fractions, ratios of organic to elemental carbon (OC/EC) and gas-particle partitioning of atmospheric PAHs exhibited clear regional differences associated with variations in the monsoon regime. The total concentrations of 16 USEPA priority PAHs (Σ16PAHs) varied from 3.11 to 13.4 ng/m3 throughout the cruise, with medium-to-high molecular weight (MW) PAHs more enriched over the YS and north ECS than the south ECS. Together with the relatively low gaseous PAH fraction over the YS and north ECS (78 ± 4%) relative to the south ECS (95 ± 13%), this result indicates the pattern of regional atmospheric transport. The ratio of organic to elemental carbon varied significantly between the south ECS (lower than 4) and the YS and north ECS (greater than 4), indicating contributions from vehicle emissions and coal combustion or biomass burning, respectively, following different atmospheric input pathways of carbonaceous aerosols, as supported by backward trajectory analysis. Considering the gas-particle partitioning of PAHs, soot adsorption was the main partitioning mechanism in the study region; while high-MW PAHs in the YS and north ECS were influenced by both absorption and adsorption. The Koa absorption model provided better predictions for high-MW PAHs when continental air masses prevailed, despite underestimating the partition coefficients (kp) of low-MW PAHs. Meanwhile, predicted kp for medium MW PAHs was better estimated over the YS and ECS when Ksa was included. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
An improved combined vegetation difference index and burn scar index approach for mapping cropland burned areas using combined data from Landsat 8 multispectral and thermal infrared bands,"The accurate extraction of agricultural burned area is essential for fire-induced air quality models and assessments of agricultural grain loss and wildfire disasters. The present study provides an improved approach for mapping uncontrolled cropland burned areas, which involves pre-classification using a difference vegetation index model for various agricultural land scenarios. Land surface temperature was analysed in burned and unburned areas and integrated into a previous burn scar index (BSI) model, and multispectral and thermal infrared information were combined to create a new temperature BSI (TBSI) to remove background noise. The TBSI model was applied to a winter wheat agricultural region in the Haihe River Basin in northern China. The extracted burned areas were validated using Gaofen-1 satellite data and compared with those produced by the previous BSI model. The producer and user accuracy of the new TBSI model were measured at 92.42 and 95.31% respectively, with an overall kappa value of 0.92, whereas those of the previous BSI model were 83.33, 87.30% and 0.86. The results indicate that the new method is more appropriate for mapping uncontrolled winter wheat burned area. Potential applications of this research include trace gas emission models, agricultural fire management and agricultural wildfire disaster assessment. © 2020 IAWF.",,,,
Re-examining Dust Chemical Aging and Its Impacts on Earth's Climate,"Conspectus The impact of atmospheric particulate matter (i.e., aerosols) on Earth's radiative balance has been and continues to be the leading source of uncertainty with respect to predictions of future temperature increases due to climate change. Mineral dust particles transported from deserts and semiarid regions across the globe are a dominant contributor to the aerosol burden. Dust has many and diverse effects on Earth's climate: It directly scatters and/or absorbs incoming sunlight; it reacts with trace gases leading to impacts on the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere that affect both the lifetime of the greenhouse gas methane in addition to concentrations of tropospheric ozone- A greenhouse gas and criteria air pollutant; it influences the production as well as the lifetime and radiative properties of clouds; and it deposits nutrients to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that can stimulate primary production and facilitate the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This Account will focus on the last three effects. The ability of dust to affect clouds and biogeochemical cycles hinges upon the chemical nature of dust particles-in particular, whether the compounds found in dust particles are water-soluble. The solubility of nutrients found in dust is particularly critical for determining the impact of atmospheric deposition on ocean productivity. The traditional viewpoint is that dust is inherently insoluble but reactive toward trace acidic gases, a process herein referred to as chemical aging. These reactions are thought to affect the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere while effectively transforming the chemical composition of dust by increasing its solubility. Consequently, chemical aging is hypothesized to substantially increase the impact of dust on cloud droplet formation and marine biogeochemical cycles.This Account presents recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that determine how efficiently dust undergoes chemical aging and what the consequences of these processes are for the different effects of dust on Earth's climate. This Account will re-examine the traditional viewpoint that dust chemical aging strongly impacts marine biogeochemical cycles as well as the ability of dust to nucleate cloud droplets. Laboratory studies on environmental samples are combined with chemical analysis of field samples collected at dust transport receptor sites to better understand chemical aging mechanisms and determine the impact of dust on tropospheric oxidants, clouds, and biogeochemical cycles. Our results highlight the important role that dust mineralogy plays in both the nucleation of clouds as well as the kinetics responsible for the chemical aging of dust. This Account will present cases where dust contains inherently soluble minerals and does not require chemical aging in order to efficiently nucleate clouds in the atmosphere. Lastly, this Account illustrates the critical role that nondust aerosols, namely, wildfire and combustion emissions, play as a supplier of soluble nutrients important for biogeochemical cycles, particularly in marine environments. This Account will discuss these findings and highlight future research directions and recommendations to better understand dust-climate interactions and the emerging role of biomass burning aerosol in marine biogeochemical cycles. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,,
Snow albedo reduction in central andes by atmospheric aerosols: Case study on the Tunuyán Basin (Argentina),"Changes in snow albedo (SA) on several basins of the central Andes of Argentina are associated with the possible deposition of light-absorbing particles (LAP) in the austral spring. To demonstrate this possibility, we correlate SA with daily data of snow cover (SC), aerosol optical depth (AOD) and land surface temperature (LST) available from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board NASA Terra satellite during 2000-2016, and other derived parameters such as days after albedo (DAS) and snow precipitation (SP) from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). We used satellite pixels with 100% snow cover to obtain monthly average value of SA, LST, AOD, DAS and SP performing multiple regression analysis. Further, we analysed biomass burning emissions in northern Argentina using MODIS products MCD64 collection C6 as possible source for snow pollution. Aerosol deposition and trajectories were analysed using WRF-Chem atmospheric numerical prediction model, with inventories of regional anthropogenic emissions of own elaboration (lat. 0.025&deg; &times; long. 0.025&deg;) and the estimation of open burning emissions from the FINN global inventory (Fire INventory from NCAR). © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

"High-resolution emission inventory of gaseous and particulate pollutants in Shandong Province, eastern China","To characterize the anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, VOCs, NOx, SO2, and CO) in Shandong Province, eastern China, the high-resolution emission inventories were developed using the “bottom-up” methodology. The emission sources were categorized to biomass burning, dust, fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, solvent utilization, waste disposal, and on-road vehicles, with five-level classification and 399 subclasses. Emission factors were collected from China's guidelines on the emissions of atmospheric pollutants and literatures with local measurements. Particularly, those for on-road vehicles were calculated by COPERT v5. The county-level activity data were obtained from the governmental statistics. Results showed that the estimated anthropogenic emissions of PM2.5, PM10, VOCs, NOx, SO2, and CO in Shandong Province in 2016 were 5136.8, 5685.4, 3257.1, 1430.6, 240.6, and 19618.8 kt, respectively. The main emission source of PM2.5 and PM10 were dust and it was industrial processes for VOCs and CO. On-road vehicles and fossil fuel combustion contributed the most to NOx and SO2 emissions, respectively. The composition of emissions by sources for each pollutant differed among cities. Emissions in Shandong displayed remarkable spatial variations, with the highest in the central, southern, and coastal areas. This study could be expected to supply sufficient information and basic data for formulating effective environmental management policies and further improving the air quality in Shandong Province and even in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Atmospheric chemical loss processes of isocyanic acid (HNCO): a combined theoretical kinetic and global modelling study,"Isocyanic acid (HNCO) is a chemical constituent suspected to be harmful to humans if ambient concentrations exceed ∼1ppbv. HNCO is mainly emitted by combustion processes but is also inadvertently released by NOx mitigation measures in flue gas treatments. With increasing biomass burning and more widespread usage of catalytic converters in car engines, good prediction of HNCO atmospheric levels with global models is desirable. Little is known directly about the chemical loss processes of HNCO, which limits the implementation in global Earth system models. This study aims to close this knowledge gap by combining a theoretical kinetic study on the major oxidants reacting with HNCO with a global modelling study. The potential energy surfaces of the reactions of HNCO with OH and NO3 radicals, Cl atoms, and ozone were studied using high-level CCSD(T)/CBS(DTQ)//M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ quantum chemical methodologies, followed by transition state theory (TST) theoretical kinetic predictions of the rate coefficients at temperatures of 200-3000K. It was found that the reactions are all slow in atmospheric conditions, with k (300K) ≤ 7×10-16 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, and that product formation occurs predominantly by H abstraction; the predictions are in good agreement with earlier experimental work, where available. The reverse reactions of NCO radicals with H2O, HNO3, and HCl, of importance mostly in combustion, were also examined briefly. The findings are implemented into the atmospheric model EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) to estimate the importance of each chemical loss process on a global scale. The EMAC predictions confirm that the gasphase chemical loss of HNCO is a negligible process, contributing less than 1% and leaving heterogeneous losses as the major sinks. The removal of HNCO by clouds and precipitation contributes about 10%of the total loss, while globally dry deposition is the main sink, accounting for ∼ 90 %. The global simulation also shows that due to its long chemical lifetime in the free troposphere, HNCO can be efficiently transported into the UTLS by deep convection events. Dailyaverage mixing ratios of ground-level HNCO are found to regularly exceed 1 ppbv in regions dominated by biomass burning events, but rarely exceed levels above 10 ppt in other areas of the troposphere, though locally instantaneous toxic levels are expected. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Fire alters the availability of soil nutrients and accelerates growth of Eucalyptus grandis in Zambia,"Fire has been used to prepare land during tree plantation establishment for many years but uncertainty about how ecosystems respond to prescribed burning makes it difficult to predict the effects of fire on soil nutrients. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of burning accumulated forest residues (slash) on soil chemical properties and how trees respond. We analyzed 40 burned and unburned sites and compared growth of Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden between sites. Soil pH increased by 39% after fire, suggesting reduced soil acidity and increased liming. Total nitrogen increased by 100%; other nutrients (Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+) also increased. Increase in nutrients had a significant effect on the growth of E. grandis; larger and taller trees were associated more with burned than unburned sites. This study provides evidence that burning accumulated slash during land preparation prior to plantation establishment alters soil nutrient status and enhances the growth of E. grandis. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,,
Modeling biomass and nutrients in a eucalyptus stand in the cerrado,"The prediction of biological processes, which involve growth and plant development, is possible via the adjustment of mathematical models. In forest areas, these models assist in management practices, silviculture, harvesting, and soil fertility. Diameter, basal area, and height are predictors of volume and biomass estimates in forest stands. This study utilized different non-linear models for estimating biomass and nutrient values in the aerial biomass and roots of an unmanaged eucalypt stand in Cerrado dystrophic soil. It was hypothesized that the models would estimate the nutrients of the aboveground biomass and roots after meeting the selection and validation criteria. By statistical analysis of the parameters and subsequent validation, the Schumacher–Hall model was presented to be the best fit for biomass and nutrients. This result confirmed the ability of different variables, including diameter, basal area, and height, to be predicted. Estimating the nutrient values in the aboveground biomass and roots allowed a better understanding of the quality of the vegetal residues that remained in the soil. For dystrophic soils, which occur in the Cerrado, these estimates become even more relevant. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,,,
Neural network based aod550 and pm10 estimation using limited meteorological data in Baghdad City: Case study,"Aerosol optical depth (AOD550) and particulate matter (PM10) is a significant impact on air pollution produced by biomass burning combustion fossil. In order to training and estimating daily (AOD550) and (PM10) in Baghdad, Iraq, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed. The activation functions (Gaussian, Hyperbolic Tangent, Hyperbolic Secant), hidden layers (2, 3 and 4), alterations ranged between 10000 to 50000 with 10000 interval were employed for both hidden and output layers. In order to evaluate the developed ANN models the statistical criteria on the base of the correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were determined. According to the statistical criteria were calculated to examine the developed ANN models. It was found that the optimum ANN models among all considered ANN models were ANN model (53 and 107) where (R), and (RMSE) were 0.939, 0.962 and 0.055, 4.3 respectively for estimation stages. These results provide capability of the generalization of the ANN model have a power full performance in pollutant calculations. © 2021 Alpha Publishers. All rights reserved.",,,,
"Evaluation Of Finite Mixture Models For Describing The Structure Of Disturbed Gmelina Stands In Oluwa Forest Reserve, Nigeria","Finite mixture model is relevant for describing diameter distribution that is multimodal or heavily skewed. Irregular diameter distribution is partly caused by forest disturbance such as bush burning and illegal logging. This study evaluated five finite mixture models for describing the irregular diameter distributions of the disturbed Gmelina arborea Roxb stands in Oluwa Forest Reserve, Nigeria. Twenty plots of 0.04 ha size, five each from four stand ages (19, 24, 29 and 34 years) were used in this study. Five finite mixture models: gamma, Gompertz, log-logistic, lognormal and Weibull mixtures were considered. The quality of fits produced by the models were evaluated with five indices: Anderson-Darling, Cramer-von Mises, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Akaike Information Criterion and Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion. Relative rank sum from the indices was analysed using One-way analysis of variance. The results showed that gamma mixture had the smallest indices and relative rank, but not significantly different from Weibull and log-logistic mixtures (p > 0.05). Lognormal and Gompertz mixtures performed poorly. The order of ranking was: gamma followed by Weibull, log-logistic, lognormal and Gompertz. Application of the mixture models provided good predictions of the forest stand volume © 2021. Floresta. All Rights Reserved.",,,,
Organic aerosol volatility and viscosity in the North China Plain: Contrast between summer and winter,"Volatility and viscosity have substantial impacts on gas-particle partitioning, formation and evolution of aerosol and hence the predictions of aerosol-related air quality and climate effects. Here aerosol volatility and viscosity at a rural site (Gucheng) and an urban site (Beijing) in the North China Plain (NCP) in summer and winter were investigated by using a thermodenuder coupled with a highresolution aerosol mass spectrometer. The effective saturation concentration (C) of organic aerosol (OA) in summer was smaller than that in winter (0.55 μgm-3 vs. 0.71- 0.75 μgm-3), indicating that OA in winter in the NCP is more volatile due to enhanced primary emissions from coal combustion and biomass burning. The volatility distributions varied and were largely different among different OA factors. In particular, we found that hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) contained more nonvolatile compounds compared to coalcombustion- related OA. The more oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA) showed overall lower volatility than less oxidized OOA (LO-OOA) in both summer and winter, yet the volatility of MO-OOA was found to be relative humidity (RH) dependent showing more volatile properties at higher RH. Our results demonstrated the different composition and chemical formation pathways of MO-OOA under different RH levels. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and viscosity of OA in summer and winter are estimated using the recently developed parameterization formula. Our results showed that the Tg of OA in summer in Beijing (291.5 K) was higher than that in winter (289.7-290.0 K), while it varied greatly among different OA factors. The viscosity suggested that OA existed mainly as solid in winter in Beijing (RHD29-17 %), but as semisolids in Beijing in summer (RHD48-25 %) and Gucheng in winter (RHD68-24 %). These results have the important implication that kinetically limited gas-particle partitioning may need to be considered when simulating secondary OA formation in the NCP. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Toward a place-based learning progression for haze pollution in the northern region of Thailand,"Haze pollution has been an annual environmental problem in the northern region of Thailand. The main causes include agricultural burning and wildfires that are enhanced by the high atmospheric pressure in a geographical plain encircled by mountains. Attempts have been made to address this problem, and place-based education is seen as crucial in this effort. Students are expected to understand and to engage in efforts to solve this problem in their living place. This research aims at developing a place-based learning progression on haze pollution for secondary students (grade 7–12) in Thailand. Fifty-five students in the seventh and 10th grades completed an open-ended questionnaire on haze pollution. The questions addressed the causes, processes, effects, and solutions. Subsequently, 17 students from the seventh through the 12th grades participated in semi-structured interviews, which required the use of abductive reasoning to offer explanations for the seasonal peak in haze in their region. Student responses were analyzed through an iterative process to determine their knowledge of the issue. The results provided data to develop a learning progression for haze pollution in the region, which can facilitate the design of a place-based curriculum and instruction on this topic. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",,,,
"Characterization of urban amine-containing particles in southwestern China: Seasonal variation, source, and processing","Amine-containing particles were characterized in an urban area of Chongqing during both summer and winter using a single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS). Among the collected particles, 12.7% were amine-containing in winter and 8.3% in summer. Amines were internally mixed with elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), sulfate, and nitrate. Diethylamine (DEA) was the most abundant among amine-containing particles. Wintertime amine-containing particles were mainly from the northwest direction where a forest park was located; in summer, they were from the northwest and southwest (traffic hub) directions. These origins suggest that vegetation and traffic were the primary sources of particulate amines. The average relative peak area of DEA depended strongly on humidity, indicating that the enhancement of DEA was possibly due to increasing aerosol water content and aerosol acidity. Using an adaptive resonance theory neural network (ART-2a) algorithm, four major types of amine-containing particles were clustered: amine-organic carbon (A-OC), A-OCEC, DEA-OC, and A-OCEC aged. The identified particle types implied that amines were taken up by particles produced from traffic and biomass burning. The knowledge gained in this study is useful to understand the atmospheric processing, origin, and sources of amine-containing particles in the urban area of Chongqing. © 2019 Author(s).",,,,
Effects of near-source coagulation of biomass burning aerosols on global predictions of aerosol size distributions and implications for aerosol radiative effects,"Biomass burning is a significant global source of aerosol number and mass. In fresh biomass burning plumes, aerosol coagulation reduces aerosol number and increases the median size of aerosol size distributions, impacting aerosol radiative effects. Near-source biomass burning aerosol coagulation occurs at spatial scales much smaller than the grid boxes of global and many regional models. To date, these models have ignored sub-grid coagulation and instantly mixed fresh biomass burning emissions into coarse grid boxes. A previous study found that the rate of particle growth by coagulation within an individual smoke plume can be approximated using the aerosol mass emissions rate, initial size distribution median diameter and modal width, plume mixing depth, and wind speed. In this paper, we use this parameterization of sub-grid coagulation in the GEOS-Chem-TOMAS (TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional) global aerosol microphysics model to quantify the impacts on global aerosol size distributions, the direct radiative effect, and the cloud-albedo aerosol indirect effect. We find that inclusion of biomass burning sub-grid coagulation reduces the biomass burning impact on the number concentration of particles larger than 80&thinsp;nm (a proxy for CCN-sized particles) by 37&thinsp;% globally. This cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) reduction causes our estimated global biomass burning cloud-albedo aerosol indirect effect to decrease from -76 to -43&thinsp;mW&thinsp;m-2. Further, as sub-grid coagulation moves mass to sizes with more efficient scattering, including it increases our estimated biomass burning all-sky direct effect from -224 to -231&thinsp;mW&thinsp;m-2, with assumed external mixing of black carbon and from -188 to -197&thinsp;mW&thinsp;m-2 and with assumed internal mixing of black carbon with core-shell morphology. However, due to differences in fire and meteorological conditions across regions, the impact of sub-grid coagulation is not globally uniform. We also test the sensitivity of the impact of sub-grid coagulation to two different biomass burning emission inventories to various assumptions about the fresh biomass burning aerosol size distribution and to two different timescales of sub-grid coagulation. The impacts of sub-grid coagulation are qualitatively the same regardless of these assumptions. © Author(s) 2019.",,,,
Simulation of the chemical evolution of biomass burning organic aerosol,"The chemical transport model PMCAMx was extended to investigate the effects of partitioning and photochemical aging of biomass burning emissions on organic aerosol (OA) concentrations. A source-resolved version of the model, PMCAMx-SR, was developed in which biomass burning emissions and their oxidation products are represented separately from the other OA components. The volatility distribution and chemical aging of biomass burning OA (BBOA) were simulated based on recent laboratory measurements. PMCAMx-SR was applied to Europe during an early summer period (129 May 2008) and a winter period (25 February22 March 2009). During the early summer, the contribution of biomass burning (both primary and secondary species) to total OA levels over continental Europe was estimated to be approximately 16 %. During winter the contribution was nearly 47 %, due to both extensive residential wood combustion but also wildfires in Portugal and Spain. The intermediate volatility compounds (IVOCs) with effective saturation concentration values of 105 and 106 ?gm3 are predicted to contribute around one third of the BBOA during the summer and 15% during the winter by forming secondary OA (SOA). The uncertain emissions of these compounds and their SOA formation potential require additional attention. Evaluation of PMCAMx-SR predictions against aerosol mass spectrometer measurements in several sites around Europe suggests reasonably good performance for OA (fractional bias less than 35% and fractional error less than 50 %). The performance was weaker during the winter suggesting uncertainties in residential heating emissions and the simulation of the resulting BBOA in this season. © Author(s) 2019.",,,,
Acetone Atmospheric Distribution Retrieved From Space,"As one of the most abundant oxygenated volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, acetone (CH3C[O]CH3) influences atmospheric oxidants levels and ozone formation. Here we report the first unambiguous identification of acetone from the nadir-viewing satellite sounder Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). Via a neural network-based retrieval approach that was previously applied to the retrieval of other weak absorbers, we obtain daily global acetone retrievals. A first intercomparison with independent measurements is conducted. As the retrieval method is computationally fast, it allowed the full reprocessing of the 2007–2018 IASI time series. Analysis of the retrieved global product and its seasonality suggests that emissions of acetone and precursors from the terrestrial biosphere at Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes are the main contributors to the atmospheric acetone abundance, more than year-round oxidation of anthropogenic isoalkanes. Remarkably, biomass burning does not appear to be a strong global source of acetone. ©2019. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",,,,
"Oak Savannas in Western New York State, Circa 1795: Synthesizing Predictive Spatial Models and Historical Accounts to Understand Environmental and Native American Influences","This study models and maps oak savanna distribution ca. 1795 and determines how environmental conditions and Native American land use (NALU) shaped its distribution. Historical research has analyzed early landscape accounts to assess how Native Americans modified forests throughout the eastern United States. Predictive spatial modeling has sought to quantify anthropogenic and environmental drivers of forest conditions and to predict locations where NALU changed forest composition. Yet, studies have not rigorously synthesized these two methods. This research focused on oak savannas in western New York State (27,617 km2). We trained models of oak savanna distribution from historic vegetation data in relation to environmental predictors and NALU proxies. We then mapped historical accounts of oak savannas and NALU at European-American arrival and compared them to model predictions. Results suggest that 2 to 17 percent (depending on modeling technique) of the study area contained oak savanna, with a favored estimate of 3 to 6 percent. Synthesis of models and accounts suggests that oak savannas were attributable to NALU and dry environmental conditions but that NALU (specifically burning) was present at most oak savanna locations. Models of oak savanna distribution that considered proximity to Native American settlement had higher predictive performance and better predicted locations of historical oak savanna accounts, including those with descriptions of Native American burning. This study suggests that former oak savannas in the study area can be largely attributed to NALU. Furthermore, this study’s methodology and results contribute to a larger body of geographical literature on savanna landscapes.

Production of Secondary Organic Aerosol During Aging of Biomass Burning Smoke From Fresh Fuels and Its Relationship to VOC Precursors,"After smoke from burning biomass is emitted into the atmosphere, chemical and physical processes change the composition and amount of organic aerosol present in the aged, diluted plume. During the fourth Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment, we performed smog-chamber experiments to investigate formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and multiphase oxidation of primary organic aerosol (POA). We simulated atmospheric aging of diluted smoke from a variety of biomass fuels while measuring particle composition using high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometry. We quantified SOA formation using a tracer ion for low-volatility POA as a reference standard (akin to a naturally occurring internal standard). These smoke aging experiments revealed variable organic aerosol (OA) enhancements, even for smoke from similar fuels and aging mechanisms. This variable OA enhancement correlated well with measured differences in the amounts of emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that could subsequently be oxidized to form SOA. For some aging experiments, we were able to predict the SOA production to within a factor of 2 using a fuel-specific VOC emission inventory that was scaled by burn-specific toluene measurements. For fires of coniferous fuels that were dominated by needle burning, volatile biogenic compounds were the dominant precursor class. For wiregrass fires, furans were the dominant SOA precursors. We used a POA tracer ion to calculate the amount of mass lost due to gas-phase oxidation and subsequent volatilization of semivolatile POA. Less than 5% of the POA mass was lost via multiphase oxidation-driven evaporation during up to 2 hr of equivalent atmospheric oxidation. ©2019. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",,,,
Positive matrix factorization of organic aerosol: Insights from a chemical transport model,"Factor analysis of aerosol mass spectrometer measurements (organic aerosol mass spectra) is often used to determine the sources of organic aerosol (OA). In this study we aim to gain insights regarding the ability of positive matrix factorization (PMF) to identify and quantify the OA sources accurately. We performed PMF and multilinear engine (ME-2) analysis on the predictions of a state-of-the-art chemical transport model (PMCAMx-SR, Particulate Matter Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions - source resolved) during a photochemically active period for specific sites in Europe in an effort to interpret the diverse factors usually identified by PMF analysis of field measurements. Our analysis used the predicted concentrations of 27 OA components, assuming that each of them is ""chemically different"" from the others. The PMF results based on the chemical transport model predictions are quite consistent (same number of factors and source types) with those of the analysis of AMS measurements. The estimated uncertainty of the contribution of fresh biomass burning is less than 30% and of the other primary sources less than 40 %, when these sources contribute more than 20% to the total OA. The PMF uncertainty increases for smaller source contributions, reaching a factor of 2 or even 3 for sources which contribute less than 10% to the OA. One of the major questions in PMF analysis of AMS measurements concerns the sources of the two or more oxygenated OA (OOA) factors often reported in field studies. Our analysis suggests that these factors include secondary OA compounds from a variety of anthropogenic and biogenic sources and do not correspond to specific sources. Their characterization in the literature as low-and high-volatility factors is probably misleading, because they have overlapping volatility distributions. However, the average volatility of the one often characterized as a low-volatility factor is indeed lower than that of the other (high-volatility factor). Based on the analysis of the PMCAMx-SR predictions, the first oxygenated OA factor includes mainly highly aged OA transported from outside Europe, but also highly aged secondary OA from precursors emitted in Europe. The second oxygenated OA factor contains fresher secondary organic aerosol from volatile, semivolatile, and intermediate volatility anthropogenic and biogenic organic compounds. The exact contribution of these OA components to each OA factor depends on the site and the prevailing meteorology during the analysis period. © Author(s) 2019.",,,,
Quantification of carbonaceous aerosol emissions from cookstoves in Senegal,"In some regions of the world, cooking with solid biomass fuels in open fires constitutes the largest source of elemental and organic carbon emissions. However, cooking-related carbonaceous aerosols are still poorly characterized. This paper presents an innovative characterization of elemental and organic carbon (EC and OC) emissions from cookstoves in West Africa. Four stove types (three-stone fire, rocket stove, basic ceramic stove, and gasifier) using two wood species (dimb and filao) were analyzed on a laboratory scale. The EC and OC emission factors based on fuel energy (EFs) when burning dimb were higher for all stoves, highlighting the need to account for the fuel type when reporting cookstove EFs. The highest EC EF was found for the rocket stove (0.18 ± 0.06 g MJ–1 and 0.06 ± 0.01 g MJ–1 for dimb and filao, respectively). The other tested stoves exhibited the same EC EF when burning dimb (0.09 ± 0.02 g MJ–1) and EC EFs ranging between 0.04 ± 0.01 and 0.05 ± 0.01 g MJ–1 when burning filao. The OC EF was highest, on average, for the gasifier (0.08 ± 0.01 g MJ–1), followed by those for the three-stone fire (0.18 ± 0.03 g MJ–1) and the basic ceramic stove (0.21 ± 0.08 g MJ–1). However, the results from testing the rocket stove and the three-stone fire under real cooking conditions using dimb wood indicate that the laboratory-scale tests overestimate the actual EC EFs. Also, the rocket stove did not show a reduction in wood use compared to the three-stone fire, suggesting that the carbonaceous aerosol emissions from the former produce more warming than those from the latter. Therefore, the total EC and OC stove emissions, in addition to the EFs, must be reported. As the impacts of carbonaceous aerosol highly depend on the location of emission, this study contributes valuable data to emission inventories and climate prediction models at national and regional levels. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.",,,,
Snow Albedo Reduction in Central Andes by Atmospheric Aerosols: Case Study on the Tunuyán Basin (Argentina),"Changes in snow albedo (SA) on several basins of the central Andes of Argentina are associated with the possible deposition of light-absorbing particles (LAP) in the austral spring. To demonstrate this possibility, we correlate SA with daily data of snow cover (SC), aerosol optical depth (AOD) and land surface temperature (LST) available from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board NASA Terra satellite during 2000-2016, and other derived parameters such as days after albedo (DAS) and snow precipitation (SP) from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). We used satellite pixels with 100% snow cover to obtain monthly average value of SA, LST, AOD, DAS and SP performing multiple regression analysis. Further, we analysed biomass burning emissions in northem Argentina using MODIS products MCD64 collection C6 as possible source for snow pollution. Aerosol deposition and trajectories were analysed using WRF-Chem atmospheric numerical prediction model, with inventories of regional anthropogenic emissions of own elaboration (lat. 0.025°x long. 0.025°) and the estimation of open burning emissions from the FINN global inventory (Fire INventory from NCAR).  © 2020 IEEE.",,,,
Fermentative production of soluble phosphorus fertilizer using paddy straw: an alternate to biomass burning,"To mitigate environmental impacts caused by illegal burning of paddy straw or stubble in the open fields, an alternate and economical technology for microbial degradation of lignocellulosic biomass and production of soluble phosphorus fertilizer was explored. Low-grade Mussoorie rock phosphate and Udaipur rock phosphate supplemented paddy straw was exploited as solid-state fermentation medium for the fungal-mediated release of soluble phosphorus by phosphate dissolving and cellulase producing strains of Aspergillus niger (ITCC 6719) and Aspergillus awamori (F18). Optimization of process parameters revealed that elemental composition of rock phosphate and its dose are important to affect the per cent yield of soluble phosphorus. Addition of ammonium sulphate or ammonium nitrate or urea to rock phosphate supplemented paddy straw inhibited the release of soluble phosphorus. Contrarily, adding 10% wheat bran (w/w) into paddy straw-rock phosphate mixture and its subsequent fungal inoculation at 10% (v/w) resulted in maximum solubilization (37–38%) of rock phosphate on 21st day of incubation. The fermented extract of this mixture also recorded the highest cellulase activity titre (76.32 IU ml−1) after 3 weeks of fermentation. Soil–plant interaction studies with wheat crop revealed that application of this fermented mixture to soil not only improved the plant biomass but also increased the soil available phosphorus content by ~ twofold, compared to treatments receiving recommended chemical phosphorus. Bio-processing of rock phosphate using wheat bran-amended paddy straw as fermentation substrate can provide an economical and alternate soluble fertilizer for enhanced crop phosphorus nutrition. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).",,,,
Comparison of modeled and measured ice nucleating particle composition in a cirrus cloud,"The contribution of heterogeneous ice nucleation to the formation of cirrus cloud ice crystals is still not well quantified. This results in large uncertainties when predicting cirrus radiative effects and their role in Earth's climate system. The goal of this case study is to simulate the composition, and thus activation conditions, of ice nucleating particles (INPs) to evaluate their contribution to heterogeneous cirrus ice formation in relation to homogeneous ice nucleation. For this, the regional model COSMO-Aerosols and Reactive Trace Gases (COSMO-ART) was used to simulate a synoptic cirrus cloud over Texas on 13 April 2011. The simulated INP composition was then compared to measured ice residual particle (IRP) composition from the actual event obtained during the NASA Midlatitude Airborne Cirrus Properties Experiment (MACPEX) aircraft campaign. These IRP measurements indicated that the dominance of heterogeneous ice nucleation was mainly driven by mineral dust with contributions from a variety of other particle types. Applying realistic activation thresholds and concentrations of airborne transported mineral dust and biomass-burning particles, the model implementing the heterogeneous ice nucleation parameterization scheme of Ullrich et al. is able to reproduce the overall dominating ice formation mechanism in contrast to the model simulation with the scheme of Phillips et al. However, the model showed flaws in reproducing the IRP composition. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.",,,,
Influence of herbaceous biomass ash pre-treated by alkali metal leaching on the agglomeration/sintering and corrosion behaviors,"Partially melted ash particles cause increased ash fouling, agglomeration and sintering behaviors during biomass combustion. In addition, ash fouling facilitates the corrosion behavior of stainless steel. In this work, the agglomeration/sintering and corrosion behaviors of untreated herbaceous biomass ash and that pre-treated by an alkali metal leaching reaction were investigated under combustion conditions. Although the ash agglomeration tendency increased with increasing temperature, the tendency was reduced by alkali metal leaching pre-treatment. During comparison of sintering behavior, the degree of sintering (x/r) increased as a function of time but was substantially alleviated by alkali metal leaching pre-treatment. In comparison to the typical Frenkel sintering model, a modified Frenkel sintering model was shown to fit well with the experimental sintering behavior. Alkali metal leaching pre-treatment inhibited ash particle adhesion and made high melting temperature minerals, which was verified by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, the use of ternary mineral phase diagrams and adoption of a new chemical classification system. Furthermore, from SEM-EDX, alkali metal leaching pre-treatment was seen to reduce the corrosion by ash fouling on stainless steel (SUS) 316. Resultingly, the alkali metal leaching pre-treatment significantly alleviated the ash adhesion and corrosion behaviors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,,

Since the species forming large part of the aerosol mass were strongly correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r                             s                              > 0.80), the variability of PM                             2.5                              and PM                             10                              concentration was mainly driven by the local meteorology or regional and/or long range transport. PM                             10                              mass closure was calculated based on analytical results with the average percentage of recalculated mass of 77 ± 19% in Prague-Libuš and 86 ± 16% in Prague-Suchdol. The most abundant groups in PM                             10                              at both sites during the four seasons were OM (Prague-Libuš 34% and Prague-Suchdol 37%) and SIA (Prague-Libuš 30% and Prague-Suchdol 34%). The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was applied to the chemical composition of PM                             10                              from both sites (124 samples) together to determine its sources. The nine factors were assigned as: mixed factor secondary sulphate and biomass burning, secondary sulphate, traffic, secondary nitrate, road dust, residential heating, aged sea salt, industry and mixed factor road salt along with aged sea salt. According to the polar plots and ventilation index (VI) east/west classification analysis the sources were separated based on origin to four categories local, urban agglomeration, regional and long range transport (LRT). The mixed source secondary sulphate and biomass burning, residential heating and industry were common sources of local origin at both sites. Prague-Suchdol was influenced by traffic related pollution from the urban agglomeration more than Prague-Libuš where the traffic and road dust/salt were of local origin. The regional pollution by secondary sulphates and nitrate was also relevant at both sites along with long range transport of sea salt from North Atlantic Ocean, Norwegian Sea and North Sea. The contribution of the local sources to PM                             10                              was significant mainly at Prague-Libuš site. However, the sources of regional origin were also important and influence of urban agglomeration pollution to PM                             10                              is not negligible as well.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
Organic tracers from biomass burning in snow from the coast to the ice sheet summit of East Antarctica,"Biomass burning is a significant process in the Earth system, driving ecosystem dynamics and changes in global vegetation, and affecting the carbon cycle and climate. Projections of future fire activities require an understanding of the connection between fire history and climate in the past. Polar snow/ice contain long-term records of past climates and fire activity and hold great promise to improve our understanding of wildfire patterns. Here, using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry techniques, we quantified three organic compounds (levoglucosan, vanillic, and syringic acids) released by biomass burning in snow samples collected along a 1250-km transect from the coast to the ice sheet summit Dome A in East Antarctica. Results indicate that these tracers are ubiquitous and have reached the ice sheet summit from the continental emissions in the Southern Hemisphere. These compounds showed high levels close to the coastal areas and decreased to a low level on the Antarctic plateau. The snow samples had similar levoglucosan/vanillic acid (∼45) and levoglucosan/syringic acid ratios (∼243) as aerosols from biomass burning. Multivariate analysis indicates that these compounds were likely derived from the burning of grasses and evergreen broadleaf trees that are widespread in Southern Hemisphere than from evergreen conifers that dominate northern hemisphere fire-prone ecosystems. Snow accumulation rate influenced the levels of these compounds, while coexisting ions had little effect on compound contents in the snow. The low concentrations of levoglucosan at inland sites (mean of 2.7 pg mL−1; versus 3.5 and 3.7 pg mL−1 in coastal and transition zones, respectively) could be associated with the oxidation by OH radicals under sunlight. Our analysis demonstrated that the ubiquity of multiple biomarkers from biomass burning in East Antarctic surface snow can provide baseline concentrations for future studies in Antarctica. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
"Mineralogical, chemical and leaching characteristics of ashes from residential biomass combustion","Four types of pellets and three agro-fuels were chemically characterised and burned in a pellet stove. To assess the influence of the material composing the firebox and the combustion efficiency of distinct biomass heating devices in the composition of the bottom ashes, three of the pellets were also burned in a conventional woodstove and in a fireplace. Ashes were analysed for their C, H and N contents by an elemental analyser, whilst major and trace elements were quantified by inductively coupled plasma atomic-emission spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, respectively. The mineralogy of ashes was determined by X-ray powder diffraction. The European standard test was applied to samples to determine the leaching potential of major, minor and trace elements. The contents of major and trace elements in the different types of biomass presented enormous variations, which are reflected in dissimilar mineralogical and chemical compositions of the respective ashes. The leachable potential of several elements of environmental concern present in oxy-anionic form at the alkaline pH of biomass ashes were generally high in all samples. Concentrations of some elements in the leachates were in the range of values with classification of “hazardous materials” by the European legislation in what respects the acceptance of these wastes at landfills. Pellets made up of wood wastes and containing preservatives (chromated copper arsenate and ammoniacal copper arsenate) are of concern. Due to lower combustion efficiencies, the leachable potential for most of the trace elements in ashes from the woodstove, and especially from the fireplace, was lower than that of the pellet stove. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,,,
Haze effects on satellite remote sensing imagery and their corrections,"Imagery recorded using satellite sensors operating at visible wavelengths can be contaminated by atmospheric haze that originates from large scale biomass burning. Such issue can reduce the reliability of the imagery and therefore having an effective method for removing such contamination is crucial. The principal aim of this study is to investigate the effects of haze on remote sensing imagery and develop a method for removing them. In order to get a better understanding on the behaviour of haze, the effects of haze on satellite imagery were initially studied. A methodology of removing haze based on haze subtraction and filtering was then developed. The developed haze removal method was then evaluated by means of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and classification accuracy. The results show that the haze removal method is able to improve the haze-affected imagery qualitatively and quantitatively. © 2019 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.",,,,
Developing a fuzzy-model with particle swarm optimization-based for improving the conversion and gasification rate of palm kernel shell,"Biomass steam gasification is a promising technology for syngas production. This study focused on the effect of different gasification parameters like temperature (°C), CaO/biomass, particle size, and coal bottom ash (wt%), on the conversion and gasification rate via steam gasification using palm kernel shell (PKS) as feedstock. The essential goal is to maximize the conversion and gasification rates of the PKS steam gasification system by deciding the optimum operating parameters using particle swarm optimization. The PKS gasification model was developed using a fuzzy logic approach. Gasification temperature, coal bottom ash percentage, CaO/biomass ratio, and PKS particle size; are the four variables of decisions used in the optimization process. The findings were compared with the experimental data at optimal conditions and those expected via the methodology of response surface (RSM) approach. The proposed strategy provided optimum conditions of a temperature of 750 °C, the particle size of 0.5 mm, CaO/biomass ratio of 1.36, and coal bottom ash of 0.0337 wt%, for a conversion rate of 89.25%, and a gasification rate of 85.51%, which is 10% higher than those obtained experimentally. The current research work was able to predict the optimal conditions for the enhancement of conversion and gasification rate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Understanding the effects of grazing and prescribed fire on hydrology of Kentucky bluegrass-dominated rangelands in the northern Great Plains,"According to National Resources Inventory data, Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) is now present in over 85% of the areas sampled. This invasive, perennial, cool season grass can serve to stabilize soils and increase site stability; however, it also alters nutrient flows, soil structure, and plant community composition, ultimately degrading biotic integrity. In addition, Kentucky bluegrass alters the hydrologic function of an area by changing root structure and the way in which water flow is captured and released back into the ecosystem. To clarify the effect of Kentucky bluegrass on hydrological characteristics of invaded sites, rainfall simulation experiments and hydrophobicity measurements with water drop infiltration time and molarity of ethanol droplet tests were conducted at three locations all within the same ecological site in the northern Great Plains. Rainfall simulation experiments were performed on 24 large plots (6 × 2 m) at 63.5 mm h-1 and 127 mm h-1 intensities and on 16 small plots (0.7 × 0.7 m) at 63.5 mm h-1 and 103 mm h-1. Rainfall was maintained on the large plots until 10 minutes of steady-state runoff was measured or for a maximum of 30 minutes in the absence of runoff, while on the small plots, rainfall duration was set at 25 minutes. The soil layer was divided into four strata (litter, thatch, root mat, and mineral soil), which were physically separated for their hydrophobic behavior in laboratory and field water drop penetration tests and molarity analyses. Our results indicate that on dry soil strata, water drop penetration time increased by 20 seconds on litter and 3 seconds on thatch for every percentage point increase in Kentucky bluegrass in the vegetation, confirming the close association between this grass species and the development of soil hydrophobicity. Rainfall simulation on dry soils (less than 20% volumetric water content) also revealed that the time needed to initiate runoff was shortened by 5 minutes, and the runoff ratio increased by 0.004 for every percentage point increase of Kentucky bluegrass in the vegetation cover. Hydrophobicity dramatically declined in the thatch layer by a factor of 4 and was completely absent from the litter layer after wetting. In contrast to the rainfall simulations on dry soils, wet runs (volumetric water content ≥20%) showed a beneficial effect of Kentucky bluegrass on hydrologic response with delayed runoff by 5 minutes and reduced runoff ratios by 0.003 for 1% increase in Kentucky bluegrass in the vegetation cover. Prescribed fire increased litter hydrophobicity, but this did not adversely affect hydrologic response. This study highlights the need for further research contrasting detrimental effects of Kentucky bluegrass on hydrologic response in dry soil conditions with the beneficial effect of this grass on infiltration under wet conditions to better predict the overall ecohydrological outcome of an invasion by this grass species. © 2019 Soil Conservation Society of America.

Predicting and analyzing the performance of biomass-burning natural draft rocket cookstoves using computational fluid dynamics,"Nearly three billion people in the world today rely on biomass for their cooking needs. Indoor cooking using biomass has been identified as a major cause of respiratory illnesses, resulting in four million premature deaths every year. Improved biomass cookstoves may help mitigate this challenge. This paper presents a two-dimensional axisymmetric steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a biomass burning, natural draft rocket cookstove. The CFD model includes coupled sub-models representing combustion, turbulence, and heat transfer. The model is validated against experimental data and used to predict temperatures and flow inside the cookstove, including the airflow rate through the cookstove and heat transfer to the cookpot. We find that the excess air is typically many times stoichiometric air during standard operating conditions and is sensitive to flow field obstructions. We analyze the effects of geometric and operational features such as the pot support height, secondary air entrainment, cone-deck shape, and baffle placement within the cookstove on the flow, airflow rate, mixing, and stove thermal efficiency. The model shows that secondary air entrainment, though ineffective by itself, increases turbulent mixing when used in conjunction with a central baffle but reduces thermal efficiencies due to enhanced heat transfer to the walls. We find that a lower pot support height decreases the airflow rate and increases thermal efficiency. We model thirty-six cone-deck configurations and find that the cone-deck shape primarily affects the airflow rate through the stove, with more constricted designs leading to higher thermal efficiencies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
"A 16,000-year record of climate, vegetation and fire from Wallacean lowland tropical forests","The tropical forests of Sulawesi represent some of the most diverse, biogeographically significant ecosystems globally. However, long-term ecological data for the region are scarce, making it difficult to predict vegetation response to future climatic and anthropogenic drivers of change. This is problematic as gauging the acclimation thresholds of forests within tropical Asia has been identified as an IPCC policy imperative. This study uses palynological and geochemical analysis of sediments from a tectonic basin – Lake Lantoa – to reconstruct the hydroclimatic, fire, and tropical rainforest dynamics of south Sulawesi over 16,000 years, and reveal the response of lowland ultramafic forest to large-scale environmental change. Our results show that the Late Pleistocene was characterised by a drier, more seasonal climate and persistent fire in the landscape. These conditions supported a slightly open, Gymnostoma-rich, semi-seasonal forest, and constrained the available habitat range for hydrophilic tropical conifers. Increased effective moisture in the Holocene, interpreted from the onset of periodic lake stratification under deeper conditions, appears to have precluded forest burning, and facilitated the expansion of a lowland ultramafic rainforest and upland tropical coniferous forest. An increase in garden/secondary forest taxa and ground ferns from ∼2 cal kyrs BP implies increased human management of the landscape. While these data highlight the compositional dynamism of lowland forest in Wallacea to seasonality, fire, and reduced precipitation, they demonstrate biome-scale resilience to glacial-scale environmental change. This contrasts with interpretations of forest sensitivity to climatic change drawn from analysis of leaf wax isotopes from adjacent lake basins, highlighting the value of adopting multi-proxy, taxonomically high-resolution techniques for reconstructing floristic histories. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Theoretical model and preliminary design of an innovative wet scrubber for the separation of fine particulate matter produced by biomass combustion in small size boilers,"Fine particulate matter (PM) emission from biomass boilers for non-industrial heating represents one of the most important causes (together with the transport sector) of air pollution, in particular during winter. Separation technologies for fine PM are already well-known and adopted on an industrial scale, as a consequence of strict limits set by national and international regulations. On domestic boilers, the same technologies utilized on an industrial scale are not feasible due to high investment costs. Moreover, the emission limits for small size biomass boilers are higher than for industrial boilers, so high efficiency separation technologies are not needed, and are sometimes not present at all. The main goal of the paper is the development and testing of a mathematical model that is able to foresee the PM removal efficiency of a wet scrubber device. After an experimental validation based on several tests, it was possible to approach the preliminary design of an innovative wet scrubber, which is described in the paper. The main characteristics are (i) removal efficiency over 99.9%, (ii) specific energy consumption under 36 kJ m−3, which is an industrial reference, and (iii) relatively low investment, operation and maintenance costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,,,

Inflammation is a common and essential event in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases. Decades of research has converged on an understanding that all combustion-derived particulate matter (PM) is inflammatory to some extent in the lungs and also systemically, substantially explaining a significant portion of the massive cardiopulmonary disease burden associated with these exposures. In general, this means that efforts to do the following can all be beneficial: reduce particulates at the source, decrease the inflammatory potential of PM output, and, where PM inhalation is unavoidable, administer anti-inflammatory treatment. A range of research, including basic illumination of inflammatory pathways, assessment of disease burden in large cohorts, tailored treatment trials, and epidemiologic, animal, and in vitro studies, is highlighted in this review. However, meaningful translation of this research to decrease the burden of disease and deliver a clear and cohesive message to guide daily clinical practice remains rudimentary. Ongoing efforts to better understand substantial differences in the concentration and type of PM to which the global community is exposed and then distill how that influences inflammation promises to have real-world benefit. This review addresses this complex topic in 3 sections, including ambient PM (typically associated with ground-level transportation), wildfire-induced PM, and PM from indoor biomass burning. Recognizing the overlap between these domains, we also describe differences and suggest future directions to better inform clinical practice and public health. © 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",,,,
The influence of solvent and pH on determination of the light absorption properties of water-soluble brown carbon,"Brown carbon (BrC) is a class of unidentified organic compounds that efficiently absorb solar radiation in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, and its effects on climate are poorly understood. Measurement of the light absorption properties of BrC in liquid extracts is a commonly used BrC analytical method, but the optical characteristics of water-soluble BrC may be affected by pH and solvent. In this work, we investigated the effects of concentration, pH, and solvent on water-soluble BrC from ambient aerosols, biomass burning, diesel exhaust, and a humic substance standard. The results showed that pH can affect the light absorption properties of water-soluble BrC, whereas concentration had little effect, except low concentrations dissolved in methanol. Therefore, the pH of humic-like substances (HULIS) should be adjusted to the same value as water-soluble carbon (WSOC) for calculating the light-absorption contribution of HULIS to WSOC. The light absorptivity of water-soluble BrC dissolved in methanol was higher than that in water. Considering the pH and concentration effects, extraction of WSOC with a particle: water ratio of 0.25 mg/mL is proposed as well as to get a reference pH for light absorption analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Regional impact of biomass burning in southeast Asia on atmospheric aerosols during the 2013 seven South-East Asian studies project,"A nested air quality prediction modeling system (NAQPMS) with an online tracer-tagged module was utilized to investigate the regional impact of biomass burning (BB) on aerosols and source–receptor relationships in Southeast Asia during March–April 2013. NAQPMS could reproduce the three-dimensional spatial distribution of aerosols. Both monthly and episodic analyses indicated that BB significantly contributed to surface and column aerosol concentrations in Southeast Asia along two long-range transport pathways. In the first pathway, aerosols from BB were blown northward from the Indochina peninsula to southwestern provinces in China. The mean contributions of BB decreased from 70%– 80% in the source regions to 10%–40% in southwestern China. Myanmar was the largest exporter. In the second pathway, PM2.5 emitted by BB was uplifted into the mid-altitudes (2000 m) in the Indochina peninsula and transported eastward to the western Pacific at altitudes of 2500–4000 m, passing the South China Sea, southern China and western Pacific. In downwind regions, BB contributed 30%–60% of aerosols at altitudes of 2000–4000 m and 10%–30% below 2000 m. A simple estimation based on source–receptor relationships showed that BB emissions were likely overestimated by 35%– 50% in the Fire Inventory from National Center for Atmospheric Research (v1.5). © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.",,,,
Global fire history of grassland biomes,"Grasslands are globally extensive; they exist in many different climates, at high and low elevations, on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils. Grassland distributions today are closely linked to human activities, herbivores, and fire, but many have been converted to urban areas, forests, or agriculture fields. Roughly 80% of fires globally occur in grasslands each year, making fire a critical process in grassland dynamics. Yet, little is known about the long-term history of fire in grasslands. Here, we analyze sedimentary archives to reconstruct grassland fire histories during the Holocene. Given that grassland locations change over time, we compare several charcoal-based fire reconstructions based on alternative classification schemes: (a) sites from modern grassland locations; (b) sites that were likely grasslands during the mid-Holocene; and (c) sites based on author-derived classifications. We also compare fire histories from grassland sites, forested sites, and all sites globally over the past 12,000 years. Forested versus grassland sites show different trends: grassland burning increased from the early to mid-Holocene, reaching a maximum about 8000–6000 years ago, and subsequently declined, reaching a minimum around 4000 years ago. In contrast, biomass burning in forests increased during the Holocene until about 2000 years ago. Continental grassland fire history reconstructions show opposing Holocene trends in North versus South America, whereas grassland burning in Australia was highly variable in the early Holocene and much more stable after the mid-Holocene. The sharp differences in continental as well as forest versus grassland Holocene fire history trajectories have important implications for our understanding of global biomass burning and its emissions, the global carbon cycle, biodiversity, conservation, and land management. © 2018 The Authors.

Resolving anthropogenic aerosol pollution types - Deconvolution and exploratory classification of pollution events,"Mass spectrometric measurements commonly yield data on hundreds of variables over thousands of points in time. Refining and synthesizing this raw data into chemical information necessitates the use of advanced, statistics-based data analytical techniques. In the field of analytical aerosol chemistry, statistical, dimensionality reductive methods have become widespread in the last decade, yet comparable advanced chemometric techniques for data classification and identification remain marginal. Here we present an example of combining data dimensionality reduction (factorization) with exploratory classification (clustering), and show that the results cannot only reproduce and corroborate earlier findings, but also complement and broaden our current perspectives on aerosol chemical classification. We find that applying positive matrix factorization to extract spectral characteristics of the organic component of air pollution plumes, together with an unsupervised clustering algorithm, k-means+ + , for classification, reproduces classical organic aerosol speciation schemes. Applying appropriately chosen metrics for spectral dissimilarity along with optimized data weighting, the source-specific pollution characteristics can be statistically resolved even for spectrally very similar aerosol types, such as different combustion-related anthropogenic aerosol species and atmospheric aerosols with similar degree of oxidation. In addition to the typical oxidation level and source-driven aerosol classification, we were also able to classify and characterize outlier groups that would likely be disregarded in a more conventional analysis. Evaluating solution quality for the classification also provides means to assess the performance of mass spectral similarity metrics and optimize weighting for mass spectral variables. This facilitates algorithm-based evaluation of aerosol spectra, which may prove invaluable for future development of automatic methods for spectra identification and classification. Robust, statistics-based results and data visualizations also provide important clues to a human analyst on the existence and chemical interpretation of data structures. Applying these methods to a test set of data, aerosol mass spectrometric data of organic aerosol from a boreal forest site, yielded five to seven different recurring pollution types from various sources, including traffic, cooking, biomass burning and nearby sawmills. Additionally, three distinct, minor pollution types were discovered and identified as amine-dominated aerosols. © Author(s) 2017.",,,,
Seasonal assessment and classification of aerosols transported to Lahore using AERONET and MODIS deep blue retrievals,"Daily measurements of aerosol optical depth (τ) and Ångstrom wavelength exponent (α) acquired from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) are analysed over Lahore – an urban city of Pakistan (period: 2010–2014) to investigate contribution of different types of aerosols originating from both local and regional source locations. The obtained annual averages (mean ± standard deviation) for AERONET retrievals of τ (500 nm) and α (440–870 nm) are 0.68 ± 0.37 (0.08–2.91) and 0.99 ± 0.33 (0–1.8), respectively. Of all the sources, 61% are found within Pakistan, 11% in India, 19% in Afghanistan, 6% in Iran and 2% in Saudi Arabia with seasonal contributions of 35, 25, 23 and 17% in pre-monsoon, monsoon, winter and post-monsoon, respectively. The bimodal distributions of α show dominance of coarse-mode particles during pre-monsoon, fine-mode particles during post-monsoon and presence of both coarse-mode and fine-mode particles during winter and monsoon with winter showing more fine-mode particles. Two broad classes of aerosols namely desert dust (DD) and biomass burning/urban industrial (BU) are identified with criteria, e.g. τ ≥ 0.3 and α ≤ 0.75 indicating presence of DD while τ ≥ 0.2 and α ≥ 1.15 indicating BU. The frequency of occurrence (FOO) of DD and BU aerosols is further identified by applying classification criteria over Aqua-MODIS deep blue retrievals. The FOO identifies anthropogenic activity on-going throughout the year, disrupted with DD aerosols only during pre-monsoon and monsoon. The maximum dust activity is seen over Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) (localized maxima: 35–45%) and the Arabian peninsula (>55%) during pre-monsoon, while maximum BU aerosols are found over IGP, central and south-eastern plains of India and the state of Gujarat (localized maxima: >70%) in winter and post-monsoon. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society",,,,
Classification of aerosol over central Europe by cluster analysis of aerosol columnar optical properties and backward trajectory statistics,"A cluster analysis is applied to the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data obtained at Belsk, Poland, as well as three nearby Central European stations (Leipzig, Minsk and Moldova) for estimation of atmospheric aerosol types. Absorption Ångstrom exponent (AAE), aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and extinction Ångstrom exponent (EAE) parameters are used. Clustering in both 2D (AOT, EAE) and 3D (AOT, EAE, AAE) is investigated. A method of air mass backward trajectory analysis is then proposed, with the receptor site at Belsk, to determine possible source regions for each cluster. Four dominant aerosol source regions are identified. The biomass burning aerosol source is localized in the vicinity of Belarusian-Ukrainian border. Slovakia and northern Hungary are found to be the source of urban/industrial pollutants. Western Poland and eastern Germany are the main sources of polluted continental aerosols. The most differentiated source region of Scandinavia, Baltic Sea and Northern Atlantic, associated with lowest values of AOT, corresponds to clean continental and possibly maritime type aerosols. © 2016 Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences 2016.",,,,
Quantification of amine functional groups and their influence on OM/OC in the IMPROVE network,"Recently, we developed a method using FT-IR spectroscopy coupled with partial least squares (PLS) regression to measure the four most abundant organic functional groups, aliphatic C-H, alcohol OH, carboxylic acid OH and carbonyl C=O, in atmospheric particulate matter. These functional groups are summed to estimate organic matter (OM) while the carbon from the functional groups is summed to estimate organic carbon (OC). With this method, OM and OM/OC can be estimated for each sample rather than relying on one assumed value to convert OC measurements to OM. This study continues the development of the FT-IR and PLS method for estimating OM and OM/OC by including the amine functional group. Amines are ubiquitous in the atmosphere and come from motor vehicle exhaust, animal husbandry, biomass burning, and vegetation among other sources. In this study, calibration standards for amines are produced by aerosolizing individual amine compounds and collecting them on PTFE filters using an IMPROVE sampler, thereby mimicking the filter media and collection geometry of ambient standards. The moles of amine functional group on each standard and a narrow range of amine-specific wavenumbers in the FT-IR spectra (wavenumber range 1 550–1 500 cm−1) are used to develop a PLS calibration model. The PLS model is validated using three methods: prediction of a set of laboratory standards not included in the model, a peak height analysis and a PLS model with a broader wavenumber range. The model is then applied to the ambient samples collected throughout 2013 from 16 IMPROVE sites in the USA. Urban sites have higher amine concentrations than most rural sites, but amine functional groups account for a lower fraction of OM at urban sites. Amine concentrations, contributions to OM and seasonality vary by site and sample. Amine has a small impact on the annual average OM/OC for urban sites, but for some rural sites including amine in the OM/OC calculations increased OM/OC by 0.1 or more. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Holocene black carbon in Antarctica paralleled Southern Hemisphere climate,"Black carbon (BC) and other biomass-burning (BB) aerosols are critical components of climate forcing, but quantification, predictive climate modeling, and policy decisions have been hampered by limited understanding of the climate drivers of BB and by the lack of long-term records. Prior modeling studies suggested that increased Northern Hemisphere anthropogenic BC emissions increased recent temperatures and regional precipitation, including a northward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Two Antarctic ice cores were analyzed for BC, and the longest record shows that the highest BC deposition during the Holocene occurred ~8-6 k years before present in a period of relatively high austral burning season and low growing season insolation. Atmospheric transport modeling suggests South America (SA) as the dominant source of modern Antarctic BC and, consistent with the ice core record, climate model experiments using mid-Holocene and preindustrial insolation simulate comparable increases in carbon loss due to fires in SA during the mid-Holocene. SA climate proxies document a northward shifted ITCZ and weakened SA Summer Monsoon (SASM) during this period, with associated impacts on hydroclimate and burning. A second Antarctic ice core spanning the last 2.5 k years documents similar linkages between hydroclimate and BC, with the lowest deposition during the Little Ice Age characterized by a southerly shifted ITCZ and strengthened SASM. These new results indicate that insolation-driven changes in SA hydroclimate and BB, likely linked to the position of the ITCZ, modulated Antarctic BC deposition during most of the Holocene and suggests connections and feedbacks between future BC emissions and hydroclimate. Plain Language Summary Future anthropogenic-driven climate change may impact wildfires, yet predictions are hampered by few long-term records of natural wildfires, particularly for the Southern Hemisphere. We document large variations in black carbon deposition during the past 14,000 years from an Antarctic ice core. Black carbon is a tracer for wildfires and is a significant climate forcing agent. We show that black carbon in Antarctica closely followed Southern Hemisphere hydroclimate and strength of the South American Summer Monsoon. With future predictions showing significant low-latitude changes in precipitation under increased emissions, the climate-fire linkages presented here suggest future changes to South American biomass burning. © 2017.

Assessing the spatial fidelity of sedimentary charcoal size fractions as fire history proxies with a high-resolution sediment record and historical data,"Fire reconstructions provide context for modern rates of burning and inform predictions of fire regimes’ responses to climate and/or ecological changes. Charcoal particles preserved in lake sediments are a widely employed fire proxy. Although many studies have calibrated the charcoal proxy, the spatial scales of charcoal dispersal and source area remain disputed. Understanding the spatial fidelity of charcoal accumulation is increasingly important in light of recent efforts to aggregate multiple charcoal records to infer changes in regional, continental- and global-scale fire regimes. Using a high-resolution sediment record from Swamp Lake, California, we compare charcoal accumulation rate (CHAR) variations of three size fractions of sedimentary charcoal (63–150, >150, and >250 μm) to historical area burned data. We find that macroscopic (>250 and >150 μm) and mesoscopic (63–150 μm) charcoal source areas are within 25, 35, and 150 km of Swamp Lake, respectively. We also use a dispersal model to confirm these findings. Our estimates of charcoal source area fall within the large range of estimates for forest fires in the literature. Further, our methodology shows potential for constraining source areas of charcoal in sedimentary records, which is requisite for the reliable inference of the spatial extent of fire in paleorecords. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,,,
A burned area mapping algorithm for Chinese FengYun-3 MERSI satellite data,"Biomass burning is a worldwide phenomenon, which emits large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and strongly influences the environment. Burned area is an important parameter in modeling the impacts of biomass burning on the climate and ecosystem. The Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) onboard FengYun-3C (FY-3C) has shown great potential for burned area mapping research, but there is still a lack of relevant studies and applications. This paper describes an automated burned area mapping algorithm that was developed using daily MERSI data. The algorithm employs time-series analysis and multi-temporal 1000-m resolution data to obtain seed pixels. To identify the burned pixels automatically, region growing and Support Vector Machine) methods have been used together with 250-m resolution data. The algorithm was tested by applying it in two experimental areas, and the accuracy of the results was evaluated by comparing them to reference burned area maps, which were interpreted manually using Landsat 8 OLI data and the MODIS MCD64A1 burned area product. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm was able to improve the burned area mapping accuracy at the two study sites. © 2017 by the authors.",,,,
On the effect of live fuel moisture content on fire rate of spread,"Aim of study: To reconcile the effects of live fuel moisture content (FMC) on fire rate of spread (ROS) derived from laboratory and field fires. Methods: The analysis builds on evidence from previous fire-spread experimental studies and on a comparison between two functions for the FMC damping effect: one derived from field burns, based on dead FMC, and another derived from laboratory trials, based on a weighted FMC (dead and live fuels). Main results: In a typical Mediterranean shrubland, laboratory and field-derived FMC damping functions are linearly related, which is explained by the correlation between monthly average live and dead FMC variation throughout the year. This clarifies why the effect of live FMC on real-world fires ROS has remained elusive, although in fact it has an influence. Research highlights: By providing evidence that the most significant effect of FMC on ROS is independent of vegetation phenology (dead or live condition), and explaining why in specific situations dead FMC is sufficient to provide satisfactory ROS predictions, our results can assist future modelling efforts. © 2017 INIA.",,,,
Morphochemical characteristics and mixing state of long range transported wildfire particles at Ny-Ålesund (Svalbard Islands),"A prolonged and exceptionally intense air mass advection event transporting biomass burning aerosols generated in Alaska affected Ny-Ålesund in the mid of July 2015. This paper reports the morphochemical characteristics and mixing state of individual aerosol particles collected during the event. To this aim aerosol samples were collected on nucleopore polycarbonate membrane filters using a DEKATI 12-stage low volume impactor and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Results of SEM investigations depict a complex aerosol characterized by an external mixing between a main part of carbonaceous organic particles (tar balls and organic particles), lower ammonium sulfate and minor potassium chloride and mineral dust amounts. The carbonaceous particles are spherical to slightly elongated and the organic particles show an internal mixing of low density organics and/or ammonium sulfate upon denser nuclei. Most particles are in the accumulation mode size range although the size and the morphology of the chloride and the sulfate salts evidence the growth of these species both in the air and upon the sampling membranes. Individual particle analyses were complemented by aerosol size distribution (Aerodynamic Particle Sizer, Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer) and optical (Particle Soot Absorption Photometer, nephelometer) measurements at ground level in order to retrieve the optical and radiative properties of the aerosol in the atmosphere and to predict the fate and behaviour of particles upon deposition at ground level. Individual particle analyses were also compared with bulk chemical analyses on daily sampling filters and back-trajectory analyses of the air mass movement in order to enucleate distinct sources of the aerosol during the long range transport. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Classification of aerosol over central Europe by cluster analysis of aerosol columnar optical properties & backward trajectory statistics,"A cluster analysis is applied to the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data obtained at Belsk, Poland, as well as three nearby Central European stations (Leipzig, Minsk and Moldova) for estimation of atmospheric aerosol types. Absorption Ångstrom exponent (AAE), aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and extinction Ångstrom exponent (EAE) parameters are used. Clustering in both 2D (AOT, EAE) and 3D (AOT, EAE, AAE) is investigated. A method of air mass backward trajectory analysis is then proposed, with the receptor site at Belsk, to determine possible source regions for each cluster. Four dominant aerosol source regions are identified. The biomass burning aerosol source is localized in the vicinity of Belarusian-Ukrainian border. Slovakia and northern Hungary are found to be the source of urban/industrial pollutants. Western Poland and eastern Germany are the main sources of polluted continental aerosols. The most differentiated source region of Scandinavia, Baltic Sea and Northern Atlantic, associated with lowest values of AOT, corresponds to clean continental and possibly maritime type aerosols. © 2016 Szkop et al.

Ammonia emissions from biomass burning in the continental United States,"This study quantifies ammonia (NH3) emissions from biomass burning from 2005 to 2015 across the continental US (CONUS) and compares emissions from biomass burning with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Emissions Inventory (NEI), the Fire Inventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (FINN) and the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). A statistical regression model was developed in order to predict NH3 emissions from biomass burning using a combination of fire properties and meteorological data. Satellite data were used to evaluate the annual fire strength and frequency as well as to calculate the total NH3 emissions across the CONUS. The results of this study showed the total fire number has decreased, while the total yearly burn area and the average fire radiative power has increased. The average annual NH3 emissions from biomass burning from this study, on a national scale, were approximately 5.4e8 ± 3.3e8 kg year−1. When comparing the results of this study with other emission inventories, it was found that ammonia emissions estimated by the NEI were approximately a factor of 1.3 lower than what was calculated in this study and a factor of 1.1 lower than what was modeled using the statistical regression model for 2010–2014. The calculated NH3 emissions from biomass burning were a factor of 5.9 and a factor of 13.1 higher than the emissions from FINN and the GFED, respectively. The modeled NH3 emissions from biomass burning were a factor of 5.0 and a factor of 11.1 higher than the emissions from FINN and the GFED, respectively. As the climate continues to change, the pattern (frequency, intensity and magnitude) of fires across the US will also change, leading to changes in NH3 emissions. The statistical regression model developed in this study will allow prediction of NH3 emissions associated with climate change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
Understanding the Southeast Asian haze,"The Southeast Asian region had been subjected to a drastic reduction in air quality from the biomass burnings that occurred in 2013 and 2015. The smoke from the biomass burnings covered the entire region including Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, with haze particulate matter (PM) reducing the air quality to hazardous levels. Here we report a comprehensive size-composition-morphology characterization of the PM collected from an urban site in Singapore during the two haze events. The two haze events were a result of biomass burning and occurred in two different geographical source regions. We show the similarities and variations of particle size distribution during hazy and clear days during the two haze events. Sub-micron particles (<1 μm) dominate (∼50%) the aerosols in the atmosphere during clear and hazy days. Using electron microscopy, we also categorize the PM, namely soot, organic-inorganic clusters and hybrid particles. The composition and morphology were similar in both the haze events. The majority of the PM is composed of carbon (∼51%) and other elements pertaining to the earth's crust. The complexity of the mixing state of the PM is highlighted and the role of the capture mode is addressed. We also present the morphological characterization of all the classified PM. The box counting method is used to determine the fractal dimensions of the PM, and the dimensionality varied for every classification from 1.79 to 1.88. We also report the complexities of particles and inconsistencies in the existing approaches to understand them. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,
The Climatology of Australian Aerosol,"Airborne particles or aerosols have long been recognised for their major contribution to uncertainty in climate change. In addition, aerosol amounts must be known for accurate atmospheric correction of remotely sensed images, and are required to accurately gauge the available solar resource. However, despite great advances in surface networks and satellite retrievals over recent years, long-term continental-scale aerosol data sets are lacking. Here we present an aerosol assessment over Australia based on combined sun photometer measurements from the Bureau of Meteorology Radiation Network and CSIRO/AeroSpan. The measurements are continental in coverage, comprising 22 stations, and generally decadal in timescale, totalling 207 station-years. Monthly climatologies are given at all stations. Spectral decomposition shows that the time series can be represented as a weighted sum of sinusoids with periods of 12, 6 and 4 months, corresponding to the annual cycle and its second and third harmonics. Their relative amplitudes and phase relationships lead to sawtooth-like waveforms sharply rising to an austral spring peak, with a slower decline often including a secondary peak during the summer. The amplitude and phase of these periodic components show significant regional change across the continent. Fits based on this harmonic analysis are used to separate the periodic and episodic components of the aerosol time series. An exploratory classification of the aerosol types is undertaken based on (a) the relative periodic amplitudes of the Ångström exponent and aerosol optical depth, (b) the relative amplitudes of the 6- and 4-month harmonic components of the aerosol optical depth, and (c) the ratio of episodic to periodic variation in aerosol optical depth. It is shown that Australian aerosol can be broadly grouped into three classes: tropical, arid and temperate. Statistically significant decadal trends are found at 4 of the 22 stations. Despite the apparently small associated declining trends in mid-visible aerosol optical depth of between 0.001 and 0.002 per year, these trends are much larger than those projected to occur due to declining emissions of anthropogenic aerosols from the Northern Hemisphere. There is remarkable long-range coherence in the aerosol cycle across the continent, suggesting broadly similar source characteristics, including a possible role for intercontinental transport of biomass burning aerosol. © Author(s) 2017.",,,,
Chemical transport model simulations of organic aerosol in southern California: Model evaluation and gasoline and diesel source contributions,"Gasoline- and diesel-fueled engines are ubiquitous sources of air pollution in urban environments. They emit both primary particulate matter and precursor gases that react to form secondary particulate matter in the atmosphere. In this work, we updated the organic aerosol module and organic emissions inventory of a three-dimensional chemical transport model, the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ), using recent, experimentally derived inputs and parameterizations for mobile sources. The updated model included a revised volatile organic compound (VOC) speciation for mobile sources and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from unspeciated intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs). The updated model was used to simulate air quality in southern California during May and June 2010, when the California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) study was conducted. Compared to the Traditional version of CMAQ, which is commonly used for regulatory applications, the updated model did not significantly alter the predicted organic aerosol (OA) mass concentrations but did substantially improve predictions of OA sources and composition (e.g., POA-SOA split), as well as ambient IVOC concentrations. The updated model, despite substantial differences in emissions and chemistry, performed similar to a recently released research version of CMAQ (Woody et al., 2016) that did not include the updated VOC and IVOC emissions and SOA data. Mobile sources were predicted to contribute 30-40% of the OA in southern California (half of which was SOA), making mobile sources the single largest source contributor to OA in southern California. The remainder of the OA was attributed to non-mobile anthropogenic sources (e.g., cooking, biomass burning) with biogenic sources contributing to less than 5% to the total OA. Gasoline sources were predicted to contribute about 13 times more OA than diesel sources; this difference was driven by differences in SOA production. Model predictions highlighted the need to better constrain multi-generational oxidation reactions in chemical transport models.",,,,
Absorption of chemically aged biomass burning carbonaceous aerosol,"Smog chamber experiments were conducted to study the changes of the physical properties and chemical composition of biomass burning particles as they evolve in the atmosphere. A Soot Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SP-AMS) and a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) were used for the chemical characterization of the particles. An Aethalometer and a green and a blue photoacoustic extinctiometer (PAX) were used for the study of the aerosol optical properties. As smoke aged, exposed to UV light, ozone or OH radicals, organic material condensed on the preexisting particles. This coating led to an increase of the absorption of the black carbon-containing particles by as much as a factor of two. The absorption enhancement of biomass burning particles due to their coating with aromatic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) was also studied. The resulting absorption enhancement was determined mainly by the changes in the SOA mass concentration and not the changes of its oxygen to carbon ratio. The measured absorption enhancements were consistent with the predictions of Mie theory assuming core-shell morphology for the aged particles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,,,
1-octanol-water partitioning as a classifier of water soluble organic matters: Implication for solubility distribution,"Water-soluble organic matters (WSOMs) play an important role in determining magnitudes of climatic and environmental impacts of organic aerosol particles because of their contributions to hygroscopic growth and cloud formation. These processes are dependent on water solubility as well as distribution of this property in a particle, yet no method has been available to quantify such characteristics. In this study, we developed a theoretical framework to classify WSOM by 1-octanol-water partitioning that has a strong correlation with water solubility. 1-octanol-water partitioning coefficient also has a strong correlation with a traditional solid phase extraction method, facilitating interpretation of data from the technique. The theoretical analysis demonstrated that the distributions of WSOM classified by 1-octanol-water partitioning depend on (1) the volume ratio of 1-octanol and aqueous phases, and (2) extraction steps. The method was tested by using organic aerosol particles generated by smoldering of a mosquito coil, which serves as a surrogate for biomass burning particles. The WSOM extracted from the mosquito coil burning particles was classified by 1-octanol-water partitioning at different volume ratios. These solutions, including both the 1-octanol and aqueous phases, were nebulized to generate particles for measurements using an online aerosol mass spectrometer. The mass spectra indicated that highly oxygenated species tend to be highly soluble, while high molecular weight compounds are less soluble. Linear combinations of these mass spectra allowed the estimation of the mass fractions of WSOM partitioned to 1-octanol and aqueous phases, thereby facilitating the evaluation of the mass fractions of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) active materials. © 2017 American Association for Aerosol Research. © 2017 American Association for Aerosol Research.",,,,
Paleoecological and sedimentological data from: “A classification for macroscopic charcoal morphologiefound in holocene lacustrine sediments”,"This dataset contains sedimentological and paleoenvironmental measurements from a 351.5 cm sediment core that was collected from Pyatts Lake, south-east British Columbia, Canada. Sedimentological data include: radiocarbon dates and age-depth model, magnetic susceptibility, loss-on-ignition values, and particle size distributions. Palaeoecological data include: macroscopic charcoal (>150 µm), charcoal morphotypes; aquatic macroremains; pollen spectra, conifer stomata, microscopic charcoal and total fungal spores. These data were used to investigate the potential for charcoal morphotype assemblages for paleoenvironmental interpretations in montane mixed conifer forests. These data were collected from analytical laboratory and optical microscopy analyses. Data are presented in a multiple tabbed spreadsheet. These data can be used for direct comparison with other sedimentological, vegetation, and disturbance histories during the Holocene and may be compared to prior geologic time periods in an analogue context. The charcoal data can be applied to syntheses of biomass burning from local to global scales and pollen data can be combined into pollen database analyses. © 2015 The Author(s).",,,,
Spatio-temporal analysis of biomass burning in insular Southeast Asia using empirical orthogonal function (EOF),"The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) technique is used to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of fires in insular Southeast Asia.

Detailed source-specific molecular composition of ambient aerosol organic matter using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and 1H NMR,"Organic aerosols (OA) are universally regarded as an important component of the atmosphere that have far-ranging impacts on climate forcing and human health. Many of these impacts are related to OA molecular characteristics. Despite the acknowledged importance, current uncertainties related to the source apportionment of molecular properties and environmental impacts make it difficult to confidently predict the net impacts of OA. Here we evaluate the specific molecular compounds as well as bulk structural properties of total suspended particulates in ambient OA collected from key emission sources (marine, biomass burning, and urban) using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (UHR-MS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). UHR-MS and 1H NMR show that OA within each source is structurally diverse, and the molecular characteristics are described in detail. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that (1) aromatic nitrogen species are distinguishing components for these biomass burning aerosols; (2) these urban aerosols are distinguished by having formulas with high O/C ratios and lesser aromatic and condensed aromatic formulas; and (3) these marine aerosols are distinguished by lipid-like compounds of likely marine biological origin. This study provides a unique qualitative approach for enhancing the chemical characterization of OA necessary for molecular source apportionment. © 2016 by the authors.",,,,
Effects of soil nitrogen availability and native grass diversity on exotic forb dominance,"Exotic plants are often most successful in high resource environments. By drawing down available resources, species-rich communities may be able to reduce exotic success when resource supply is elevated. We tested the prediction that exotic success would be greatest in species-poor communities when nitrogen availability is high. We also tested two underlying assumptions of this prediction: species-rich communities draw down soil nitrogen availability more than species-poor communities following fertilization and exotic success increases when soil nitrogen availability is high. In a restored grassland where native grass diversity was manipulated (one, three, or five-species) seven years earlier to form a gradient in species richness, we manipulated nitrogen availability directly via fertilization, and indirectly via burning. We then examined the success of the exotic forb Galium verum L. Contrary to our prediction, diversity and nutrient treatments did not jointly influence exotic success. Instead, one-time fertilization increased exotic biomass in the first year of the study. This likely occurred because the effect of nutrient treatments on nitrogen availability was independent of diversity treatment. Thus, we found no evidence that species-rich communities are better able to reduce exotic biomass when nitrogen is added than are species-poor communities. This suggests that in some systems, the effects of increasing species richness can be overwhelmed by the effects of nutrient addition that promote exotic success. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,,
Characteristics and seasonal variation of carbonaceous and water soluble organic components in the aerosols over East India,"The present investigation intends to measurement of PM2.5 and PM10 samples from agricultural (AG) and an Adityapur industrial (AI) site of East India to better characterize the carbonecous and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC). The current study aimed (a) to determine variation ratio of OC/PM, EC/PM, WSOC/EC, OC/EC in the study area (b) assess and quantity the Correlation between OC and EC, WSOC and OC, WSOC and PM, WSOC and EC of AG and AI site (c) Analyse the abundance pattern, at AG site indicating dominant contribution from biomass burning sources (wood-fuel and agriculture waste) and in AI site sharp contrast influenced by emissions from coal-fired industries.

Sources and characteristics of fine particles over the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea using online single particle aerosol mass spectrometer,"Marine aerosols over the East China Seas are heavily polluted by continental sources. During the Chinese Comprehensive Ocean Experiment in November 2012, size and mass spectra of individual atmospheric particles in the size range from 0.2 to 2.0. μm were measured on board by a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS). The average hourly particle number (PN) was around 4560 ± 3240 in the South Yellow Sea (SYS), 2900 ± 3970 in the North Yellow Sea (NYS), and 1700 ± 2220 in the Bohai Sea (BS). PN in NYS and BS varied greatly over 3 orders of magnitude, while that in SYS varied slightly. The size distributions were fitted with two log-normal modes. Accumulation mode dominated in NYS and BS, especially during episodic periods. Coarse mode particles played an important role in SYS. Particles were classified using an adaptive resonance theory based neural network algorithm (ART-2a). Six particle types were identified with secondary-containing, aged sea-salt, soot-like, biomass burning, fresh sea-salt, and lead-containing particles accounting for 32%, 21%, 18%, 16%, 4%, and 3% of total PN, respectively. Aerosols in BS were relatively enriched in particles from anthropogenic sources compared to SYS, probably due to emissions from more developed upwind regions and indicating stronger influence of continental outflow on marine environment. Variation of source types depended mainly on origins of transported air masses. This study examined rapid changes in PN, size distribution and source types of fine particles in marine atmospheres. It also demonstrated the effectiveness of high-time-resolution source apportionment by ART-2a. © 2015.",,,,
"Aerosol optical properties under the condition of heavy haze over an urban site of Beijing, China","In January 2013, several serious haze pollution events happened in North China. Cimel sunphotometer measurements at an urban site of Beijing (Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences—CAMS) from 1 to 30 January 2013 were used to investigate the detailed variation of aerosol optical properties. It was found that Angstrom exponents were mostly larger than 0.80 when aerosol optical depth values are higher than 0.60 at the urban region of Beijing during January 2013. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) at the urban region of Beijing can remain steady at approximately 0.40 before haze happening and then increased sharply to more than 1.50 at 500 nm with the onset of haze, which suggests that the fine-mode AOD is a factor of 20 of the coarse-mode AOD during a serious haze pollution event. The single scattering albedo was approximately 0.90 ± 0.03 at 440, 675, 870 and 1,020 nm during the haze pollution period. The single scattering albedo at 440 nm as a function of the fine-mode fraction was relatively consistent, but it was highly variable at 675, 870 and 1,020 nm. Except on January 12 and 18, all the fine-mode particle volumes were larger than those of coarse particles, which suggests that fine particles from anthropogenic activities made up most of the haze. Aerosol type classification analysis showed that the dominant aerosol types can be classified as both “mixed” and “urban/industrial (U/I) and biomass burning (BB)” categories during the heavy haze period of Beijing in January of 2013. The mixed category occurrence was about 31 %, while the U/I and BB was about 69 %. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,,
Source attribution of aerosol size distributions and model evaluation using Whistler Mountain measurements and GEOS-Chem-TOMAS simulations,"Remote and free-tropospheric aerosols represent a large fraction of the climatic influence of aerosols; however, aerosol in these regions is less characterized than those polluted boundary layers. We evaluate aerosol size distributions predicted by the GEOS-Chem-TOMAS global chemical transport model with online aerosol microphysics using measurements from the peak of Whistler Mountain, British Columbia, Canada (2182gmga.s.l., hereafter referred to as Whistler Peak). We evaluate the model for predictions of aerosol number, size, and composition during periods of free-tropospheric (FT) and boundary-layer (BL) influence at ""coarse"" 4&deg;g × g5&deg; and ""nested"" 0.5&deg;g × g0.667&deg; resolutions by developing simple FT/BL filtering techniques. We find that using temperature as a proxy for upslope flow (BL influence) improved the model-measurement comparisons. The best threshold temperature was around 2 &deg;C for the coarse simulations and around 6 &deg;C for the nested simulations, with temperatures warmer than the threshold indicating boundary-layer air. Additionally, the site was increasingly likely to be in cloud when the measured relative humidity (RH) was above 90g %, so we do not compare the modeled and measured size distributions during these periods. With the inclusion of these temperature and RH filtering techniques, the model-measurement comparisons improved significantly. The slope of the regression for N80 (the total number of particles with particle diameter, Dp, &gt; g80gnm) in the nested simulations increased from 0.09 to 0.65, R2 increased from 0.04 to 0.46, and log-mean bias improved from 0.95 to 0.07. We also perform simulations at the nested resolution without Asian anthropogenic emissions and without biomass-burning emissions to quantify the contribution of these sources to aerosols at Whistler Peak (through comparison with simulations with these emissions on). The long-range transport of Asian anthropogenic aerosol was found to be significant throughout all particle number concentrations, and increased N80 by more than 50g%, while decreasing the number of smaller particles because of suppression of new-particle formation and enhanced coagulation sink. Similarly, biomass burning influenced Whistler Peak during summer months, with an increase in N80 exceeding 5000gcm&minus;3. Occasionally, Whistler Peak experienced N80g &gt; g1000gcm&minus;3 without significant influence from Asian anthropogenic or biomass-burning aerosol. Air masses were advected at low elevations through forested valleys during times when temperature and downwelling insolation were high, ideal conditions for formation of large sources of low-volatility biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This condensable material increased particle growth and hence N80. The low-cost filtering techniques and source apportionment used in this study can be used in other global models to give insight into the sources and processes that shape the aerosol at mountain sites, leading to a better understanding of mountain meteorology and chemistry. © Author(s) 2016.",,,,
Experimentally measured morphology of biomass burning aerosol and its impacts on CCN ability,"This study examines the morphological properties of freshly emitted and atmospherically aged aerosols from biomass burning. The impacts of particle morphology assumptions on hygroscopic predictions are examined. Chamber experiments were conducted at the University of California, Riverside, Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT) atmospheric processes lab using two biomass fuel sources: manzanita and chamise. Morphological data was obtained through the use of an aerosol particle mass analyzer (APM), scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) system and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Data from these instruments was used to calculate both a dynamic shape factor and a fractal-like dimension for the biomass burning emissions. This data was then used with &kappa;-Köhler theory to adjust the calculated hygroscopicity for experimentally determined morphological characteristics of the aerosol. Laboratory measurement of biomass burning aerosol from two chaparral fuels show that particles are nonspherical with dynamic shape factors greater than 1.15 for aerosol sizes relevant to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation. Accounting for particle morphology can shift the hygroscopicity parameter by 0.15 or more. To our knowledge, this work provides the first laboratory chamber measurements of morphological characteristics for biomass burning cloud condensation nuclei and provides experimental particle shape evidence to support the variation in reported hygroscopicities of the complex aerosol. © 2015 Author(s).",,,,
A review of hygroscopic growth factors of submicron aerosols from different sources and its implication for calculation of lung deposition efficiency of ambient aerosols,"Hygroscopic properties are an important parameter in determining the atmospheric behaviour of aerosols and their optical properties, influencing the direct and indirect effect of aerosols upon climate. As a result, particle hygroscopicity has received much attention with a rapid increase of publications in recent years. Likewise, hygroscopicity is an important characteristic influencing the deposition efficiency of particles in the human respiratory tract by affecting the particle size. The object of this study is to review the existing knowledge on the hygroscopic growth factor (Gf) of atmospheric submicron particles and its influence on the lung deposition calculation. The study briefly reviews first the Gf values of particles generated from various sources, including nucleation, traffic emissions and biomass burning, discussing the spatial and temporal variations. It then summarises Gf values of submicron particles and number fraction of each hygroscopic group measured in different ambient environments. These include marine, roadside, urban background and rural environments. The study concludes by estimating the lung deposition efficiency of ambient particles using a modified version of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) model for hygroscopic particles. Furthermore, the effect of hygroscopicity on lung deposition efficiency of ambient particles has been estimated. The ICRP model seems to predict well the deposition efficiency (DE) values for small ambient particles in the extra-thoracic and tracheo-bronchial region, but not the alveolar region, where they are overestimated. However, for larger particles (Dp > 200 nm), the ICRP model underestimates the DE values, with the extra-thoracic region the most affected of the three. Hygroscopic atmospheric particles with a small diameter (Dp < 200 nm) showed a lower total lung deposition than hydrophobic particles of the same initial size due to their hygroscopic properties. On the other hand, larger hygroscopic particles (Dp > 200 nm) showed much higher lung deposition than hydrophobic particles. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,,
"Experimental model validation and thermodynamic assessment on high percentage (up to 70%) biomass co-gasification at the 253 MWe integrated gasification combined cycle power plant in Buggenum, The Netherlands","High percentage (up to 70% energy based) biomass co-gasification tests have been carried out at the 253 MWe coal based Willem-Alexander Centrale (WAC), Buggenum in The Netherlands utilizing steam exploded wood pellets to assess feasibility of scaling up and to address stringent EU emission requirements in the coming decades. This principal article for demonstrating high percentage biomass co-gasification in large scale IGCC power plants, presents the obtained experimental results with a detailed and validated steady state thermodynamic model developed as an aid to assess future plant operations. The validated model is also used to predict plant performance involving 70% co-gasification with two fuel blends of torrefied wood pellets since the desired power output of 230 MWe could not be achieved with steam exploded wood pellets. The model predicts plant performance and process parameters with reasonable accuracy and gives a net power output of 173 MW and a net plant efficiency of about 37.2% with steam exploded wood pellets. A net output of 240 MWe and net plant efficiency of 41.7% is predicted for 70% co-gasification with high lower heating value (LHV) torrefied wood pellets. Exergy analysis indicates largest thermodynamic losses in the gasifier and during combustion, providing additional scope for efficiency enhancement. The demonstration of such a high percentage biomass co-gasification test at a large scale power plant is of vital importance for further development of low emission/carbon neutral power plants. The presented test data also serves as a reliable and prime data source for modeling studies. The validated models could serve as a strong platform to plan real plant operation with various biofuels and carry out studies involving novel technology integration, retrofitting and plant optimization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,
Identification of columnar aerosol types under high aerosol optical depth conditions for a single AERONET site in Korea,"Dominant aerosol types were classified using level 2 inversion products for the Anmyon Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site in Korea for the period 1999–2007. The aerosol types were mineral dust (MD), MD mixed with carbon, and black carbon mixed coarse particles (BCCP) for coarse mode aerosols, black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), and secondary inorganic ions (SII) for fine mode aerosols, and mixed particles between. The classification was carried out using a clustering method based on parameters, including single scattering albedo (SSA), absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE), and fine mode volume fraction (FMVF). Among the seven aerosol types, MD was distinct, with the highest AAE and a very low FMVF and SII with the highest SSA and FMVF. BCCP was introduced to designate coarse particles mixed with BC, of which the AAE was lower than 1, despite a low FMVF. In addition to a large difference in AAE between BC and OC, the SSA of OC was larger than that of BC, indicating the effects of the white smoke produced from the smoldering phase of biomass burning. Monthly variations of the aerosol types were well interpreted by meteorology and emissions and coincided with those in the previous studies. Applying our results to well-characterized global AERONET sites, we confirmed that the aerosol types at Anmyon were valid at other sites. However, the results also showed that the mean properties for aerosol types were influenced by the specific aerosols prevalent at the study sites. © 2016. American Geophysical Union.

"Aerosol chemical profile of near-source biomass burning smoke in sonla, vietnam during 7-SEAS campaigns in 2012 and 2013","This study aimed to investigate aerosol chemical characteristics and to obtain the chemical profile of near-source biomass burning (BB) aerosols at a site (675 m a.s.l.) in Sonla, Northern Vietnam. Particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) was collected over a 24 h sampling period as part of the Seven South East Asian Studies (7-SEAS) campaign. The studies were conducted when BB was highly active — that is, in the spring of 2012 and 2013. The collected particles were analyzed for carbonaceous fractions and water-soluble components, in addition to the mass concentration. Data obtained were further analyzed to determine the stable species profile by classifying the 5-day air-mass backward trajectories. The average PM2.5 mass concentrations were 51 ± 19 μg m–3 and 57 ± 27 μg m–3 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Carbonaceous contents dominated BB aerosol, with 59% ± 9% and 58% ± 9% in organic carbon (OC) and 9% ± 3% and 10% ± 3% in elemental carbon (EC) of PM2.5 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Of the 8 carbonaceous fractions analyzed thermo-optically for PM2.5, OC3 (evolution temperature at 280°C–480°C) was most abundant in OC fractions, and EC1-OP (elemental carbon evolved at 580°C minus the pyrolized OC fractions) was predominant in EC fractions in most occasions. Among the measured water-soluble inorganic ions, NH4 + and SO4                             2- widely varied, indicating the influence of different trajectory origins. This finding was confirmed by trajectory classification of aerosol data. The trajectories were also distinguished with respect to char-EC to soot-EC ratio, and water-soluble OC. These characteristics were highest in the trajectory from the BB source area. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.",,,,
"Comprehensive PM2.5 organic molecular composition and stable carbon isotope ratios at Sonla, Vietnam: Fingerprint of biomass burning components","This study presents measurements of aerosol chemical properties at Sonla, northern Vietnam (675 m a.s.l.) during spring time, when biomass burning (BB) was very active in the northern Indochina Peninsula, as part of the 7-SEAS (Seven South East Asian Studies) campaign in 2013. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of BB markers in 14 selected samples indicated that mixed softwood, hardwood, grass, and non-woody vegetation were burned. More than 50 organic compounds including levoglucosan, lignin and resin products, sugar and sugar alcohol compounds, fatty acids, phthalate esters, aromatic acids, poly-acids, and biogenic oxidation products (e.g., 2-methyltetrols, alkene triols, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid) were measured in PM2.5. Levoglucosan, a BB tracer, was the predominant species among aerosol sugars, with an average concentration of 1.62 ± 0.89 μg m–3, comprising 2.23 ± 0.5% of PM2.5 mass. For the collection period of the selected samples, backward air mass trajectories were classified into the source regions of Indochina (BBIC), southern China (BBSC), and the South China Sea (BBSS). All resolved molecular compounds show their dominance on the trajectory from BBIC, verifying the BB smoke origin of that region. Trajectory classification provides additional information, such as higher level of diethyl phthalate associated with BBSC trajectory, revealing urban or industrial influence, and more low-molecular-weight than high-molecular-weight fatty acids, indicating distributions with more microbial and lesser plant wax/vegetation burning contributions along the BBSC trajectory. In addition, we report, for the first time, stable carbon isotopic data (δ13C) for PM2.5 aerosols in northern Vietnam, which ranged from –26.6 to –25.4‰ in PM2.5, indicating contributions from burning of C3 plants and fossil fuel combustion. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.",,,,
