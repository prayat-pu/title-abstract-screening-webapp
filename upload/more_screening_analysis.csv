Blockchain-based isotopic big data-driven tracing of global PM sources and interventions,"Tracing sources and assessing intervention effectiveness are crucial for controlling atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution. Isotopic techniques enable precise top-down tracing, but the absence of long-term, global-scale multi-compound isotopic data limits comprehensive analysis. Here, we establish a blockchain-based isotopic database, compiling 34,815 isotopic fingerprints of global PM and its emissions from 1,890 pollution events across 66 countries. This allows retrospective analysis and predictions, revealing that PM sources are distinct, dynamically changing over time, and often asynchronous with interventions. Additionally, we estimate source contributions to PM2.5 and its compounds, highlighting the increasing impact of biomass burning. Furthermore, projections indicate that by 2100, PM levels may decline to 5.38 Â± 0.16 Î¼g/mÂ³ in the Americas and 13.9 Â± 1.82 Î¼g/mÂ³ in Asia under climate mitigation scenarios but will still exceed WHO guidelines without further controls on natural emissions. Guiding future interventions with isotopic big data is essential for addressing air pollution challenges. Â© The Author(s) 2025.",
Using AOD and UVAI to Reduce the Uncertainties in Wildfire Emission and Air Quality Modeling,"Wildfires are a major natural source of atmospheric aerosols, leading to air quality degradation and adverse human health effects. Accurate prediction of air quality effects from wildfires remains challenging due to uncertainties in fire emission estimates. To enhance the accuracy of fire emissions used in air quality forecast models, we developed a method that utilizes satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations and air quality simulations to calculate dynamic emission scaling factors and improve wildfire air quality forecasts. TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) UV Aerosol Index (UVAI) data are employed to fill AOD gaps under thick smoke using two approaches: a regression model and an artificial intelligence model. The scaling factor method was applied to NOAA blended Global Biomass Burning Emissions Product. The emission scaling factors exhibited significant variability across different fire points, highlighting the need for point-specific scaling factors. On average, scaling factors were less than 1.0 (indicating emission overestimation) during the initial stages of fire events but exceeded 1.0 (suggesting underestimation) after 7Â days of fire duration. An inverse relationship between scaling factors and fire radiative power (FRP) was observed, with emission underestimation for low-intensity fires (FRP <5Â MW) and substantial overestimation for high-intensity fires (FRP >500Â MW). The improved fire emissions were employed in the air quality model for the 2020 US Gigafire event. Utilizing emission scaling factors reduced model bias, increased the correlation and hit rate of PM2.5 exceedance prediction, demonstrating the potential of using emission scaling factors for improving air quality forecasting during wildfire events.

Current Status of Aerosol in the Northern Key Economic Zone of Vietnam and Identification of Region Affecting Hanoi's Air Quality,"The Northern Key Economic Zone (NKEZ) of Vietnam, a critical region for national development, experiences significant particulate matter pollution. This study investigates aerosol pollution and its transboundary effects across the NKEZ by integrating the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) dataset and the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. The results reveal: (1) Anthropogenic aerosols exhibit statistically significant upward trends (p < 0.05), with sulfate concentrations ranging from 7.59 to 9.29Â Î¼g.mâˆ’3 and organic carbon from 4.79 to 10.87Â Î¼g.mâˆ’3; (2) MERRA-2 captures PM2.5 seasonal trends, with correlation coefficients (p < 0.01) of 0.83 in spring and 0.71 in winter, though it significantly underestimates PM2.5 level in winter in Hanoi; (3) combined analyses of trajectory frequency and pollution concentration correlations delineate five levels of impact (level 1â€“5, from minimal to very high) on Hanoiâ€™s air quality and identify key black carbon (BC) source regions. These include coal-fired power plants in Thai Binh, Thanh Hoa (levels 3â€“4, in spring), biomass burning in east-northern mountainous region of Vietnam (levels 4â€“5, in autumn), biomass burning in central-southern Laos (levels 2â€“3, peak Fire Detection Counts in Marchâ€“April) and transboundary contributions from central-southern China (levels 2â€“3, in autumn). The integration of MERRA-2 and HYSPLIT establishes a robust methodology for classifying pollution sources affecting Hanoi, providing a technical framework for future regional air quality investigations.

Global Horizontal Irradiance Prediction Model Based on Mixed Spatial Information and Aerosol Classification,"Reliable and accurate predictions of solar radiation are essential for the supervision and operation of solar photovoltaic power generation systems. As the primary media involved in atmospheric radiation transfer, aerosols significantly influence global horizontal irradiance (GHI). The composition, shape, and number density distribution of aerosols vary greatly, resulting in significant differences in their optical properties, which in turn affect solar radiation in different ways. This study aims to explore the impact of different types of aerosols on predicting GHI. First, we expanded the data within a fixed region by incorporating spatial information to supplement the timescale data. Furthermore, we used the Informer model to forecast the GHI in different regions, inputting historical data on aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological parameters, and GHI. Finally, we used an aerosol classification model to classify aerosols in different regions and calculated the GHI predictions for different aerosol types. The findings suggest that aerosol classification impacts the predictive performance of the GHI. When continental and subcontinental aerosols dominated, the predictive performance of the GHI improved. When biomass-burning aerosols dominate, the predictive accuracy of the GHI reduced. Â© 2025 The Author(s).

Hybrid machine learning to enhance PM2.5 forecasting performance by the WRF-Chem model,"The weather research and forecasting with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model had been widely used in PM2.5 concentration forecasting. However, uncertainties in global emission inventories, meteorological data, and simplified chemical parameterizations continue to pose challenges. We evaluated the performance of the original WRF-Chem model and three models augmented with machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and XGBoost-LSTM (Hybrid) approaches, to enhance forecasting accuracy. The ML models were trained and tested using dataset from WRF-Chem-simulated meteorological and pollutant data at four monitoring stations in southern Thailand during the year 2019â€“2020. The WRF-Chem-Hybrid model significantly improved all metrics in the original WRF-Chem results - with R2 increasing from insignificant to 0.90 or more, RMSE decreasing from 7.00-15.17 Î¼g/m3 to 1.34â€“3.47 Î¼g/m3, and MAE decreasing from 5.52-10.55 Î¼g/m3 to 0.79â€“1.49 Î¼g/m3. The validation test during the entire 2021 performed well, with R2 = 0.94â€“0.96, RMSE = 1.56â€“2.48 Î¼g/m3 and MAE = 1.01â€“1.56 Î¼g/m3. The WRF-Chem-Hybrid model forecast PM2.5 concentrations for 72 h in advance, with R2 = 0.70â€“0.89, RMSE = 4.64â€“11.99 Î¼g/m3, and MAE = 3.07â€“8.38 Î¼g/m3. Thus, the hybrid model is suggested for forecasting PM2.5 concentrations over southern Thailand and other regions up to 72 h in advance. Overall, this study demonstrated the advantages of augmenting the WRF-Chem model to form hybrid ML models to more accurately forecast PM2.5 levels, their distribution and evolution over time, particularly in regions where PM2.5 levels were affected by open biomass burning from both local and cross-border emissions.

Interventions for reducing exposure to air pollution from landscape fires in a changing environment: A systematic review,"Emissions from more frequent and prolonged landscape fires (wildfires, risk reduction fires, agricultural burning) can expose populations to high levels of air pollution and exacerbate a range of health conditions. This systematic review aims to map, evaluate, and synthesise the scientific literature reporting interventions that can reduce exposure to landscape fire smoke (LFS). Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science and reviewed relevant literature published until March 2024. Thirty-three studies from four countries met the eligibility criteria. Of the interventions evaluated, air filtration was the most frequently reported, and included use of portable air cleaners (PACs) with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, ventilation systems with standard and upgraded filters, and low-cost fan filter units (FFU). The effectiveness of PACs for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) reduction ranged between 54 %â€“92 %. In naturally ventilated residences, concentrations of PM2.5 were 0â€“44 % lower indoors, and depended on the duration of LFS, building operation, and permeability. Mechanical ventilation with minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) 5/8 filters in buildings reduced LFS PM2.5 levels by 18â€“58 %; however, use of higher rated filters (e.g., MERV 12/13) achieved reductions of up to 87 %. Communication interventions, including smartphone apps and alerts/messages from various media sources (e.g., radio, television, internet) had mixed results; nevertheless, inclusion of spirometry and asthma control surveys during app use could improve health outcomes for vulnerable groups. The efficacy of facemasks (N95/P2) was up to 94 % for single pass PM2.5 removal, although they were relatively underutilised. Clean air shelters in public buildings can potentially provide a place for exposure reduction and social support, but have not been sufficiently tested during LFS events. Further research is needed on the effectiveness of interventions during prolonged smoke events, and in low- and middle-income countries. Â© 2025",
Sources and formation of fine size-fractionated particulate matters during smoke haze episode in Northern Thailand in relation to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and carbonaceous composition,"Air pollution in upper Southeast Asia (SEA) has become critical particularly regarding atmospheric particles. This study aims to investigate the sources and formation of fine size-fractionated particulate matters (FSPMs), as well as their potential impact on climate. Particulate matter in three size ranges (2.1â€“1.1 Î¼m, 1.1â€“0.65 Î¼m, and 0.65â€“0.43 Î¼m) was collected using cascade impactors in rural Chiang Dao (CD) and urban Chiang Mai (CM) during the smoke haze period (Marchâ€“April 2019) in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The average concentration of FSPM was approximately 1.3 times higher in rural CD (88 Â± 34 Î¼g/mÂ³) than in urban CM (66 Â± 26 Î¼g/mÂ³). Both areas showed significantly higher concentrations of finer particles, with rural CD detecting 41 Â± 17 Î¼g/mÂ³ (46% of FSPM) and urban CM presenting 27 Â± 11 Î¼g/mÂ³ (41% of FSPM). Total carbon (TC) concentrations, including organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), showed the same pattern as PMs. The most abundant fractions, including OC3 (32â€“45% of total OC) and EC1 (91â€“100% of total EC) in FSPM samples, particularly in fine particles (PM1), suggest that biomass burning was the primary source. Source classification based on diagnostic ratios of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), OC/EC ratios, combined with primary and secondary formations, revealed that PM2.1-1.1 was influenced by biomass burning and secondary organic carbon (SOC), while PM0.65-0.43 originated from both SOC and vehicular emissions. PM1.1-0.65 in the rural area was probably caused by SOC and other mixed sources, whereas SOC and vehicular emissions were the main source in urban CM. With respect to the effective carbon ratio (ECR), lower values were observed in finer particles (0.37 Â± 0.15 in rural CD and 0.36 Â± 0.38 in urban CM), suggesting enhanced light-absorbing properties of fine particulate matter during the haze period in the upper SEA region.

Aerosol Characteristics Over an Eastern Indian City Using Sun Photometer Observations and Machine Learning Frameworks,"This study focuses on aerosol properties and their classification in the eastern Indian city of Rourkela, using six years of Microtops II sun photometer data. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) exhibits unique increasing trends from 2017 to 2022, irrespective of seasons. The Ã…ngstrÃ¶m Exponent (AE) values indicate the predominance of fine-mode aerosols in winter, pre-monsoon, and post-monsoon months due to high fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions. However, a marginal drop in the AE values is seen during monsoon due to the long-range transport of coarse-mode natural aerosols from the neighboring oceans and arid regions. The single scattering albedo (SSA) values reveal a dominance of absorbing aerosols during winter and post-monsoon months, while indicating a mix of particle types in the pre-monsoon and monsoon periods. The dominance of sea salt aerosols and wet removal of finer absorbing particles during monsoon season result in higher SSA values. A shift in fine particle dominance is found in the inter-annual variabilities, wherein these particles are gradually acquiring scattering characteristics aligning with the regional trend in recent times. Aerosols are classified into urban, biomass-burning, desert, and marine types based on AOD-AE variability. The existence of biomass-burning aerosols is found to dominate over Rourkela, irrespective of seasons. While urban aerosols are usually dominant in winter and post-monsoon due to anthropogenic activities, transported desert dust aerosols show dominance during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. Long-range transport across different atmospheric levels are realized to play important role in modulating aerosol variability. The forecasted values realized through the â€˜Linear Regressionâ€™ model also indicated a similar trend for the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. However, the winter AOD values are expected to increase in the succeeding years. The research sheds light on aerosol properties, their origins, and interactions with the prevailing meteorology, and future projection, providing useful information for urban air quality management.

Effect of Biomass Burnings on Population Exposure and Health Impact at the End of 2019 Dry Season in Southeast Asia,"At the end of the dry season, from early March to early April each year, extensive agricultural biomass waste burnings occur throughout insular mainland Southeast Asia. During this biomass-burning period, smoke aerosols blanketed the whole region and were transported and dispersed by predominant westerly and southwesterly winds to southern China, Taiwan, and as far southern Japan and the Philippines. The extensive and intense burnings coincided with some wildfires in the forests due to high temperatures, making the region one of the global hot spots of biomass fires. In this study, we focus on the effect of pollutants emitted from biomass burnings in March 2019 at the height of the burning period on the exposed population and their health impact. The Weather Research Forecast-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model was used to predict the PM2.5 concentration over the simulating domain, and health impacts were then assessed on the exposed population in the four countries of Southeast Asia, namely Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Using the health impact based on log-linear concentration-response function and Integrated Exposure Response (IER), the results show that at the peak period of the burnings from 13 to 20 March 2019, Thailand experienced the highest impact, with an estimated 2170 premature deaths. Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia followed, with estimated mortalities of 277, 565, and 315 deaths, respectively. However, when considering the impact per head of population, Laos exhibited the highest impact, followed by Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The results highlight the significant health impact of agricultural waste burnings in Southeast Asia at the end of the dry season. Hence, policymakers should take these into account to design measures to reduce the negative impact of widespread burnings on the exposed population in the region. Â© 2024 by the authors.",
Biomass burning in Peninsular Southeast Asia intensifies meteorological drought in Southwest China,"Biomass burning in Peninsular Southeast Asia (BBâ€“PSEA) affects the climate in downwind regions, especially precipitation (PRE) in southern China. However, the impact of BBâ€“PSEA on the meteorological drought in Southwest China (SWC), where closes to PSEA and often occurs seasonal drought, have not been clear yet. We selected a severe drought event in SWC from January to April 2010 and conducted sensitivity simulations using WRFâ€“Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry) to evaluate the impact of BBâ€“PSEA on the meteorological drought in SWC. Comparisons with observations revealed that the model performed well in simulating the spatiotemporal evolution of the drought in SWC. BBâ€“PSEA increased the drought severity by 0.01â€“0.75 levels, enlarged drought areas by about 10%, and prolonged the drought duration mainly by one month in SWC. The impact of BBâ€“PSEA on the drought in SWC in March/April was almost tenfold that in January/February, due to the higher emissions of BBâ€“PSEA in March/April. The mechanism that BBâ€“PSEA influenced drought predominantly involved the reduction of PRE, potential evapotranspiration (PET), and moisture fluxes in SWC. BBâ€“PSEA aerosols warmed the air at 600â€“800 hPa and cooled the air near the surface in SWC, which stabilized the atmosphere and suppressed PRE and reduced PET in SWC. BBâ€“PSEA aerosols also increased the sea surface temperature in South China Sea and the geopotential heights in the north of the Bay of Bengal, where the moisture sources of SWC originated from. This perturbation reduced the moisture fluxes across the west and south boundaries of SWC, resulting in the reduction of the water vapor content and PRE in SWC. Through elucidating the impact of BBâ€“PSEA on the drought in SWC, this study clarified how BBâ€“PSEA affected the climate in the downwind region and provided new understanding for drought prediction in SWC.

A Semi-Quantitative Approach to Nontarget Compositional Analysis of Complex Samples,"Nontarget analysis (NTA) by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry improves the capacity to comprehend the molecular composition of complex mixtures compared to targeted analysis techniques. However, the detection of unknown compounds means that quantification in NTA is challenging. This study proposes a new semi-quantitative methodology for use in the NTA of organic aerosol. Quantification of unknowns is achieved using the average ionization efficiency of multiple quantification standards which elute within the same retention time window as the unknown analytes. In total, 110 authentic standards constructed 25 retention time windows for the quantification of oxygenated (CHO) and organonitrogen (CHON) species. The method was validated on extracts of biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) and compared to quantification with authentic standards and had an average prediction error of 1.52 times. Furthermore, 70% of concentrations were estimated within a factor of 2 (prediction errors between 0.5 and 2 times) from the authentic standard quantification. The semi-quantification method also showed good agreement for the quantification of CHO compounds compared to predictive ionization efficiency-based methods, whereas for CHON species, the prediction error of the semi-quantification method (1.63) was significantly lower than the predictive ionization efficiency approach (14.94). Application to BBOA for the derivation of relative abundances of CHO and CHON species showed that using peak area underestimated the relative abundance of CHO by 19% and overestimated that of CHON by 11% compared to the semi-quantification method. These differences could lead to significant misinterpretations of source apportionment in complex samples, highlighting the need to account for ionization differences in NTA approaches.

Diagnosing uncertainties in global biomass burning emission inventories and their impact on modeled air pollutants,"Large uncertainties persist within current biomass burning (BB) inventories, and the choice of these inventories can substantially impact model results when assessing the influence of BB aerosols on weather and climate. We evaluated discrepancies among BB emission inventories by comparing carbon monoxide (CO) and organic carbon (OC) emissions from seven major BB regions globally between 2013 and 2016. Mainstream bottom-up inventories, including the Fire INventory from NCAR 1.5 (FINN1.5) and Global Fire Emissions Database version 4s (GFED4s), along with the top-down inventories Quick Fire Emissions Dataset 2.5 (QFED2.5) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS-)based Fire Emission Inventory version 0 (VFEI0), were selected for this study. Global CO emissions range from 252 to 336 Tg, with regional disparities reaching up to a 6-fold difference. Dry matter is the primary contributor to the regional variation in CO emissions (50 %-80 %), with emission factors accounting for the remaining 20 %-50 %. Uncertainties in dry matter often arise from biases in calculating bottom fuel consumption and burned area, influenced by vegetation classification methods and fire detection products. In the tropics, peatlands contribute more fuel loads and higher emission factors than grasslands. At high latitudes, increased cloud fraction amplifies the discrepancy in estimated burned area (or fire radiative power) by 20 %. The global OC emissions range from 14.9 to 42.9 Tg, exhibiting higher variability than CO emissions due to the corrected emission factors in QFED2.5, with regional disparities reaching a factor of 8.7. Additionally, we applied these BB emission inventories to the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) and assessed the model performance against observations. Our results suggest that the simulations based on the GFED4s agree best with the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT-)retrieved CO. While comparing the simulation with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) aerosol optical depth (AOD), our results reveal that there is no global optimal choice for BB inventories. In the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, using GFED4s and QFED2.5 can better capture the AOD magnitude and diurnal variation. In equatorial Asia, GFED4s outperforms other models in representing day-to-day changes, particularly during intense burning. In Southeast Asia, we recommend using the OC emission magnitude from FINN1.5 combined with daily variability from QFED2.5. In the Southern Hemisphere, the latest VFEI0 has performed relatively well. This study has implications for reducing the uncertainties in emissions and improving BB emission inventories in further studies.  Â© 2024 Copernicus Publications. All rights reserved.",
"Occurrence, abundance, and formation of atmospheric tarballs from a wide range of wildfires in the western US","Biomass burning emits large numbers of organic aerosol particles, a subset of which are called tarballs (TBs). TBs possess a spherical morphology and unique physical, chemical, and optical properties. They are recognized as brown-carbon aerosol particles, influencing the climate through the absorption of solar radiation. Aerosol particles were collected from wildfire and agricultural-fire smoke sampled by NASA's DC-8 aircraft during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) campaign in the western US from July to September 2019. This study developed an image analysis method using deep learning to distinguish TBs from other round particles that deformed on the substrate, based on the particles' morphological characteristics in transmission electron microscopy images. This study detected 4567 TBs, with most occurring < 10 h downwind of the emissions, and measured their compositions, abundance, sizes, and mixing states. The number fraction, mass fraction, and concentration of TBs in wildfire smoke corresponded to 10 Â± 1 %, 10 Â± 2 %, and 10.1 Â± 4.6 Î¼gm-3, respectively. As the smoke aged for up to 5 h after emission, the TB number fractions roughly increased from 5 % to 15 %, indicating that TBs are processed primary particles. We also observed TBs associated with pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) activity and various TB mixing states. This study reveals the abundance, as well as the physical and chemical properties, of a wide range of TBs from various biomass-burning events and enhances our knowledge of TB emissions, contributing to the evaluation of the climate impact of TBs.

Characterization of atmospheric nitroaromatic compounds in Southwest China by direct injection liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of aerosol extracts,"Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) in ambient particles are of great concern due to their adverse effects on human health and climate. However, investigations on the characteristics and potential sources of NACs in Southwest China are still scarce. In this study, a field sampling campaign was carried out in the winter of 2022 at a suburban site in Mianyang, Southwest China. A direct injection liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed to rapidly determine 10 NACs in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) extracts. The method was sensitive for the quantification of the NACs, with a limit of quantification (LOQ) in the range of 0.092â€“0.52 ng mLâˆ’1. Then, the developed method was applied to determine the concentrations of nitrophenols (NPs), nitrocatechols (NCs), nitrosalicylic acids (NSAs), and nitronaphthol in PM2.5 in Mianyang. The average concentration of total NACs was 78.2 Â± 31.2 ng mâˆ’3, with daily concentrations ranging from 20.7 to 127.9 ng mâˆ’3. Among the measured NACs, 4-nitrocatechol was the most abundant, accounting for 57.8% of the NACs in winter. The five NPs compounds together contributed to 14% of the NACs, which was lower than in other Chinese cities due to the warm climate in winter in Southwest China. NSAs and nitronaphthol each accounted for less than 5% of the NACs. Three major sources of NACs were identified based on the principal component analysis, including vehicle emissions, biomass burning, and secondary formation. The significant correlation between individual NACs and NO2 supported their secondary formation sources. The good correlation between NPs and cloud amount further suggested that gas-phase oxidation was the possible NPs formation mechanism. Our findings revealed the important role of nitrocatechols in NACs in Southwest China, implying that more measures should be taken to control biomass burning and aromatic volatile organic compounds emissions to reduce the level of NACs.

Evaluation of WRF-Chem PM2.5 simulations in Thailand with different anthropogenic and biomass-burning emissions,"Thailand experiences severe air quality issues, predominantly due to PM2.5 pollution that surpasses WHO guidelines. The main sources are attributed to energy production, industrial activities, vehicular emissions, agricultural burning, and transboundary transport of pollutants. Understanding the transport and transformation of these pollutants is necessary for addressing air quality issues. The Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) provides information about meteorology, chemical reactions, and transport of trace gases and aerosols. The accuracy of WRF-Chem simulations greatly depends on the choice of anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions inventories. This study provides a detailed evaluation of these inventories to model PM2.5 concentrations in Thailand during both haze and off-haze seasons in 2019. We evaluated WRF-Chem using four anthropogenic emission inventoriesâ€”CAMS-GLOB-ANT, ECLIPSE, HTAP, and REASâ€”and four biomass burning emissions inventoriesâ€”FINN1.5, FINN2.5 MOD, FINN2.5 MODVAR, and QFEDâ€”using data from ground-based air quality stations, MODIS AOD, and MOPITT CO satellite data. Our findings suggest CAMS-GLOB-ANT performs optimally for North Thailand, while HTAP and REAS are more effective in Eastern Thailand. For biomass burning, FINN1.5 shows superior performance. The study also highlights the challenge in capturing PM2.5 diurnal variability, particularly due to inaccuracies in simulating the planetary boundary layer height during nighttime in complex terrains. Moreover, our analysis exhibits moderate model performances during the off-haze season while using global and regional anthropogenic emissions in Thailand, emphasizing the need for improving anthropogenic inventories for reliable air quality prediction. For biomass burning emissions, updating emission factors to reflect Thailand's specific vegetation types is recommended to improve WRF-Chem's representation of PM2.5 levels. Â© 2024 The Authors",
Comparisons of aerosol types and optical characters over Shouxian Area China observed from ground- and space-based systems,"This study evaluates the performance of moderate-resolution Imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in aerosol optical depth(AOD) and Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent(AE) retrievals under high aerosol loading conditions across various aerosol types, utilizing ground-based and space-borne aerosol measurements in Shouxian, China. The intercomparison reveals cloud-aerosol LiDAR with orthogonal polarizationâ€™s (CALIOP) efficacy in detecting significant aerosol layers and the refinement of sunphotometer-based aerosol type classification through CALIPSO, achieving approximately 80% accuracy. Analysis of 2016-2017 data indicates substantial aerosol presence in Shouxian, with monthly mean AODs ranging from 0.35 to 0.72 at 550 nm, significantly above the global average. The predominant aerosol types were mixed-type (54.8%), desert dust (21.2%), urban/industrial(15.5%), biomass-burning aerosol (6.4%), and continental aerosol (12.1%), with frequent observations of elevated long-range transported aerosol layers. MODIS AOD retrievals generally align with sunphotometer measurements but exhibit higher biases, especially with increasing AOD magnitudes. However, there is a notable difference between MODIS and sunphotometer aerosol AE measurements, with MODIS accurately assessing BBA but showing varied performance across other aerosol types. The combination of AOD and AE of the DD aerosol type is the most accurate. Further analysis showed that MODIS AOD biases and AE biases are negatively correlated, these negative bias correlations show strong aerosol type sensitivities. Monthly analysis of MODIS and sunphotometer comparisons highlights varying performance, particularly during normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) transitions, suggesting that local vegetation cycles and associated surface spectral reflectance changes significantly impact MODIS aerosol retrieval accuracy under high aerosol loading conditions.

Impact of anthropogenic emission control in reducing future PM2.5 concentrations and the related oxidative potential across different regions of China,"Affected by both future anthropogenic emissions and climate change, future prediction of PM2.5 and its Oxidative Potential (OP) distribution is a significant challenge, especially in developing countries like China. To overcome this challenge, we estimated historical and future PM2.5 concentrations and associated OP using the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) system with meteorological input from WRF weather forecast model. Considering different future socio-economic pathways and emission scenario assumptions, we quantified how the contribution from various anthropogenic emission sectors will change under these scenarios. Results show that compared to the CESM_SSP2â€“4.5_CLE scenario (based on moderate radiative forcing and Current Legislation Emission), the CESM_SSP1â€“2.6_MFR scenario (based on sustainability development and Maximum Feasible Reductions) is projected to yield greater environmental and health benefits in the future. Under the CESM_SSP1â€“2.6_MFR scenario, annual average PM2.5 concentrations (OP) are expected to decrease to 30 Î¼gmâˆ’3 (0.8 nmolminâˆ’1mâˆ’3) in almost all regions by 2030, which will be 65 % (67 %) lower than that in 2010. From a long-term perspective, it is anticipated that OP in the Fen-Wei Plain region will experience the maximum reduction (82.6 %) from 2010 to 2049. Largely benefiting from the effective control of PM2.5 in the region, it has decreased by 82.1 %. Crucially, once emission reduction measures reach a certain level (in 2040), further reductions become less significant. This study also emphasized the significant role of secondary aerosol formation and biomass-burning sources in influencing OP during both historical and future periods. In different scenarios, the reduction range of OP from 2010 to 2049 is estimated to be between 71 % and 85 % by controlling precursor emissions involved in secondary aerosol formation and emissions from biomass burning. Results indicate that strengthening the control of anthropogenic emissions in various regions are key to achieving air quality targets and safeguarding human health in the future.

Geostationary aerosol retrievals of extreme biomass burning plumes during the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires,"Extreme biomass burning (BB) events, such as those seen during the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season, are becoming more frequent and intense with climate change. Ground-based observations of these events can provide useful information on the macro-and micro-physical properties of the plumes, but these observations are sparse, especially in regions which are at risk of intense bushfire events. Satellite observations of extreme BB events provide a unique perspective, with the newest generation of geostationary imagers, such as the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), observing entire continents at moderate spatial and high temporal resolution. However, current passive satellite retrieval methods struggle to capture the high values of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) seen during these BB events. Accurate retrievals are necessary for global and regional studies of shortwave radiation, air quality modelling and numerical weather prediction. To address these issues, the Optimal Retrieval of Aerosol and Cloud (ORAC) algorithm has used AHI data to measure extreme BB plumes from the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season. The sensitivity of the retrieval to the assumed optical properties of BB plumes is explored by comparing retrieved AOT with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) level-1.5 data over the AERONET site at Tumbarumba, New South Wales, between 1 December 2019 at 00:00UTC and 3 January 2020 at 00:00UTC. The study shows that for AOT values >2, the sensitivity to the assumed optical properties is substantial. The ORAC retrievals and AERONET data are compared against the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Aerosol Retrieval Product (ARP), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue over land, MODIS MAIAC, Sentinel-3 SYN and VIIRS Deep Blue products. The comparison shows the ORAC retrieval significantly improves coverage of optically thick plumes relative to the JAXA ARP, with approximately twice as many pixels retrieved and peak retrieved AOT values 1.4 times higher than the JAXA ARP. The ORAC retrievals have accuracy scores of 0.742-0.744 compared to the values of 0.718-0.833 for the polar-orbiting satellite products, despite successfully retrieving approximately 28 times as many pixels over the study period as the most successful polar-orbiting satellite product. The AHI and MODIS satellite products are compared for three case studies covering a range of BB plumes over Australia. The results show good agreement between all products for plumes with AOT values â‰¤2. For extreme BB plumes, the ORAC retrieval finds values of AOT >15, significantly higher than those seen in events classified as extreme by previous studies, although with high uncertainty. A combination of hard limits in the retrieval algorithms and misclassification of BB plumes as cloud prevents the JAXA and MODIS products from returning AOT values significantly greater than 5.

Mitigating underestimation of fire emissions from the Advanced Himawari Imager: A machine learning and multi-satellite ensemble approach,"The accurate estimation of biomass burning emissions has played a crucial role in air quality and climate forecast modeling. Satellite-based fire radiative power (FRP) has proven effective for calculating biomass burning emissions. However, FRP-based emission estimations in East Asia often rely on polar-orbiting satellites owing to the unstable performance of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Advanced Himawari Imager (JAXA AHI) from poor detection capability and unproper FRP retrieval method. To address this, we improve the FRP by machine learning based on mid-infrared (MIR) radiance method, leveraging the superior fire detection model developed in our previous study. In addition, we propose a multi-satellite distance-based weighted ensemble FRP estimation method. Compared to traditional MIR radiance methods, the machine learning-based FRP estimation model exhibited promising performance (correlation coefficient: 1, mean bias error: 0.2, mean absolute percentage error: 1.9%). The integration of machine learning-based FRP estimation and fire detection model dramatically mitigated the underestimation issues from the JAXA AHI. The machine learning-based FRP was combined with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer FRP to create a multi-satellite ensemble FRP. Comparative assessments using the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument and conventional bottom-up method demonstrated that the proposed method produced reliable output. Furthermore, impact analysis revealed that missing peaks or underestimated burn scars could lead to fatally low emissions; however, the proposed method was relatively robust against missing data owing to its multi-satellite ensemble. By identifying potential FRP problems and their impact on emission estimations, this study provides valuable insights for FRP-based emission estimation studies. Â© 2024 The Author(s)",
Attributing Atmospheric Phosphorus in the Himalayas: Biomass Burning vs Mineral Dust,"Atmospheric phosphorus is a vital nutrient for ecosystems whose sources and fate are still debated in the fragile Himalayan region, hindering our comprehension of its local ecological impact. This study provides novel insights into atmospheric phosphorus based on the study of total suspended particulate matter at the Qomolangma station. Contrary to the prevailing assumptions, we show that biomass burning (BB), not mineral dust, dominates total dissolved phosphorus (TDP, bioavailable) deposition in this arid region, especially during spring. While total phosphorus is mainly derived from dust (77% annually), TDP is largely affected by the transport of regional biomass-burning plumes from South Asia. During BB pollution episodes, TDP causing springtime TDP fluxes alone accounts for 43% of the annual budget. This suggests that BB outweighs dust in supplying bioavailable phosphorus, a critical nutrient, required to sustain Himalayasâ€™ ecological functions. Overall, this first-hand field evidence refines the regional and global phosphorus budget by demonstrating that BB emission, while still unrecognized, is a significant source of P, even in the remote mountains of the Himalayas. It also reveals the heterogeneity of atmospheric phosphorus deposition in that region, which will help predict changes in the impacted ecosystems as the deposition patterns vary.

Diurnal Carbon Monoxide Retrieval from FY-4B/GIIRS Using a Novel Machine Learning Method,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the primary reactive trace gases in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere and plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry. The Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard the FY-4 series satellites is currently the only geostationary hyperspectral thermal infrared sensor capable of monitoring the unprecedented hourly CO concentrations in East Asia during both daytime and nighttime. In this study, we presented a radiative transfer model-driven machine learning approach to quickly convert CO spectral features extracted from FY-4B/GIIRS into CO total columns. We built machine learning models for land and ocean regions separately from July 2022 to June 2023, and these models reproduced more than 97.77% (land) and 98.49% (ocean) of the CO column variance in the training set. We estimated the absolute uncertainty of the retrieved CO column based on error propagation theory and found that it is dominated by GIIRS measurement noise. We compared the machine learning retrieval results with optimal estimation and ground-based Fourier transform infrared measurements, and the results reveal the consistent spatial distribution and temporal variation across these different datasets. Our results confirm that the machine learning method has the potential to provide reliable CO products without the computationally intensive iterative process required by traditional retrieval methods. The diel cycle and monthly variation of CO over land and ocean demonstrate the value of GIIRS in monitoring the long-range transport of anthropogenic pollutants and biomass burning emissions.

"Utilizing LSTM models to predict PM2.5 levels during critical episodes in Delhi, the world's most polluted capital city","The aim of this study was to utilize a Recurrent Neural Network with long short-term memory (LSTM) units to forecast PM2.5 levels in Delhi. Four monitoring stations in Delhi were used to gather the PM2.5 data required for training and evaluating the models. The models used in the study included four different combinations of variables: (i) PM2.5 data only, (ii) PM2.5 data combined with meteorology, (iii) PM2.5 data combined with gaseous pollutants, and (iv) PM2.5 data combined with gaseous pollutants and meteorology. The results revealed that the models incorporating PM2.5 data with gaseous pollutants and PM2.5 data with gaseous pollutants and meteorology provided more accurate forecasts of daily and hourly PM2.5 levels compared to the other models. To further enhance the prediction of PM2.5 during critical episodes, outlier identification methods were employed to examine the models. The episodes analyzed in the study included dust storms, stubble burning, unfavorable meteorological conditions, and Diwali. The analysis showed that events at one monitoring station occurred before similar events in other regions due to wind direction and non-local PM2.5 sources. During these episodes, the models incorporating gaseous pollutants performed better due to the dominance of secondary components in PM2.5 for which the gaseous pollutants act as precursor components. The study provides confidence in the accuracy and effectiveness of the models in aiding regulators to implement prompt interventions in cities facing severe pollution issues. Â© 2023",
Prediction of the Concentration and Source Contributions of PM2.5 and Gas-Phase Pollutants in an Urban Area with the SmartAQ Forecasting System,"The SmartAQ (Smart Air Quality) forecasting system produces high-resolution (1 Ã— 1 km2) air quality predictions in an urban area for the next three days using advanced chemical transport modeling. In this study, we evaluated the SmartAQ performance for the urban area of Patras, Greece, for four months (July 2021, September 2021, December 2021, and March 2022), covering all seasons. In this work, we assess the systemâ€™s ability to forecast PM2.5 levels and the major gas-phase pollutants during periods with different meteorological conditions and local emissions, but also in areas of the city with different characteristics (urban, suburban, and background sites). We take advantage of this SmartAQ application to also quantify the main sources of the pollutants at each site. During the summertime, PM2.5 model performance was excellent (Fbias < 15%, Ferror < 30%) for all sites both in the city center and suburbs. For the city center, the model reproduced well (MB = âˆ’0.9 Î¼g mâˆ’3, ME = 2.5 Î¼g mâˆ’3) the overall measured PM2.5 behavior and the high nighttime peaks due to cooking activity, as well as the transported PM pollution in the suburbs. During the fall, the SmartAQ PM2.5 performance was good (Fbias < 42%, Ferror < 45%) for the city center and the suburban core, while it was average (Fbias < 50%, Ferror < 54%, MB, ME < 3.3 Î¼g mâˆ’3) for the suburbs because the model overpredicted the long-range transport of pollution. For wintertime, the system reproduced well (MB = âˆ’2 Î¼g mâˆ’3, ME = 6.5 Î¼g mâˆ’3) the PM2.5 concentration in the high-biomass-burning emission area with an excellent model performance (Fbias = âˆ’4%, Ferror = 33%) and reproduced well (MB < 1.1 Î¼g mâˆ’3, ME < 3 Î¼g mâˆ’3) the background PM2.5 levels. SmartAQ reproduced well the PM2.5 concentrations in the urban and suburban core during the spring (Fbias < 40%, Ferror < 50%, MB < 8.5 Î¼g mâˆ’3, ME < 10 Î¼g mâˆ’3), while it tended to slightly overestimate the regional pollution. The main local source of fine PM during summer and autumn was cooking, but most of the PM was transported to the city. Residential biomass burning was the dominant particle source of pollution during winter and early spring. For gas-phase pollutants, the system reproduced well the daily nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentrations during the summertime. Predicted NOx concentrations during the winter were consistent with measurements at night but underestimated the observations during the rest of the day. SmartAQ achieved the US EPA modeling goals for hourly O3 concentrations indicating good model performance. Â© 2023 by the authors.",

Dispersal of microbes from grassland fire smoke to soils,"Wildland fire is increasingly recognized as a driver of bioaerosol emissions, but the effects that smoke-emitted microbes have on the diversity and community assembly patterns of the habitats where they are deposited remain unknown. In this study, we examined whether microbes aerosolized by biomass burning smoke detectably impact the composition and function of soil sinks using lab-based mesocosm experiments. Soils either containing the native microbial community or presterilized by Î³-irradiation were inundated with various doses of smoke from native tallgrass prairie grasses. Smoke-inundated, Î³-irradiated soils exhibited significantly higher respiration rates than both smoke-inundated, native soils and Î³-irradiated soils exposed to ambient air only. Microbial communities in Î³-irradiated soils were significantly different between smoke-treated and control soils, which supports the hypothesis that wildland fire smoke can act as a dispersal agent. Community compositions differed based on smoke dose, incubation time, and soil type. Concentrations of phosphate and microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen together with pH were significant predictors of community composition. Source tracking analysis attributed smoke as contributing nearly 30% of the taxa found in smoke-inundated, Î³-irradiated soils, suggesting smoke may play a role in the recovery of microbial communities in similar damaged soils. Our findings demonstrate that short-distance microbial dispersal by biomass burning smoke can influence the assembly processes of microbial communities in soils and has implications for a broad range of subjects including agriculture, restoration, plant disease, and biodiversity.

Innovative carbon emission estimation strategy for biomass materials using near-infrared (NIR) spectrum,"The world's biomass resources amount to around 170.00 billion tons currently. In contrast, global biomass energy consumption only accounts for about 14 % of the world's total energy consumption. Direct combustion of biomass raw materials and production of bio-natural gas are the two main methods for biomass utilization. In this study, 99 samples of 4 types of biomass materials from eight provinces of China were collected to determine the heat production efficiency of these two methods. Chemometric algorithms and deep learning (DL) were applied to connect the calorific value and methane yield (MY) of materials with their near-infrared (NIR) wavelength region. As a result, a model was proposed for predicting biomass heat release, which could be applied to the rapid evaluation of the calorific value utilization and MY of biomass resources. Meanwhile, the results showed that the GWP caused by direct combustion of straw and manure was estimated to be 1.8â€“3.1 times that of biogas in 20â€“500 years. The conversion of raw materials into biogas could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to direct combustion. The NIR model by DL achieved excellent evaluation results to accurately predict calorific value and MY for the biomass feedstocks with determination coefficient and residual prediction deviation being 0.97 and 4.19, respectively.

Evaluation of WRF-chem simulations of NO2 and CO from biomass burning over East Africa and its surrounding regions,"In East Africa, biomass burning in the savanna region emits nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and aerosols among other species. These emissions are dangerous air pollutants which pose a health risk to the population. They also affect the radiation budget. Currently, limited academic research has been done to study their spatial and temporal distribution over this region by means of numerical modeling. This study therefore used the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-chem) to simulate, for the first time, the distribution of NO2 during the year 2012 and CO during the period June 2015 to May 2016 over this region. These periods had the highest atmospheric abundances of these species. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated against satellite observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT). Three evaluation metrics were used, these were, the normalized mean bias (NMB), the root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient (R). Further, an attempt was made to reduce the bias shown by WRF-chem by applying a deep convolutional autoencoder (WRF-DCA) algorithm and linear scaling (WRF-LS). The results showed that WRF-chem simulated the seasonality of the gases but made below adequate estimates of the gas abundances. It overestimated NO2 and underestimated CO throughout all the seasons. Overall, for NO2, WRF-chem had an average NMB of 3.51, RMSE of 2 Ã— 1015 molecules/cm2 and R of 0.44 while for CO, it had an average NMB of âˆ’Â 0.063, RMSE of 0.65 Ã— 1018 molecules/cm2 and R of 0.13. Furthermore, even though both WRF-DCA and WRF-LS successfully reduced the bias in WRF-chemâ€™s NO2 estimates, WRF-DCA had a superior performance compared to WRF-LS. It reduced the NMB by an average of 3.2 (90.2%). Finally, this study has shown that deep learning has a strong ability to improve the estimates of numerical models, and this can be a cue to incorporate this approach along other stages of the numerical modeling process.

"Classification of Aerosols Types over Iraq, using MODIS Date","The optical properties of aerosols are derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations for the period 2003-2021 at seventeen regions in Iraq, which were used to determine the different types of aerosols using threshold values based on Aerosols Optical Depth (AOD) and Angstrom Exponent (AE), seasonal aerosol classification was performed. This approach was verified and used in the detection process. Six aerosols categories: maritime, dust, mixture, urban, dust desert, and biomass burning were examined in this study. The result indicates that dust is most frequently detected in the summer and spring seasons, while the maritime type is most common in the winter and autumn, with wide variability in mixture type. The relative contribution during the winter months revealed a clear predominance of Maritime-type aerosols in the northern part of Iraq. Maximum contributions recorded in Erbil (93%), and Sulaymaniyah (90%). The maximum relative contributions of dust are found in the range of 71%-77% over Qaim and Haditha, while the southern regions of Iraq have a percentage ranging from 54%-65% in the summer season. The results of the monthly classification of aerosol type indicate that dust type are overhead maritime aerosols between March and September in the west, northwest, and south regions of Iraq. The highest contribution of desert dust was recorded in Basra, 60% during July and August. The maximum urban type was recorded at 50% in Baghdad in June. Biomass-burning type contribution was very little. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",
Hourly biomass burning emissions product from blended geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites for air quality forecasting applications,"Biomass burning influences atmospheric composition and regional air quality. The hourly biomass-burning emissions are usually required by air quality models, yet most available emission inventories provide daily or monthly estimates in 0.1Â° or coarser grids, limiting the prediction accuracy. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites â€“ R Series (GOES-R) observes fires across the conterminous United States (CONUS) every 5 min at a spatial resolution of 2 km, which allows for characterizing fires and emissions on diurnal scale. In this study, we developed a new operational algorithm to generate regional hourly 3 km fire emission across the CONUS by fusing temporally resolved ABI fire radiative power (FRP) and fine spatial-resolution (375 m) FRP from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) satellites. To do this, ABI FRP was first calibrated against and fused with VIIRS FRP in 3 km grids. Then, FRP diurnal cycles at an interval of 5 min were reconstructed using the fused ABI-VIIRS FRP and the land cover-ecoregion-specific FRP diurnal climatologies. The reconstructed FRP diurnal cycles were applied to estimate hourly emissions of eight species (e.g., carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter with diameters <2.5 Î¼m (PM2.5)). The accuracy was verified by comparing with CO observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, and with PM2.5 emissions from eight other inventories. The results of the ABI-VIIRS estimates during one year from April 2020 to March 2021 indicate that fires burned 221 Tg dry matter and emit 2.25 Tg PM2.5 emissions across the CONUS. The seasonal and diurnal patterns of emissions vary with land cover types. The largest and smallest seasonal variations are shown in forest and agriculture fire emissions, respectively. The diurnal emission patterns of different land cover types share similar shapes but differ largely in magnitude. Moreover, the diurnal pattern of forest fire emissions suggests that emissions are dominated during daytime in the eastern U.S. but strong during both daytime and nighttime in the western U.S. The evaluation shows that the fused ABI-VIIRS based CO agrees well with the TROPOMI CO, with a difference of 11%. However, the agreement between fused ABI-VIIRS emissions and other inventories varies for different fire events. Â© 2022",
Quantifying international and interstate contributions to primary ambient PM2.5 and PM10 in a complex metropolitan atmosphere,"We quantify the contributions of long-range and regionally transported aerosols to ambient primary PM2.5 and PM10 in a representative United States industrialized/urban atmosphere via detailed elemental analysis and chemical mass balance (CMB) modeling after identifying their presence using a variety of publicly available satellite data/information, software products, and synoptic-scale aerosol models. A year-long study in Houston, Texas identified North African dust as the principal long-range global source of primary particulate matter (PM). CMB estimated transatlantic dust from the Sahara-Sahel region to be dominant in the summer months contributing an average of 3.5 Î¼g mâˆ’3 to PM2.5 and 7.9 Î¼g mâˆ’3 to PM10 during Mayâ€“August, i.e., the active Saharan dust season. Biomass burning was the chief source of regionally transported PM impacting air quality on different occasions throughout the year depending on the fire location. Four major biomass combustion events affecting air quality in Texas were calculated to contribute an average of 1.3 Î¼g mâˆ’3 to PM2.5 and 1.4 Î¼g mâˆ’3 to PM10 in corresponding samples whose origins were tracked to Canada, southeastern states of USA, and Central America using fire maps, HYSPLIT back trajectories, and the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System global aerosol model. Elemental concentrations and signature ratios revealed significant mixing of potassium, rare earth metals, and vanadium from proximal and distal crustal (natural) sources with anthropogenically emitted PM. This demonstrates the need to isolate the non-mineral components of these metals to employ them as tracers for primary PM emitted by biomass burning, petroleum refineries, and oil combustion. Transboundary contributions to primary PM2.5 were 1.5 Î¼g mâˆ’3 and 3.1 Î¼g mâˆ’3 to PM10 adding 16% to annual average mass concentration of both size fractions demonstrating that local sources were primarily responsible for ambient air quality with non-trivial contributions from international and interstate sources. Rigorously identifying and quantifying aerosol sources assists in improving air quality management policies designed to protect public health and comply with ever-decreasing federal PM standards that allow state agencies to exclude contributions that are not reasonably controllable or preventable from regulatory decisions and actions.

Detection and attribution of the decreasing precipitation and extreme drought 2020 in southeastern China,"Southeastern China experienced a drying trend and the precipitation deficit in 2020 exerts great stress to the water supply and the environment. This paper analyzed the large-scale climate patterns relating to the precipitation deficit in 2020 and attribute the decreasing precipitation and drought over southeastern China based on observations and large GCM ensembles, including HadGEM3-GA6 and CESM LENS single forcing simulations. Results show that the precipitation deficit in 2020 mostly results from the anomalously persistent WPSH over South China and a lack of cold air intrusion to South China, and it is also associated with the La NiÃ±a-like Pacific. Detection analyses show that anthropogenic influences have resulted in decreasing precipitation. The aerosol emissions, including industrial aerosols (AER) and biomass burning aerosols (BMB), have substantially decreased precipitation over southeastern China, while the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) have slightly increased precipitation. Because the AER and BMB effects of decreasing precipitation are larger than the GHG effects of increasing precipitation, precipitation shows a decreasing trend in recent decades. However, as the aerosols emission from industry and biomass burning decreases, the AER and BMB effects of decreasing precipitation will be reduced. Future precipitation over southeastern China is projected to increase due to the GHG effects of increasing precipitation. There were AER and BMB impacts on occurrences of drought over southeastern China, but the anthropogenic GHG impacts on the intensity, duration, and severity of drought are not detectable.

Development and evaluation of the Aerosol Forecast Member in the National Center for Environment Prediction (NCEP)'s Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS-Aerosols v1),"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Weather Service (NWS) is on its way to deploying various operational prediction applications using the Unified Forecast System (https://ufscommunity.org/, last access: 18 June 2022), a community-based coupled, comprehensive Earth modeling system. An aerosol model component developed in collaboration between the Global Systems Laboratory, Chemical Science Laboratory, Air Resources Laboratory, and Environmental Modeling Center (GSL, CSL, ARL, EMC) was coupled online with the FV3 Global Forecast System (FV3GFS) using the National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC)-based NOAA Environmental Modeling System (NEMS) software framework. This aerosol prediction system replaced the NEMS GFS Aerosol Component version 2 (NGACv2) system in the National Center for Environment Prediction (NCEP) production suite in September 2020 as one of the ensemble members of the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), dubbed GEFS-Aerosols v1. The aerosol component of atmospheric composition in the GEFS is based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). GEFS-Aerosols includes bulk modules from the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport model (GOCART). Additionally, the biomass burning plume rise module from High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR)-Smoke based on WRF-Chem was implemented. The GOCART dust scheme was replaced by the FENGSHA dust scheme (developed by ARL). The Blended Global Biomass Burning Emissions Product (GBBEPx version 3) provides biomass burning emission and fire radiative power (FRP) data. The global anthropogenic emission inventories are derived from the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS). All sub-grid-scale transport and deposition are handled inside the atmospheric physics routines, which required consistent implementation of positive definite tracer transport and wet scavenging in the physics parameterizations used by the NCEP's operational FV3GFS. This paper describes the details of GEFS-Aerosols model development and evaluation of real-time and retrospective runs using different observations from in situ measurement and satellite and aircraft data. GEFS-Aerosols predictions demonstrate substantial improvements for both composition and variability of aerosol distributions over those from the former operational NGACv2 system with the fundamental updates (e.g., dust and fire emission) in the atmospheric and chemical transport model.

Smoke from 2020 United States wildfires responsible for substantial solar energy forecast errors,"The 2020 wildfire season (May through December) in the United States was exceptionally active, with the National Interagency Fire Center reporting over 10 million acres ( > 40 000 km2) burned. During the September 2020 wildfire events, large concentrations of smoke particulates were emitted into the atmosphere. As a result, smoke was responsible for âˆ¼10%-30% reduction in solar power production during peak hours as recorded by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) sites. In this study, we focus on a 9 d period in September when wildfire smoke had a profound impact on solar energy production. During the smoke episodes, hour-ahead forecasts utilized by CAISO did not include the effects of smoke and therefore overestimated the expected power production by âˆ¼10%-50%. Here we use multiple observational networks and a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model to show that the wildfire events of 2020 had a significantly detrimental influence on solar energy production due to high aerosol loading. We find that including the contribution of biomass burning particles greatly improves the day-ahead solar energy bias forecast of both global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance by nearly âˆ¼50%. Our results suggest that a more comprehensive treatment of aerosols, including biomass burning aerosols, in NWP models may be an important consideration for energy grid balancing, in addition to solar resource assessment, as solar power reliance increases.

Automated detection of atmospheric NO2 plumes from satellite data: A tool to help infer anthropogenic combustion emissions,"We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify plumes of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a tracer of combustion, from NO2 column data collected by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). This approach allows us to exploit efficiently the growing volume of satellite data available to characterize Earth's climate. For the purposes of demonstration, we focus on data collected between July 2018 and June 2020. We train the deep learning model using six thousand 28ÄÃ—Ä28 pixel images of TROPOMI data (corresponding to Äâ€° Ä266ÄkmÄÃ—Ä133Äkm) and find that the model can identify plumes with a success rate of more than 90Ä%. Over our study period, we find over 310Ä000 individual NO2 plumes, of which Äâ€° Ä19Ä% are found over mainland China. We have attempted to remove the influence of open biomass burning using correlative high-resolution thermal infrared data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We relate the remaining NO2 plumes to large urban centres, oil and gas production, and major power plants. We find no correlation between NO2 plumes and the location of natural gas flaring. We also find persistent NO2 plumes from regions where inventories do not currently include emissions. Using an established anthropogenic CO2 emission inventory, we find that our NO2 plume distribution captures 92Ä% of total CO2 emissions, with the remaining 8Ä% mostly due to a large number of small sources (<Ä0.2ÄgÄCÄm-2Äd-1) to which our NO2 plume model is less sensitive. We argue that the underlying CNN approach could form the basis of a Bayesian framework to estimate anthropogenic combustion emissions.  Â© Copyright: ",
A Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms in Predicting Pulmonary diseases,"Smart cities are becoming increasingly significant as a result of global urbanization and the drive for more sustainable and livable communities. A smart city's network of interconnected heterogeneous devices generates a plethora of data. Furthermore, it is generally known that air pollution exists all around us as a result of numerous automobiles on the road, stubble burning or fire, and industrial air pollution; this is detrimental to our health, particularly our lungs. Therefore it is important to predict lung diseases very accurately and precisely. In this paper, three algorithms are used 'NaÃ¯ve Bayes', '(Support Vector Machine) SVM', and '(K-Nearest neighbor) K-NN' Algorithms to predict lung diseases based on the symptoms. The accuracy percentage of each algorithm is calculated, which states that K-NN is better than both the algorithms when the number of clusters taken is equal to or greater than six. Â© 2022 IEEE.",
Inline coupling of simple and complex chemistry modules within the global weather forecast model FIM (FIM-Chem v1),"The global Flow-following finite-volume Icosahedral Model (FIM), which was developed in the Global Systems Laboratory (GSL) of NOAA, has been coupled inline with aerosol and gas-phase chemistry schemes of different complexity using the chemistry and aerosol packages from WRF-Chem v3.7, named FIM-Chem v1. The three chemistry schemes include (1) the simple aerosol modules from the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport model that includes only simplified sulfur chemistry, black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), and sectional dust and sea salt modules (GOCART); (2) the photochemical gas phase of the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM) coupled to GOCART to determine the impact of more realistic gas-phase chemistry on the GOCART aerosol simulations (RACM-GOCART); and (3) a further sophistication within the aerosol modules by replacing GOCART with a modal aerosol scheme that includes secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) based on the volatility basis set (VBS) approach (RACM-SOA-VBS). FIM-Chem is able to simulate aerosol, gas-phase chemical species, and SOA at various spatial resolutions with different levels of complexity and quantify the impact of aerosol on numerical weather prediction (NWP). We compare the results of RACM-GOCART and GOCART schemes which use the default climatological model fields for OH, H2O2, and NO3. We find significant reductions of sulfate that are on the order of 40% to 80% over the eastern US and are up to 40% near the Beijing region over China when using the RACM-GOCART scheme. We also evaluate the model performance by comparing it with the Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom-1) aircraft measurements in the summer of 2016. FIM-Chem shows good performance in capturing the aerosol and gas-phase tracers. The model-predicted vertical profiles of biomass burning plumes and dust plumes off western Africa are also reproduced reasonably well. Copyright:  Â© 2022 Li Zhang et al.",
PM 2.5 modelling during paddy stubble burning months using artificial intelligence techniques,"Purpose: In this study, the artificial intelligence techniques namely Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine are employed for PM 2.5 modelling. The study is carried out in Rohtak city of India during paddy stubble burning months i.e., October and November. The different models are compared to check their respective efficacies and also sensitivity analysis is performed to know about the most vital parameter in PM 2.5 modelling. Design/methodology/approach: The air pollution data of October and November months from the year 2016 to 2020 was collected for the study. The months of October and November are chosen as paddy stubble burning and major festivities using fireworks occur during these months. The untoward data entries viz. zero values, blank data, etc. were eliminated from the gathered data set and thereafter 231 observations of each parameter were left for the conduct of the presented study. The different models i.e., ANN, RF, SVM, etc. had PM 2.5 as an output variable while relative humidity, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, temperature, solar radiation, wind direction and wind speed acted as input variables. The prototypes created from the training data set are verified on the testing data set. A sensitivity analysis is also done to quantify impact of various parameters on output variable i.e., PM 2.5. Findings: The performance of the SVM_RBF based model turned out to be the best with the performance parameters being the coefficient of determination, root mean square error, and mean absolute error. In the sensitivity test, sulphur dioxide (SO2) was adjudged as the most vital variable. Research limitations/implications: The quantification capacity of the generated models may go beyond the used data set of observations. Practical implications: The artificial intelligence techniques provide precise estimation and forecasting of PM 2.5 in the air during paddy stubble burning months of October and November. Originality/value: Unlike the past research work that focus on modelling of various air pollution parameters, this study in specific focuses on the modelling of most vital air pollutant i.e., PM 2.5 that too specifically during the paddy stubble burning months of October and November when the air pollution is at its peak in northern India.

Impact of biomass burnings in Southeast Asia on air quality and pollutant transport during the end of the 2019 dry season,"At the end of the dry season, March and April in Southeast Asia (SEA), agricultural refuse burnings occur over the region, mainly in the countries of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, in preparation for the wet rice plantation. In this study, the impact of biomass burnings at the height of the burning period in March 2019 in mainland SEA on air quality and pollutant transport is modelled using the Weather Research Forecast WRF-Chem air quality model with emission input from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Fire Emission Inventory from NCAR (FINN). FINN is derived from satellite remote sensing data and species emission factors. A simulation of the dispersion of pollutants from biomass burnings from 13 to 19 March 2019, when the burnings was most intense, was performed. Validation of the model prediction using observed meteorological and pollutant data such as AOD measurements on ground from AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) and data from MODIS and CALIPSO satellites is carried out at various sites in the region. The results show that impact on air quality was most pronounced in Thailand and Laos but the effect of biomass burnings in mainland SEA at the end of the dry season is widespread in terms of pollutant dispersion and population exposure over the whole region and beyond. It is also shown that the transport of pollutants from biomass burnings in SEA to southern China, Taiwan and beyond is facilitated by the Truong Son mountain range, when under westerly wind, acting as a launching pad to uplift the pollutant plumes to higher altitude which then can be dispersed widely and transported farther from the biomass burning sources in Thailand and Laos.

Combining CALIPSO and AERONET Data to Classify Aerosols Globally,"Angstrom exponent (AE) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained from the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) and volume depolarization ratio (VDR) obtained from the cloud-Aerosol Lidar with orthogonal polarization (CALIOP) from March 2018 to February 2019 were used in our study. Data used in this study are direct observation, avoiding the limitations and uncertainties from the inversion process, and providing accurate information about the aerosol properties. Both instruments were within colocation criteria of a 40-km radius and Â±2 h were defined as coincident cases. Six aerosol types were differentiated using the threshold method based on the AE, AOD, and VDR data. Discussion of the aerosol classification yielded the following results: 1) clean marine aerosols were the most abundant and widely distributed aerosols, followed by other types of aerosol (33.2%), polluted dust aerosols (26.8%), natural dust aerosols (2.3%), biomass burning aerosols (1.8%), and clean continental aerosols (1.1%); 2) clean marine aerosols were mainly distributed in North America and Europe, and polluted dust aerosols frequently appeared on the edges or downwind of deserts; and 3) the aerosols controlled by natural conditions (e.g., natural dust aerosols) were sensitive to seasonal variations, whereas those controlled by anthropogenic activities (e.g., polluted dust aerosols) were not. This study provides a new method for the collaborative observation of aerosol types with ground-based and satellite data. It is rare to provide annual global distribution of aerosol types and their seasonal variations; these results provide a reference for understanding the global aerosol distribution status.

Modeling Volatility-Based Aerosol Phase State Predictions in the Amazon Rainforest,"Organic aerosol (OA) is a complex matrix of various constituents - fresh (primary organic aerosols - POA) and aged via oxidation (secondary organic aerosols - SOA), generated from biogenic, anthropogenic, and biomass burning sources. The viscosity of OA can be critical in influencing new particle formation, reactive uptake processes that impact evaporation-growth kinetics, and the lifetime of particles in the atmosphere. This work utilizes a well-defined relationship between volatility and viscosity for pure compounds, which we incorporated within the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled to chemistry (WRF-Chem) to simulate the phase state and viscosity of bulk OA during the dry-to-wet transition season (September-October) in the Amazon rainforest during 2014. Our simulations indicate spatial and temporal heterogeneity in aerosol phase state often not captured by global-scale models. We show the strong role of water associated with organic aerosol (ws) as the dominant factor that can be used to quantitatively estimate OA viscosity. Analysis of WRF-Chem simulations across the entire atmospheric column indicates a strong inverse log-linear relationship between ws and OA viscosity with a correlation coefficient approaching 1, in the background and biomass burning-influenced conditions. At high altitudes where relative humidity (RH) and temperatures are low, our simulations indicate that OA exists in a semisolid-/solid-like phase state, consistent with previous studies. OA hygroscopicity is strongly correlated (ca. -0.8) with OA viscosity at RH ca. 30-50%, but this RH range is found mostly at low OA concentrations and the middle troposphere (ca. 6-10 km altitudes) in our simulated domain. OA hygroscopicity is uncorrelated with viscosity at higher-RH (near surface) and lower-RH (upper troposphere) regimes. At the urban site near surface, where day-night differences in RH are significant, RH is found to drive the phase state. At the background forested site near surface, where day-night RH differences are small, biomass burning-influenced OA is semisolid and a significant OA associated with background conditions is liquid-like. Simulations indicate a long tail of OA viscosity frequency distributions extending in the semisolid/solid regimes over background biogenic-influenced conditions due to the role of low-volatility OA components such as monoterpene oxidation products.

Chemical composition of PM2.5 in October 2017 Northern California wildfire plumes,"Wildfires have become more common and intense in the western US over recent decades due to a combination of historical land management practices and warming climate. Emissions from large-scale fires now frequently affect populated regions such as the San Francisco Bay Area during the fall wildfire season, with documented impacts of the resulting particulate matter on human health. Health impacts of exposure to wildfire emissions depend on the chemical composition of particulate matter, but the molecular composition of the real biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) that reaches large population centers remains insufficiently characterized. We took PM2:5 (particles having aerodynamic diameters less than or equal to 2.5 Î¼m) samples at the University of California, Berkeley campus (~60 km downwind of the fires) during the October 2017 Northern California wildfires period and analyzed molecular composition of OA using a two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with highresolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-GC HRToF- MS). Sugar-like compounds were the most abundant component of BBOA, followed by mono-carboxylic acids, aromatic compounds, other oxygenated compounds, and terpenoids. The vast majority of compounds detected in smoke have unknown health impacts. Regression models were trained to predict the saturation vapor pressure and averaged carbon oxidation state (OSc) of detected compounds. The compounds speciated have a wide volatility distribution and most of them are highly oxygenated. In addition, time series of primary BBOA tracers observed in Berkeley were found to be indicative of the types of plants in the ecosystems burned in Napa and Sonoma, and could be used to differentiate the regions from which the smoke must have originated. Commonly used secondary BBOA markers like 4-nitrocatechol were enhanced when plumes aged, but their very fast formation caused them to have similar temporal variation as primary BBOA tracers. Using hierarchical clustering analysis, we classified compounds into seven factors indicative of their sources andtransformation processes, identifying a unique daytime secondary BBOA factor. Chemicals associated with this factor include multifunctional acids and oxygenated aromatic compounds. These compounds have high OSc, and they are also semi-volatile.We observed no net particle-phase organic carbon formation, which indicates an approximate balance between the mass of evaporated organic carbonaceous compounds and the addition of secondary organic carbonaceous compounds.

Improving wrf-chem meteorological analyses and forecasts over aerosol-polluted regions by incorporating naaps aerosol analyses,"When unaccounted for in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, heavy aerosol events can cause significant unrealized biases in forecast meteorological parameters such as surface temperature. To improve near-surface forecasting accuracies during heavy aerosol loadings, we demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating aerosol fields from a global chemical transport model as initial and boundary conditions into a higher-resolution NWP model with aerosolâ€“ meteorological coupling. This concept is tested for a major biomass burning smoke event over the northern Great Plains region of the United States that occurred during summer of 2015. Aerosol analyses from the global Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) are used as initial and boundary conditions for Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations. Through incorporating more realistic aerosol direct effects into the WRF-Chem simulations, errors in WRF-Chem simulated surface downward shortwave radiative fluxes and near-surface temperature are reduced when compared with surface-based observations. This study confirms the ability to decrease biases induced by the aerosol direct effect for regional NWP forecasts during high-impact aerosol episodes through the incorporation of analyses and forecasts from a global aerosol transport model.

The moving of high emission for biomass burning in China: View from multi-year emission estimation and human-driven forces,"Biomass burning (BB) has significant impacts on air quality, climate and human health. In China, the BB emission has changed substantially over the past decades while the multi-year variation held high uncertainty and the driving forces have addressed little attention. Here, this research aimed to conduct a comprehensive and systematic analysis of BB variation in China and provided precise and targeted BB emission reduction suggestions. The moving of high emission for BB from 2003 to 2014 was clearly identified, by the view of reliable emission estimation and anthropogenic impacts. Multiple satellite products, field survey, time varying biomass loading data and measured emission factors were adopted to better estimating BB emission and reducing the uncertainty. Social-economic analysis was added to assess the anthropogenic impacts on high emission variation quantitatively. Results showed that the cumulative BB emissions of OC, EC, CH4, NOX, NMVOC, SO2, NH3, CO, CO2, PM2.5 and PM10 during 2003-2014 were 1.6 Ã— 104, 5.64 Ã— 103, 3.57 Ã— 104, 1.7 Ã— 104, 5.44 Ã— 104, 2.96 Ã— 103, 6.77 Ã— 103, 6.5 Ã— 105, 1.15 Ã— 107, 5.26 Ã— 104 and 6.04 Ã— 104 Gg, respectively. Crop straw burning (in-field and domestic) in northeast China plain (NEP), north China plain (NCP), northern arid and semiarid region and loess plateau were the key sources, averagely contributed 73% for all the pollutants emission. While domestic straw burning and firewood burning in Sichuan basin (SB), Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and southern China were main contributors, averagely accounting for 70% of all the pollutants emission. On regional level, high emissions were mainly found in SB, NCP and NEP. Temporally, high emissions were mainly found in crop sowing harvesting and heating seasons. From 2003 to 2014, the BB emission for different biomass species has changed significantly in different regions. High emission has gradually moved from SB to NCP and NEP. Firewood burning and domestic straw burning emission decreased by 47% and 14% in SB, respectively. In-field straw burning emission increased by 52% and 231% in NCP and NEP respectively and domestic straw burning emission increased by 62% in NEP. Emissions from heating season have decreased while emissions in corn harvest season were continuously increased. Analysis of Environmental kuznets curve, agricultural productivity level, human burning habits, rural energy structure and local control policies revealed the internal human driving strength of the variation for BB emission. The unbalanced development of social economy and the policy bias were primary drivers of limiting the BB management. BB emission will alleviate in NCP and aggravate in NEP. For the further emission reduction, effective measures for corn sources management, straw returning and rural energy utilization should be systematically considered. This research provides a clear evidence for the multi-year variation pattern of BB emissions, which is critical for pollution prediction, air quality modeling and targeted mitigation strategies for the key regions of China.

Detection of Aerosols above Clouds BASED on GCOM-C/SGLI Measurements,"The Japanese mission GCOM-C launched in 2017 loads only SGLI imager. SGLI is multi-spectral sensor including near-UV and two polarization channels. This work enhanced the advantages of SGLI feature in aerosol remote sensing. It was shown that the near-UV data not only detected absorbing aerosols such as biomass burning aerosols (BBA) or mineral dust (DUST), but was also used to distinguish between BBA and DUST with short-IR data. For leading issues such as aerosols above clouds, the detection of optically thick clouds was challenged in a similar manner to aerosol classification as well as utilization of polarization measurements. As a result, some scenes concerned with DUST or BBA above water clouds were practically detected. Â© 2020 IEEE.",
An exploratory approach using regression and machine learning in the analysis of mass absorption cross section of black carbon aerosols: Model development and evaluation,"Mass absorption cross-section of black carbon (MACBC) describes the absorptive cross-section per unit mass of black carbon, and is, thus, an essential parameter to estimate the radiative forcing of black carbon. Many studies have sought to estimate MACBC from a theoretical perspective, but these studies require the knowledge of a set of aerosol properties, which are difficult and/or labor-intensive to measure. We therefore investigate the ability of seven data analytical approaches (including different multivariate regressions, support vector machine, and neural networks) in predicting MACBC for both ambient and biomass burning measurements. Our model utilizes multi-wavelength light absorption and scattering as well as the aerosol size distributions as input variables to predict MACBC across different wavelengths. We assessed the applicability of the proposed approaches in estimating MACBC using different statistical metrics (such as coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error (MSE), fractional error, and fractional bias). Overall, the approaches used in this study can estimate MACBC appropriately, but the prediction performance varies across approaches and atmospheric environments. Based on an uncertainty evaluation of our models and the empirical and theoretical approaches to predict MACBC, we preliminarily put forth support vector machine (SVM) as a recommended data analytical technique for use. We provide an operational tool built with the approaches presented in this paper to facilitate this procedure for future users. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",
Greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation measures within the forestry and other land use subsector in Malawi,"Analysing past trends of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remains indispensable to the understanding of current GHG emissions, thereby enabling prediction of future emissions as well as development of their mitigative pathways. This study quantified GHG emissions within the Forest and Other Land Use (FOLU) subsector in Malawi for the period 2011 to 2020. Results indicate that Malawiâ€™s GHG emissions in the FOLU subsector fluctuated but decreased by 0.84 MtCO2e (13%) from 2011 to 2020, averaging to -1.3% annually. The GHG emissions of different categories within the subsector were highly significant (p < 0.001) and contributed the highest (99.72%) of the total variation. Forestland contributed the highest (74%) of the subsector category emissions, followed by biomass burning (19%). The uncertainties for the estimated GHG emissions were low (<15%). This shows that the estimated GHG emissions within the FOLU subsector were significantly minimised. Notable interventions that have abated the emissions include afforestation and natural/assisted regeneration; protection and conservation of protected areas through the REDD+ mechanism; establishment of seed banks for raising drought-tolerant tree species; and breeding of fast-growing and drought-tolerant tree species; as well as screening of disease and pest-resistant species and promotion of biological control.

A high-resolution emission inventory of air pollutants from primary crop residue burning over Northern India based on VIIRS thermal anomalies,"Emissions from the crop residue burning adversely affect the regional and global air quality including public health. In this study, a district-wise comprehensive emission inventory of key pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, CO2, SO2, NOx, N2O, NH3, CH4, NMVOC, EC, OC, PAH) emitted during primary crop residue burning was developed using activity data for the major agrarian states of north India for the agricultural year 2017â€“18. The emissions were scaled to the spatial resolution of 1 km grid to study the spatial distribution of crop residue burning activities using VIIRS Thermal anomalies datasets. An estimated 20.3 Mt and 9.6 Mt of crop residue were burned in Punjab and Haryana, resulting in an emission of 137.2 Gg and 56.9 Gg of PM2.5 and 163.7 Gg and 72.1 of PM10 Gg for respective states. The emissions of EC, OC, and PAHs were 8.6 Gg, 45.7 Gg, and 0.08 Gg in Punjab, whereas in Haryana emissions were 3.7 Gg, 17.7 Gg, and 0.03 Gg, respectively. The results show that rice and wheat crops were major contributor to residue burnt at the field (>90%) leading to the high load of atmospheric emissions in the IGP region. Further, CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions were 34.8 Tg and 17.3 Tg for Punjab and Haryana, respectively. Around 30000 and 8500 active fires were detected by VIIRS over the agricultural area of Punjab and Haryana during the studied year. The GIS-based bottom-up approach using gridded emission inventory shows pollutant distribution dominates over the south-western part of Punjab and north-western region of Haryana. The proximity of these regions to Delhi and transboundary movement of emissions towards Indo-Gangetic plains causes high air pollution episodes. The high-resolution inventory of various pollutants will be useful for regional air quality models to better predict and manage the hotspot of air pollution.

Leukemia and PAHs levels in human blood serum: Preliminary results from an adult cohort in Greece,"This study focused on the evaluation of any possible relationship of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their hydroxylated derivatives, originated from different anthropogenic activities, with leukemia via determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons levels in human blood serum. It attempts to provide a sufficient profile of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives in leukemia patients (cases) and healthy donors (controls) in Greece, for which pertinent data is lacking. The determination was applied to 198 serum samples, including cases and controls. Demographic and environmental data, such as age, gender, smoking habits and area of residence were subjected to clustered analysis during the statistical treatment of the results. The results demonstrated a statistically significant difference between cases and controls regarding polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations, with phenanthrene, fluorene and acenaphthene being the most abundant compounds (<19 ng mLâˆ’1). The same difference was also observed for hydroxylated derivatives measured in cases of acute leukemia and controls, with 1-hydroxy phenanthrene and 1-hydroxy pyrene appearing more enriched, with their median concentrations calculated at 11.3 and 7.6 ng mLâˆ’1, respectively. Source apportionment tools were employed for the evaluation of any potential associations among polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and several parameters. Molecular diagnostic ratios, applied in the classified data, indicated mainly that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons detected particularly in patients from rural sites could be originated from wood, grass or biomass burning. Principal Component Analysis, performed for overall and classified data, indicated a bioaccumulation of high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with age and chronic types of leukemia and a possible common origin of these toxic compounds in cases of smokers living in industrial residence areas.

"Long-term profiling of aerosol light extinction, particle mass, cloud condensation nuclei, and ice-nucleating particle concentration over Dushanbe, Tajikistan, in Central Asia","For the first time, continuous, vertically resolved long-term aerosol measurements were conducted with a state-of-the-art multiwavelength lidar over a Central Asian site. Such observations are urgently required in efforts to predict future climate and environmental conditions and to support spaceborne remote sensing (ground truth activities). The lidar observations were performed in the framework of the Central Asian Dust Experiment (CADEX) at Dushanbe, Tajikistan, from March 2015 to August 2016. An AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sun photometer was operated at the lidar field site. During the 18-month campaign, mixtures of continental aerosol pollution and mineral dust were frequently detected from ground to cirrus height level. Regional sources of dust and pollution as well as long-range transport of mineral dust mainly from Middle Eastern and the Saharan deserts determine the aerosol conditions over Tajikistan. In this study, we summarize our findings and present seasonally resolved statistics regarding aerosol layering (main aerosol layer depth, lofted layer occurrence); optical properties (aerosol and dust optical thicknesses at 500-532 nm, vertically resolved light-extinction coefficient at 532 nm); profiles of dust and non-dust mass concentrations and dust fraction; and profiles of particle parameters relevant for liquid water, mixed-phase cloud, and cirrus formation such as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations. The main aerosol layer over Dushanbe typically reaches 4-5 km height in spring to autumn. Frequently lofted dust-containing aerosol layers were observed at heights from 5 to 10 km, indicating a sensitive potential of dust to influence cloud ice formation. Typical dust mass fractions were of the order of 60 %-80 %. A considerable fraction is thus anthropogenic pollution and biomass burning smoke. The highest aerosol pollution levels (in the relatively shallow winter boundary layer) occur during the winter months. The seasonal mean 500 nm AOT (aerosol optical thickness) ranges from 0.15 in winter to 0.36 in summer during the CADEX period (March 2015 to August 2016); DOTs (dust optical thicknesses) were usually below 0.2; seasonally mean particle extinction coefficients were of the order of 100-500Mm-1 in the main aerosol layer during the summer half year and about 100-150Mm-1 in winter but were mainly caused by anthropogenic haze. Accordingly, the highest dust mass concentrations occurred in the summer season (200-600 Î¼gm-3) and the lowest during the winter months (20-50 Î¼gm-3) in the main aerosol layer. In winter, the aerosol pollution mass concentrations were 20- 50 Î¼gm-3, while during the summer half year (spring to autumn), the mass concentration caused by urban haze and biomass burning smoke decreases to 10-20 Î¼gm-3 in the lower troposphere. The CCN concentration levels are always controlled by aerosol pollution. The INP concentrations were found to be high enough in the middle and upper troposphere to significantly influence ice formation in mixed-phase and ice clouds during spring and summer seasons.

Analyzing Wildland Fire Smoke Emissions Data Using Compositional Data Techniques,"By conservation of mass, the mass of wildland fuel that is pyrolyzed and combusted must equal the mass of smoke emissions, residual char, and ash. For a given set of conditions, these amounts are fixed. This places a constraint on smoke emissions data that violates key assumptions for many of the statistical methods ordinarily used to analyze these data such as linear regression, analysis of variance, and t tests. These data are inherently multivariate, relative, and nonnegative parts of a whole and are then characterized as so-called compositional data. This paper introduces the field of compositional data analysis to the biomass burning emissions community and provides examples of statistical treatment of emissions data. Measures and tests of proportionality, unlike ordinary correlation, allow one to coherently investigate associations between parts of the smoke composition. An alternative method based on compositional linear trends was applied to estimate trace gas composition over a range of combustion efficiency that reduced prediction error by 4% while avoiding use of modified combustion efficiency as if it were an independent variable. Use of log-ratio balances to create meaningful contrasts between compositional parts definitively stressed differences in smoke emissions from fuel types originating in the southeastern and southwestern United States. Application of compositional statistical methods as an appropriate approach to account for the relative nature of data about the composition of smoke emissions and the atmosphere is recommended.

To What Extent Biomass Burning Aerosols Impact South America Seasonal Climate Predictions?,"We applied the Goddard Earth Observing System for subseasonal to seasonal climate prediction to assess the impact of inclusion biomass burning (BB) aerosols over South America (SA) during the austral winter. We also evaluated the model sensitivity to the BB emissions prescription using no emissions, monthly climatological, and daily emissions. Each hindcast consisted of four members running from June to November of each year between 2000 and 2015. Our results indicated that interactive BB aerosols improve the seasonal climate prediction performance over SA. More realistic daily based emissions significantly further improve the performance in comparison with the climatological ones. Therefore, improvements in the BB emissions representation are urged to represent the aerosol impacts on seasonal climate prediction performance adequately. Â© 2020. American Geophysical Union.

"Evaluation of PM2.5 forecast using chemical data assimilation in the WRF-Chem model: A novel initiative under the Ministry of Earth Sciences Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, India","Air quality has become one of the most important environmental concerns for Delhi, India. In this per-spective, we have developed a high-resolution air quali-ty prediction system for Delhi based on chemical data assimilation in the chemical transport model-Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The data assimilation system was ap-plied to improve the PM2.5 forecast via assimilation of MODIS aerosol optical depth retrievals using three-dimensional variational data analysis scheme. Near real-time MODIS fire count data were applied simul-taneously to adjust the fire-emission inputs of chemi-cal species before the assimilation cycle. Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from biomass burning, an-thropogenic emissions, and CO inflow from the do-main boundaries were tagged to understand the contribution of local and non-local emission sources.

Anti-HLA class II antibodies correlate with C-reactive protein levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis associated with interstitial lung disease,"The pathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is not fully understood, probably influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) is an extra-articular manifestation of RA, which contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. The identification of anti-HLA antibodies has been useful in the transplantation field; however, its contribution to autoimmune diseases as RA has not been fully studied. We aimed to determine the presence of anti-HLA antibodies in RA patients with and without ILD and its possible association with clinical and biochemical markers. One-hundred and forty-seven RA patients, of which 65 had ILD (RA-ILD group), were included. Sera samples for Anti-HLA Class II LABScreen panel-reactive antibodies (PRA) were analyzed. In both groups, women predominated, and lung function was worse in patients with ILD. The anti-CCP+ (UI/mL) was higher in the RA group in comparison to RA-ILD (p < 0.001). Expositional risk factors (tobacco smoking and biomass-burning smoke) were higher in RA-ILD patients. PRA+ was identified in ~25% RA-ILD patients, while ~29% in the RA group. The CRP levels have a positive correlation with the percentage of reactivity (%PRA, p = 0.02, r2 = 0.60) in the RA-ILD group. In conclusion, anti-HLA antibodies correlate with C-reactive protein levels in RA patients with ILD. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",
A Bayesian network model for prediction and analysis of possible forest fire causes,"Possible causes of a forest fire ignition could be human-caused (arson, smoking, hunting, picnic fire, shepherd fire, stubble burning) or natural-caused (lightning strikes, power lines). Temperature, relative humidity, tree species, distance from road, wind speed, distance from agricultural land, amount of burnt area, month and distance from settlement are the risk factors that may affect the occurrence of forest fires. This study introduces the use of Bayesian network model to predict the possible forest fire causes, as well as to perform an analysis of the multilateral interactive relations among them. The study was conducted in Mugla Regional Directorate of Forestry area located in the southwest of Turkey. The fire data, which were recorded between 2008 and 2018 in the area, were provided by General Directorate of Forestry. In this study, after applying some different structural learning algorithms, a Bayesian network, which is built on the nodes relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, month, distance from settlement, amount of burnt area, distance from agricultural land, distance from road and tree species, was estimated. The model showed that month is the first and temperature is the second most effective factor on the forest fire ignitions. The Bayesian network model approach adopted in this study could also be used with data obtained from different areas having different sizes. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",
"Air pollution in New Delhi, India: Source detection and prediction of seasonal variations in pollutant concentrations using machine learning","Today, air pollution is a major global environmental risk to our health and food security. The drastic degradation of air quality in leading metropolitan cities is a matter of serious concern. An astounding twenty-one of the world's top 30 worst AQI (Air Quality Index) ranked cities are in India and New Delhi is the world's most polluted capital city. This paper aims to identify the causes of air pollution in New Delhi, India by tracing the trajectories of air pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. The pollution in New Delhi reaches an annual high during the month of October. This has been attributed to crop residue burning (stubble burning) in the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana. The time of commencement of stubble burning is recognized by remote-sensing an abrupt decrease in wheat and paddy crop cover in Punjab and Haryana. Beginning from this time, the backward air mass trajectories are observed using the HYSPLIT model and the concentrations of the pollutants are predicted using a neural network model. The model is trained and tested on the datasets obtained from Sentinel-5P (Pollutant Concentration), ERA5 Daily aggregates (Surface temperature and Total precipitation), and GLDAS-2.1 (Wind speed). The air quality of New Delhi can be obtained beforehand from the model during the study period. This shall help regulatory authorities to take the necessary precautionary measures for combating air pollution. The trajectories observed and the model constructed substantiate the correlation between stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana and the aggravation of air pollution in New Delhi in the post-monsoon season.

Excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy for combustion generated particulate matter source identification,"The inhalation of particulate matter (PM) is a significant health risk associated with reduced life expectancy due to increased cardio-pulmonary disease and exacerbation of respiratory diseases such as asthma and pneumonia. PM originates from natural and anthropogenic sources including combustion engines, cigarettes, agricultural burning, and forest fires. Identifying the source of PM can inform effective mitigation strategies and policies, but this is difficult to do using current techniques. Here we present a method for identifying PM source using excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and a machine learning algorithm. We collected combustion generated PM2.5 from wood burning, diesel exhaust, and cigarettes using filters. Filters were weighted to determine mass concentration followed by extraction into cyclohexane and analysis by EEM fluorescence spectroscopy. Spectra obtained from each source served as training data for a convolutional neural network (CNN) used for source identification in mixed samples. This method can predict the presence or absence of the three laboratory sources with an overall accuracy of 89% when the threshold for classifying a source as present is 1.1 Î¼g/m3 in air over a 24-h sampling time. The limit of detection for cigarette, diesel and wood are 0.7, 2.6, 0.9 Î¼g/m3, respectively, in air assuming a 24-h sampling time at an air sampling rate of 1.8 L per minute. We applied the CNN algorithm developed using the laboratory training data to a small set of field samples and found the algorithm was effective in some cases but would require a training data set containing more samples to be more broadly applicable.

Characterization of rice straw from major cultivars for best alternative industrial uses to cutoff the menace of straw burning,"Rice straw is a useful bio-resource with worldwide annual production of approximately 731 million tons. However, this valuable biomass is unfortunately burnt on field as waste that causes air pollution, global warming, plant nutrient losses and environment menace. About 60% of rice straw produced in Asia in general and India in particular is burnt in field. As for the basic requirement to predict their suitability for best alternative industrial uses biochemical, morphological and chemical (functional group) characterization of straws of 18 most widely grown rice cultivars from eastern region of India was carried out. Biochemical characterization was done on the basis of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and silica content. The surface morphology of straws was observed through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), while, presence of functional groups were analyzed through Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Primarily, quantified biochemical profiles were used to group cultivars for best alternate uses of straw like bio-ethanol, biochar, compost and mushroom production. Morphological feature (from SEM) of straw and functional group (through FTIR) were used to support the grouping. Cultivars with higher hemicelluloses and cellulose with low to medium lignin and Si were better suited for bio-ethanol production while, straw having higher lignin and low to medium cellulose and hemicellulose were selected for biochar. Therefore, considering all the three characterization methods (chemical composition, morphological features, presence or absence of functional groups), we found straws of rice cultivars, Tapaswini and IR 64 were best suited for bio-ethanol and biochar production, respectively. There are overlapping as well as contradictory observations found during grouping, when the three approaches were followed together. This indicate that the grouping of straw for better alternative uses could be done by biochemical and morphological characterization but this should be validated in small scale at farm or factory level for final recommendation.

Impacts of biomass burning emission inventories and atmospheric reanalyses on simulated PM10 over Indochina,"Abstract: Biomass burning (BB) is a major source of atmospheric particles over Indochina during the dry season. Moreover, Indochina has convoluted meteorological scales, and regional meteorological conditions dominate the transport patterns of pollutants. This study focused on the impacts of BB emission inventories and atmospheric reanalyses on simulated PM10 over Indochina in 2014 using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Meteorological fields to input to CMAQ were produced by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation with the United States National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final (NCEP FNL) Operational Global Analysis or European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (ERA-interim). The Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN) vl.5 or the Global Fire Emissions Database including small fires (GFED v4.1s) was selected for BB emissions for the air quality simulation. The simulation case with NCEP FNL and FINN vl.5 (FNL + FINN) performed best throughout 2014, including the season when BB activities were intensified. The normalized percentage difference for maximum daily mean PMjo concentrations at Chiang Mai for FNL + FINN and the two simulation cases applying GFED v4.1s for BB emissions (-53% to-27%) was much larger than that between the FNL + FINN and ERA + FINN cases (10%). BB emission inventories more strongly impacted PMjq simulation than atmospheric reanalyses in highly polluted areas by BB over Indochina in 2014. Â© 2020 by the authors.",
Aerosol-type classification based on AERONET version 3 inversion products,"This study proposes an aerosol-type classification based on the particle linear depolarization ratio (PLDR) and single-scattering albedo (SSA) provided in the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) version 3 level 2.0 inversion product. We compare our aerosol-type classification with an earlier method that uses fine-mode fraction (FMF) and SSA. Our new method allows for a refined classification of mineral dust that occurs as a mixture with other absorbing aerosols: Pure dust (PD), dust-dominated mixed plume (DDM), and pollutant-dominated mixed plume (PDM). We test the aerosol classification at AERONET sites in East Asia that are frequently affected by mixtures of Asian dust and biomass-burning smoke or anthropogenic pollution. We find that East Asia is strongly affected by pollution particles with high occurrence frequencies of 50% to 67%. The distribution and types of pollution particles vary with location and season. The frequency of PD and dusty aerosol mixture (DDM+PDM) is slightly lower (34% to 49%) than pollution-dominated mixtures. Pure dust particles have been detected in only 1% of observations. This suggests that East Asian dust plumes generally exist in a mixture with pollution aerosols rather than in pure form. In this study, we have also considered data from selected AERONET sites that are representative of anthropogenic pollution, biomass-burning smoke, and mineral dust. We find that average aerosol properties obtained for aerosol types in our PLDR-SSA-based classification agree reasonably well with those obtained at AERONET sites representative for different aerosol types.

Using a low-cost sensor array and machine learning techniques to detect complex pollutant mixtures and identify likely sources,"An array of low-cost sensors was assembled and tested in a chamber environment wherein several pollutant mixtures were generated. The four classes of sources that were simulated were mobile emissions, biomass burning, natural gas emissions, and gasoline vapors. A two-step regression and classification method was developed and applied to the sensor data from this array. We first applied regression models to estimate the concentrations of several compounds and then classification models trained to use those estimates to identify the presence of each of those sources. The regression models that were used included forms of multiple linear regression, random forests, Gaussian process regression, and neural networks. The regression models with human-interpretable outputs were investigated to understand the utility of each sensor signal. The classification models that were trained included logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. The best combination of models was determined by maximizing the F1 score on ten-fold cross-validation data. The highest F1 score, as calculated on testing data, was 0.72 and was produced by the combination of a multiple linear regression model utilizing the full array of sensors and a random forest classification model.

AGRICULTURAL FIRES AND HEALTH AT BIRTH,"Fire has long served as a tool in agriculture, but the practiceâ€™s link with economic activity has made its health consequences difficult to study. Drawing on data from satellite-based fire detection systems, air monitors, and vital records in Brazil, we study how in utero exposure to smoke from sugarcane harvest fires affects health at birth. Exploiting daily changes in fire location and wind direction for identification, we find that late-pregnancy smoke exposure decreases birthweight, gestational length, and in utero survival. Fires less associated with smoke exposure predict improved health, highlighting the importance of disentangling pollution from its economic correlates.

The FireWork v2.0 air quality forecast system with biomass burning emissions from the Canadian Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System v2.03,"Biomass burning activities can produce large quantities of smoke and result in adverse air quality conditions in regional environments. In Canada, the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) operational FireWork (v1.0) air quality forecast system incorporates near-realtime biomass burning emissions to forecast smoke plumes from fire events. The system is based on the ECCC operational Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS) augmented with near-real-time wildfire emissions using inputs from the Canadian Forest Service (CFS) Canadian Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS). Recent improvements to the representation of fire behaviour and fire emissions have been incorporated into the CFS Canadian Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System (CFFEPS) v2.03. This is a bottom-up system linked to CWFIS in which hourly changes in biomass fuel consumption are parameterized with hourly forecasted meteorology at fire locations. CFFEPS has now also been connected to FireWork. In addition, a plumerise parameterization based on fire-energy thermodynamics is used to define the smoke injection height and the distribution of emissions within a model vertical column. The new system, FireWork v2.0 (FireWork-CFFEPS), has been evaluated over North America for July-September 2017 and June- August 2018, which are both periods when western Canada experienced historical levels of fire activity with poor air quality conditions in several cities as well as other fires affecting northern Canada and Ontario. Forecast results were evaluated against hourly surface measurements for the three pollutant species used to calculate the Canadian Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), namely PM2:5, O3, and NO2, and benchmarked against the operational FireWork v1.0 system (FireWork-Ops). This comparison shows improved forecast performance and predictive skills for the FireWork-CFFEPS system. Modelled fire-plume injection heights from CFFEPS based on fire-energy thermodynamics show higher plume injection heights and larger variability. The changes in predicted fire emissions and injection height reduced the consistent over-predictions of PM2:5 and O3 seen in FireWorkOps. On the other hand, there were minimal fire emission contributions to surface NO2, and results from FireWork- CFFEPS do not degrade NO2 forecast skill compared to the RAQDPS. Model performance statistics are slightly better for Canada than for the US, with lower errors and biases. The new system is still unable to capture the hourly variability of the observed values for PM2:5, but it captured the observed hourly variability for O3 concentration adequately. FireWork-CFFEPS also improves upon FireWork-Ops categorical scores for forecasting the occurrence of elevated air pollutant concentrations in terms of false alarm ratio (FAR) and critical success index (CSI).

A size-resolved chemical mass balance (SR-CMB) approach for source apportionment of ambient particulate matter by single element analysis,"The size distribution of a particle population has proven to be of great value in source apportionment studies. Previous studies have reported that particle size distributions in ambient urban air vary with location and time, indicating that the ambient particles are affected by known sources. However, the size distributions of individual chemical species emitted from primary sources have received relatively little attention. This study presents a preliminary real-world investigation of the size distributions of particles emissions from coal-fired power plants, residential coal combustion, biomass burning, vehicles, soil dust and steelworks based on a high size-resolution measurement using an Electrical Low Pressure Impactor. The size profiles of individual chemical elements are found to have a high degree of source specificity, which assists source classification. We subsequently employed a chemical mass balance approach termed size-resolved CMB (SR-CMB), which is based on the use of both physical and chemical information on the high size-resolution measurements of particulate matter. By applying SR-CMB on the measured ambient data, source contributions to ambient particles were successfully obtained when copper (Cu) was chosen as the fitting species. The approach described in this paper enhances the capability of the CMB model and provides a useful tool to validate results of traditional receptor models when a high size-resolution measurement is available. This effort also highlights that the size profiles of sources is of potential concern in the situations when the chemically collinear sources exist. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",
Is there an aerosol signature of chemical cloud processing?,"The formation of sulfate and secondary organic aerosol mass in the aqueous phase (aqSOA) of cloud and fog droplets can significantly contribute to ambient aerosol mass. While tracer compounds give evidence that aqueousphase processing occurred, they do not reveal the extent to which particle properties have been modified in terms of mass, chemical composition, hygroscopicity, and oxidation state. We analyze data from several field experiments and model studies for six air mass types (urban, biogenic, marine, wild fire biomass burning, agricultural biomass burning, and background air) using aerosol size and composition measurements for particles 13-850 nm in diameter. We focus on the trends of changes in mass, hygroscopicity parameter Îº, and oxygen-to-carbon (O = C) ratio due to chemical cloud processing. We find that the modification of these parameters upon cloud processing is most evident in urban, marine, and biogenic air masses, i.e., air masses that are more polluted than very clean air (background air) but cleaner than heavily polluted plumes as encountered during biomass burning. Based on these trends, we suggest that the mass ratio (Rtot) of the potential aerosol sulfate and aqSOA mass to the initial aerosol mass can be used to predict whether chemical cloud processing will be detectable. Scenarios in which this ratio exceeds Rtot ~ 0:5 are the most likely ones in which clouds can significantly change aerosol parameters. It should be noted that the absolute value of Rtot depends on the considered size range of particles. Rtot is dominated by the addition of sulfate (Rsulf) in all scenarios due to the more efficient conversion of SO2 to sulfate compared to aqSOA formation from organic gases. As the formation processes of aqSOA are still poorly understood, the estimate of RaqSOA is likely associated with large uncertainties. Comparison to Rtot values as calculated for ambient data at different locations validates the applicability of the concept to predict a chemical cloud-processing signature in selected air masses.

Neural network predictions of pollutant emissions from open burning of crop residues: Application to air quality forecasts in southern China,"Open burning of crop residues is a strong seasonal source of air pollutants in many parts of China, but the large day-to-day variability of the associated emissions pose a great challenge for air quality forecasts. Here we developed back-propagation neural network (BPNN) ensembles to forecast the daily fire pixel counts in Southern China during the month of January. The BPNN ensembles were trained using daily assimilated surface meteorological data (including air temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and winds) and daily fire pixel observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the month of January during the years 2003â€“2012. We showed that the BPNN ensembles successfully forecasted the day-to-day variability and the interannual variability of fire pixel counts over Southern China in January of the years 2013â€“2015, with correlation coefficients of 0.6â€“0.8 against the MODIS observations. We used the forecasted daily fire pixel counts in January 2014 and January 2015 to scale the climatological January biomass burning emissions from the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN) and applied the resulting forecasted daily biomass burning emissions to drive the WRF-Chem regional air quality model. The use of BPNN-ensemble-forecasted daily biomass burning pollutant emissions led to significant improvements in the daily forecasts of PM2.5 concentrations in Southern China for January 2014, with the mean bias of the simulated surface PM2.5 concentrations reduced from âˆ’9.1% to âˆ’1.2%. We repeated the sensitivity simulations for January 2015 and also found a modest improvement when using the forecasted daily biomass burning pollutant emissions (mean bias of the simulated surface PM2.5 concentrations reduced from âˆ’5.8% to âˆ’2%). Our approach can be applied to other source regions of biomass burning emissions to improve the accuracy of daily air quality forecasts. Â© 2019 The Author(s)",
Forecasting PM10 hourly concentrations in northern Italy: Insights on models performance and PM10 drivers through self-organizing maps,"A linear and an artificial neural network (ANN) statistical model have been developed and validated for short-term forecasting of PM10 hourly concentrations in the city of Brescia (Italy). PM10 observed concentrations were biased by less than 1% by each model, though the ANN outperformed the linear model, as exhibiting NRMSE of 0.48 vs. 0.53, and r2 of 0.57 vs. 0.48. The self-organizing maps (SOMs) showed that both models predictions exhibit the same clustering as the observations, with the ANN at worst capable of under-estimating clustered PM10 peak concentrations by 5.8 Î¼g/m3. In Brescia, PM10 most critical conditions were detected in wintertime in the early morning or late afternoon under unfavourable meteorological conditions, i.e. reduced advection enhancing PM10 stagnation, and lack of precipitations capable of reducing PM10 resuspension. Under these conditions, PM10 accumulation is driven by local anthropogenic emissions ascribing to two main sources: heating plants, responsible of emissions of primary PM10 (mostly PM2.5, likely resulting from wood and biomass burning); and road traffic (basically diesel vehicles), mainly responsible of emissions of secondary PM10 precursors (mostly NOx), and secondly of primary PM10 emissions. The SOM analysis clearly indicated that PM10 most critical conditions are driven by the secondary rather primary PM10 component. Â© 2018",
Algorithms for the classification and characterization of aerosols: Utility verification of near-UV satellite observations,"Aerosol types were characterized and classified using multispectral satellite data. The role of near-UV data in the detection of absorbing aerosols, such as biomass burning aerosols (BBA) or mineral dust particles (DUST), was examined on a global scale. An absorbing aerosol index (AAI) was proposed and defined as the ratio of the satellite-observed radiance (R) at a wavelength of 0.412 Î¼m [R (0.412)] to that at 0.380 Î¼m [R (0.380)] that can also detect nonabsorbing-type aerosols. Initially, the numerical AAI values were estimated for the BBAs and DUST from measurements collected by the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-2/Global Imager (ADEOS-2/GLI). The Japanese short mission ADEOS-2 carried the GLI instrument with observation channels in the near-UV region. Not only the AAI index but also the short-wavelength infrared measurements were utilized to determine the dust detection index (DDI) defined as the ratio of R (2.210) to R (0.380) in order to discriminate BBAs from DUST. In addition, the AAI and DDI values were evaluated for the detection of clouds. The results allowed the classification criteria for DUST, BBA, other types of aerosols and clouds to be obtained. The Second-Generation Global Imager (SGLI) sensor is onboard the Japanese Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C) (SHIKISAI in Japanese) satellite launched on December 23, 2017. The SGLI has multiple channels (19) including near-UV and polarization sensors in the red and near-IR wavelengths. We also demonstrated the advantages of the SGLI for near-UV and polarization data for aerosol remote sensing. An understanding of aerosol types facilitated subsequent aerosol retrieval. Then, retrieval for classified aerosols was made based on the radiation simulations with multispectral radiance by GLI and polarization measurements by Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER)-2, respectively, mounted on the ADEOS-2 satellite. The proposed algorithms are expected to be available not only for the analysis of the SGLI data but also for other future missions. Â© The Authors.

Intercomparison of MODIS AQUA and VIIRS I-band fires and emissions in an agricultural landscape-implications for air pollution research,"Quantifying emissions from crop residue burning is crucial as it is a significant source of air pollution. In this study, we first compared the fire products from two different sensors, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m active fire product (VNP14IMG) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1 km fire product (MCD14ML) in an agricultural landscape, Punjab, India. We then performed an intercomparison of three different approaches for estimating total particulate matter (TPM) emissions which includes the fire radiative power (FRP) based approach using VIIRS and MODIS data, the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) burnt area emissions and a bottom-up emissions approach involving agricultural census data. Results revealed that VIIRS detected fires were higher by a factor of 4.8 compared to MODIS Aqua and Terra sensors. Further, VIIRS detected fires were higher by a factor of 6.5 than Aqua. The mean monthly MODIS Aqua FRP was found to be higher than the VIIRS FRP; however, the sum of FRP from VIIRS was higher than MODIS data due to the large number of fires detected by the VIIRS. Besides, the VIIRS sum of FRP was 2.5 times more than the MODIS sum of FRP. MODIS and VIIRS monthly FRP data were found to be strongly correlated (r2 = 0.98). The bottom-up approach suggested TPM emissions in the range of 88.19-91.19 Gg compared to 42.0-61.71 Gg, 42.59-58.75 Gg and 93.98-111.72 Gg using the GFED, MODIS FRP, and VIIRS FRP based approaches, respectively. Of the different approaches, VIIRS FRP TPM emissions were highest. Since VIIRS data are only available since 2012 compared to MODIS Aqua data which have been available since May 2002, a prediction model combining MODIS and VIIRS FRP was derived to obtain potential TPM emissions from 2003-2016. The results suggested a range of 2.56-63.66 (Gg) TPM emissions per month, with the highest crop residue emissions during November of each year. Our results on TPM emissions for seasonality matched the ground-based data from the literature. As a mitigation option, stringent policy measures are recommended to curtail agricultural residue burning in the study area. Â© 2018 by the authors.",
An intercomparison of aerosol absorption measurements conducted during the SEAC4RS campaign,"During the SEAC4RS campaign in 2013, inflight measurements of light-absorption by aerosol in biomass burning and agriculture fire plumes were collected along with concomitant measurements of aerosol extinction, scattering, and black carbon mass concentration. Here, we compare three measurements of aerosol absorption coefficients: from a photoacoustic spectrometer (PAS), a particle soot absorption photometer (PSAP), and a continuous light absorption photometer (CLAP). Each of these absorption measurements was collected in three visible spectral regions: red, green, and blue (although the precise wavelength and bandwidth vary with each instrument). The absorption measurements were compared during the plumes, in the boundary layer, and in the free troposphere. The slopes from the comparison ranged from 0.6 to 1.24. For biomass burning plumes, the uncertainty in the absorption measurements translates into a range in single scattering albedos of 0.93â€“0.94 at a wavelength of 660 nm, 0.94â€“0.95 at 532 nm and 0.92â€“0.95 at 405 nm. Overall, the aerosol absorption instruments agreed within their stated accuracies. Comparisons with simultaneous measurements of refractive black carbon mass concentration (collected by a single particle soot photometer), were used to derive the mass absorption coefficients (MAC). For all wavelengths, the MAC was high by greater than a factor of three compared to the expected MAC for black carbon. Â© 2018 American Association for Aerosol Research.

A modeling study of the impact of crop residue burning on pm2.5 concentration in beijing and tianjin during a severe autumn haze event,"Crop residue burning is one of the important types of biomass burning in China and has potentially important effect on air quality and climate. A coupled meteorology and aerosol/chemistry model (WRF-Chem) with ground and satellite observations and biomass burning emission inventory were applied to investigate the spatial/temporal distribution and transport pathways of air pollutants and to quantify the contribution of crop residue burning to aerosol concentration in the North China Plain, with focus on Beijing and Tianjin during a severe haze episode on 7â€“11 October 2014, when the daily mean surface PM2.5 concentration in Beijing reached 317 Âµg mâ€“3. During this period, intensive crop fires were detected over wide areas of eastern Henan, southern Hebei and western Shandong, and the crop residue burning emission was much larger than anthropogenic emission in major fire areas. Model comparison with ground observations demonstrated the WRF-Chem was able to generally reproduce surface meteorological variables and PM2.5 concentration, although it tended to overpredict wind speed and aerosol concentration in some locations. Taking crop residue burning into account can apparently improve PM2.5 prediction during the haze episode. The stagnant weather condition favored haze formation and maintenance in this region, and crop residue burning intensified haze pollution in both fire source and downwind regions. The crop residue burning emission on average contributed 19% to surface PM2.5 concentration in Beijing during the haze episode, in which it contributed 40% and 29% to organic carbon aerosol and primary PM2.5, respectively, and less to black carbon aerosol (4.9%). The impact of crop residue burning in Tianjin was smaller than that in Beijing, with an average contribution of 7.4% due to different fire sources and transport pathways.

Identifying industrial heat sources using time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product with an object-oriented approach,"Carbon-based fuels burned at industrial facilities account for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and an up-to-date spatiotemporally detailed inventory is essential for a better understanding of global carbon emission patterns. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint-like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of ~ 77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.

Using the Fire Weather Index (FWI) to improve the estimation of fire emissions from fire radiative power (FRP) observations,"The atmospheric composition analysis and forecast for the European Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Services (CAMS) relies on biomass-burning fire emission estimates from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS). The GFAS is a global system and converts fire radiative power (FRP) observations from MODIS satellites into smoke constituents. Missing observations are filled in using persistence, whereby observed FRP values from the previous day are progressed in time until a new observation is recorded. One of the consequences of this assumption is an increase of fire duration, which in turn translates into an increase of emissions estimated from fires compared to what is available from observations. In this study persistence is replaced by modelled predictions using the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), which describes how atmospheric conditions affect the vegetation moisture content and ultimately fire duration. The skill in predicting emissions from biomass burning is improved with the new technique, which indicates that using an FWI-based model to infer emissions from FRP is better than persistence when observations are not available.

Modeling of volatile organic compounds dispersion from open crop residue burning,"                             Burning of maize residues has been considered as a significant source of air pollution in the northern region of Thailand during the dry season. This study applied CALPUFF air dispersion model to predict ambient VOC concentrations released from maize residue open burning in the study area. VOC emission data in 2014 coupled with the meteorological data from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model were used as model input data. The model was simulated during January-April to predict 24-h average VOC concentrations and dispersions over the modeling domain of 100 Ã— 100 km                             2                              with 1 km grid resolution. Four VOCs including benzene, acrylonitrile, xylene, and acetaldehyde were evaluated for different burned area scenarios (100% or worst-case, 75%, 50%, and 25% maize acreage areas being burned at the same time). Predicted concentrations were compared to Thailand surveillance standards and the international ambient VOC guidelines on the 24-h average basis. The results revealed that VOC concentrations from the worst-case scenario exceeded the guidelines. Reducing burned areas could decrease the maximum VOC concentrations; however, the levels of some VOCs were still higher than the guideline values. The highest value was predicted in January due to its lower wind speed as compared to other months. Therefore, we suggested that the intermittent control scheme of zero burning should be more stringent in the study area during the burning season for reducing the impacts on air quality and public health.

Volume changes upon heating of aerosol particles from biomass burning using transmission electron microscopy,"The responses of aerosol particles to heating are important for measurements of their chemical, physical, and optical properties, classification, and determination of origin. However, the thermal behavior of organic aerosol particles is largely unknown. We provide a method to analyze such thermal behavior through heating from room temperature to >600Â°C by using a heating holder within a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Here we describe in-situ shape and size changes and variations in the compositions of individual particles before and after heating. We use ambient samples from wildland and agricultural biomass fires in North America collected during the 2013 Biomass Burning Observation Project (BBOP). The results indicate that individual tar balls (TB; spherical organic material) from biomass burning retained, on average, up to 30% of their volume when heated to 600Â°C. Chemical analysis reveals that K and Na remain in the residues, whereas S and O were lost. In contrast to bulk sample measurements of carbonaceous particles using thermal/optical carbon analyzers, our single-particle results imply that many individual organic particles consist of multiple types of organic matter having different thermal stabilities. Beyond TBs, our results suggest that because of their thermal stability some organic particles may not be detectable by using aerosol mass spectrometry or thermal/optical carbon analyzers. This result can lead to an underestimate of the abundance of TBs and other organic particles, and therefore biomass burning may have more influence than currently recognized in regional and global climate models.

Seasonal variations of C1-C4 alkyl nitrates at a coastal site in Hong Kong: Influence of photochemical formation and oceanic emissions,"Five C1-C4 alkyl nitrates (RONO2) were measured at a coastal site in Hong Kong in four selected months of 2011 and 2012. The total mixing ratios of C1-C4 RONO2 (Î£5RONO2) ranged from 15.4 to 143.7 pptv with an average of 65.9 Â± 33.0 pptv. C3-C4 RONO2 (2-butyl nitrate and 2-propyl nitrate) were the most abundant RONO2 during the entire sampling period. The mixing ratios of C3-C4 RONO2 were higher in winter than those in summer, while the ones of methyl nitrate (MeONO2) were higher in summer than those in winter. Source analysis suggests that C2-C4 RONO2 were mainly derived from photochemical formation along with biomass burning (58.3â€“71.6%), while ocean was a major contributor to MeONO2 (53.8%) during the whole sampling period. The photochemical evolution of C2-C4 RONO2 was investigated, and found to be dominantly produced by the parent hydrocarbon oxidation. The notable enrichment of MeONO2 over C3-C4 RONO2 was observed in a summer episode when the air masses originating from the South China Sea (SCS) and MeONO2 was dominantly derived from oceanic emissions. In order to improve the accuracy of ozone (O3) prediction in coastal environment, the relative contribution of RONO2 from oceanic emissions versus photochemical formation and their coupling effects on O3 production should be taken into account in future studies.

Impacts of air pollutants from fire and non-fire emissions on the regional air quality in Southeast Asia,"Severe haze events in Southeast Asia caused by particulate pollution have become more intense and frequent in recent years. Widespread biomass burning occurrences and particulate pollutants from human activities other than biomass burning play important roles in degrading air quality in Southeast Asia. In this study, numerical simulations have been conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with a chemistry component (WRF-Chem) to quantitatively examine the contributions of aerosols emitted from fire (i.e., biomass burning) versus non-fire (including fossil fuel combustion, and road dust, etc.) sources to the degradation of air quality and visibility over Southeast Asia. These simulations cover a time period from 2002 to 2008 and are driven by emissions from (a) fossil fuel burning only, (b) biomass burning only, and (c) both fossil fuel and biomass burning. The model results reveal that 39 % of observed low-visibility days (LVDs) can be explained by either fossil fuel burning or biomass burning emissions alone, a further 20 % by fossil fuel burning alone, a further 8 % by biomass burning alone, and a further 5 % by a combination of fossil fuel burning and biomass burning. Analysis of an 24 h PM2.5 air quality index (AQI) indicates that the case with coexisting fire and non-fire PM2.5 can substantially increase the chance of AQI being in the moderate or unhealthy pollution level from 23 to 34 %. The premature mortality in major Southeast Asian cities due to degradation of air quality by particulate pollutants is estimated to increase from âˆ¼ 4110 per year in 2002 to âˆ¼ 6540 per year in 2008. In addition, we demonstrate the importance of certain missing non-fire anthropogenic aerosol sources including anthropogenic fugitive and industrial dusts in causing urban air quality degradation. An experiment of using machine learning algorithms to forecast the occurrence of haze events in Singapore is also explored in this study. All of these results suggest that besides minimizing biomass burning activities, an effective air pollution mitigation policy for Southeast Asia needs to consider controlling emissions from non-fire anthropogenic sources.

Improving forecasts of biomass burning emissions with the fire weather index,"In the absence of a dynamical fire model that could link the emissions to the weather dynamics and the availability of fuel, atmospheric composition models, such as the European Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Services (CAMS), often assume persistence, meaning that constituents produced by the biomass burning process during the first day are assumed constant for the whole length of the forecast integration (5 days for CAMS). While this assumption is simple and practical, it can produce unrealistic predictions of aerosol concentration due to an excessive contribution from biomass burning. This paper introduces a time-dependent factor M, which modulates the amount of aerosol emitted from fires during the forecast. The factor M is related to the daily change in fire danger conditions and is a function of the fire weather index (FWI). The impact of the new scheme was tested in the atmospheric composition model managed by the CAMS. Experiments from 5 months of daily forecasts in 2015 allowed for both the derivation of global statistics and the analysis of two big fire events in Indonesia and Alaska, with extremely different burning characteristics. The results indicate that time-modulated emissions based on the FWI calculations lead to predictions that are in better agreement with observations. Â© 2017 American Meteorological Society.",
Radiative effects of absorbing aerosols over northeastern India: Observations and model simulations,"Multiyear measurements of spectral properties of aerosol absorption are examined over four geographically distinct locations of northeastern India. Results indicated significant spatiotemporal variation in aerosol absorption coefficients (Ïƒabs) with highest values in winter and lowest in monsoon. The western parts of the region, close to the outflow of Indo-Gangetic Plains, showed higher values of Ïƒabs and black carbon (BC) concentrationâ€”mostly associated with fossil fuel combustion. But, the eastern parts showed higher contributions from biomass-burning aerosols, as much as 20â€“25% to the total aerosol absorption, conspicuously during premonsoon season. This is attributed to a large number of burning activities over the Southeast Asian region, as depicted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer fire count maps, whose spatial extent and magnitude peaks during March/April. The nearly consistent high values of aerosol index (AI) and layer height from Ozone Monitoring Instrument indicate the presence of absorbing aerosols in the upper atmosphere. The observed seasonality has been captured fairly well by Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) as well as Weather Research and Forecastingâ€“Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model simulations. The ratio of column-integrated optical depths due to particulate organic matter and BC from GOCART showed good coincidence with satellite-based observations, indicating the increased vertical dispersion of absorbing aerosols, probably by the additional local convection due to higher fire radiative power caused by the intense biomass-burning activities. In the WRF-Chem though underperformed by different magnitude in winter, the values are closer or overestimated near the burnt areas. Atmospheric forcing due to BC was highest (~30Wmâ€“2) over the western part associated with the fossil fuel combustion. Â© 2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",
Determination of enhancement ratios of HCOOH relative to CO in biomass burning plumes by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI),"Formic acid (HCOOH) concentrations are often underestimated by models, and its chemistry is highly uncertain. HCOOH is, however, among the most abundant atmospheric volatile organic compounds, and it is potentially responsible for rain acidity in remote areas. HCOOH data from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) are analyzed from 2008 to 2014 to estimate enhancement ratios from biomass burning emissions over seven regions. Fire-affected HCOOH and CO total columns are defined by combining total columns from IASI, geographic location of the fires from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the surface wind speed field from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Robust correlations are found between these fire-affected HCOOH and CO total columns over the selected biomass burning regions, allowing the calculation of enhancement ratios equal to 7.30g Ã— g 10g'3g Â±g 0.08g Ã— g 10g'3g molg molg'1 over Amazonia (AMA), 11.10g Ã— g 10g'3g Â±g 1.37g Ã— g 10g'3g molg molg'1 over Australia (AUS), 6.80g Ã— g 10g'3g Â±g 0.44g Ã— g 10g'3g molg molg'1 over India (IND), 5.80g Ã— g 10g'3g Â±g 0.15g Ã— g 10g'3g molg molg'1 over Southeast Asia (SEA), 4.00g Ã— g 10g'3g Â±g 0.19g Ã— g 10g'3g molg molg'1 over northern Africa (NAF), 5.00g Ã— g 10g'3g Â±g 0.13g Ã— g 10g'3g molg molg'1 over southern Africa (SAF), and 4.40g Ã— g 10g'3g Â±g 0.09g Ã— g 10g'3g molg molg'1 over Siberia (SIB), in a fair agreement with previous studies. In comparison with referenced emission ratios, it is also shown that the selected agricultural burning plumes captured by IASI over India and Southeast Asia correspond to recent plumes where the chemistry or the sink does not occur. An additional classification of the enhancement ratios by type of fuel burned is also provided, showing a diverse origin of the plumes sampled by IASI, especially over Amazonia and Siberia. The variability in the enhancement ratios by biome over the different regions show that the levels of HCOOH and CO do not only depend on the fuel types. Â© Author(s) 2017.",
Modeling study of biomass burning plumes and their impact on urban air quality; a case study of Santiago de Chile,"On January 4, 2014, during the summer period in South America, an intense forest and dry pasture wildfire occurred nearby the city of Santiago de Chile. On that day the biomass-burning plume was transported by low-intensity winds towards the metropolitan area of Santiago and impacted the concentration of pollutants in this region. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) is implemented to investigate the biomass-burning plume associated with these wildfires nearby Santiago, which impacted the ground-level ozone concentration and exacerbated Santiago's air quality. Meteorological variables simulated by WRF/Chem are compared against surface and radiosonde observations, and the results show that the model reproduces fairly well the observed wind speed, wind direction air temperature and relative humidity for the case studied. Based on an analysis of the transport of an inert tracer released over the locations, and at the time the wildfires were captured by the satellite-borne Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the model reproduced reasonably well the transport of biomass burning plume towards the city of Santiago de Chile within a time delay of two hours as observed in ceilometer data. A six day air quality simulation was performed: the first three days were used to validate the anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, and the last three days (during and after the wildfire event) to analyze the performance of WRF/Chem plume-rise model within FINNv1 fire emission estimations. The model presented a satisfactory performance on the first days of the simulation when contrasted against data from the well-established air quality network over the city of Santiago de Chile. These days represent the urban air quality base case for Santiago de Chile unimpacted by fire emissions. However, for the last three simulation days, which were impacted by the fire emissions, the statistical indices showed a decrease in the model performance. While the model showed a satisfactory evidence that wildfires plumes that originated in the vicinity of Santiago de Chile were transported towards the urban area and impacted the air quality, the model still underpredicted some pollutants substantially, likely due to misrepresentation of fire emission sources during those days. Potential uncertainties may include to the land use/land cover classifications and its characteristics, such as type and density of vegetation assigned to the region, where the fire spots are detected. The variability of the ecosystem type during the fire event might also play a role. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",
"Using VIIRS fire radiative power data to simulate biomass burning emissions, plume rise and smoke transport in a real-time air quality modeling system","In this presentation, we present a new smoke modeling system High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR-Smoke) to simulate biomass burning (BB) emissions, plume rise and smoke transport in real time. The HRRR model (without smoke) is run as an operational numerical weather prediction system at the National Weather Service. HRRR is NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory's version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Here we make use of WRF-Chem (the WRF model coupled with chemistry) and simulate fine particulate matter (smoke) emissions emitted by BB as well as anthropogenic sources. The model includes an aerosol aware double moment Thompson microphysics scheme [1], which allows to simulate smoke feedback on microphysics in a computationally efficient manner. Â© 2017 IEEE.",
Remote sensing measurements of aerosol optical properties during the 2015 Indonesian biomass burning,"Over the last two decades and due to rapid economic growth, the South-East Asia region experiences mild to severe smoke episodes generated from annual biomass burning events, usually occurring during the regions's dry season that can last several months (June to October). Such a events poses a hazard to the region itself and specially to Singapore due to close proximity to the land masses of Sumatra and Borneo. In-situ aerosol measurements are now performed by our AERONET link photometer (Singapore and Kuching) sites. Such measurements readily provide optical characterization of atmospheric aerosols when biomass burning events occur. In this work, we present an analysis of three months of AERONET level 1.5 data recorded during August-October 2015 period. Besides the classical aerosol optical depth and Angstrom exponent number classifications, a special emphasis is paid to separate the fine/coarse mode part of the particle size distribution and by applying strict constrains to avoid cloud contamination and other artifacts.

An evaluation of the impact of aerosol particles on weather forecasts from a biomass burning aerosol event over the Midwestern United States: Observational-based analysis of surface temperature,"A major continental-scale biomass burning smoke event from 28-30 June 2015, spanning central Canada through the eastern seaboard of the United States, resulted in unforecasted drops in daytime high surface temperatures on the order of 2-5Â°C in the upper Midwest. This event, with strong smoke gradients and largely cloud-free conditions, provides a natural laboratory to study how aerosol radiative effects may influence numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecast outcomes. Here, we describe the nature of this smoke event and evaluate the differences in observed near-surface air temperatures between Bismarck (clear) and Grand Forks (overcast smoke), to evaluate to what degree solar radiation forcing from a smoke plume introduces daytime surface cooling, and how this affects model bias in forecasts and analyses. For this event, mid-visible (550nm) smoke aerosol optical thickness (AOT, Ï„) reached values above 5. A direct surface cooling efficiency of g-1.5Â°C per unit AOT (at 550nm, Ï„550) was found. A further analysis of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) near-surface air temperature forecasts for up to 54h as a function of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Dark Target AOT data across more than 400 surface stations, also indicated the presence of the daytime aerosol direct cooling effect, but suggested a smaller aerosol direct surface cooling efficiency with magnitude on the order of-0.25 to-1.0Â°C per unit Ï„550. In addition, using observations from the surface stations, uncertainties in near-surface air temperatures from ECMWF, NCEP, and UKMO model runs are estimated. This study further suggests that significant daily changes in Ï„550 above 1, at which the smoke-aerosol-induced direct surface cooling effect could be comparable in magnitude with model uncertainties, are rare events on a global scale. Thus, incorporating a more realistic smoke aerosol field into numerical models is currently less likely to significantly improve the accuracy of near-surface air temperature forecasts. However, regions such as eastern China, eastern Russia, India, and portions of the Saharan and Taklamakan deserts, where significant daily changes in AOTs are more frequent, are likely to benefit from including an accurate aerosol analysis into numerical weather forecasts.

The FireWork air quality forecast system with near-real-time biomass burning emissions: Recent developments and evaluation of performance for the 2015 North American wildfire season,"Environment and Climate Change Canadaâ€™s FireWork air quality (AQ) forecast system for North America with near-real-time biomass burning emissions has been running experimentally during the Canadian wildfire season since 2013. The system runs twice per day with model initializations at 00 UTC and 12 UTC, and produces numerical AQ forecast guidance with 48-hr lead time. In this work we describe the FireWork system, which incorporates near-real-time biomass burning emissions based on the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS) as an input to the operational Regional Air Quality Deterministic Prediction System (RAQDPS). To demonstrate the capability of the system we analyzed two forecast periods in 2015 (June 2â€“July 15, and August 15â€“31) when fire activity was high, and observed fire-smoke-impacted areas in western Canada and the western United States. Modeled PM2.5 surface concentrations were compared with surface measurements and benchmarked with results from the operational RAQDPS, which did not consider near-real-time biomass burning emissions. Model performance statistics showed that FireWork outperformed RAQDPS with improvements in forecast hourly PM2.5 across the region; the results were especially significant for stations near the path of fire plume trajectories. Although the hourly PM2.5 concentrations predicted by FireWork still displayed bias for areas with active fires for these two periods (mean bias [MB] of â€“7.3 Âµg mâˆ’3 and 3.1 Âµg mâˆ’3), it showed better forecast skill than the RAQDPS (MB of â€“11.7 Âµg mâˆ’3 and â€“5.8 Âµg mâˆ’3) and demonstrated a greater ability to capture temporal variability of episodic PM2.5 events (correlation coefficient values of 0.50 and 0.69 for FireWork compared to 0.03 and 0.11 for RAQDPS). A categorical forecast comparison based on an hourly PM2.5 threshold of 30 Âµg mâˆ’3 also showed improved scores for probability of detection (POD), critical success index (CSI), and false alarm rate (FAR). Implications: Smoke from wildfires can have a large impact on regional air quality (AQ) and can expose populations to elevated pollution levels. Environment and Climate Change Canada has been producing operational air quality forecasts for all of Canada since 2009 and is now working to include near-real-time wildfire emissions (NRTWE) in its operational AQ forecasting system. An experimental forecast system named FireWork, which includes NRTWE, has been undergoing testing and evaluation since 2013. A performance analysis of FireWork forecasts for the 2015 wildfire season shows that FireWork provides significant improvements to surface PM2.5 forecasts and valuable guidance to regional forecasters and first responders.

Multivariate analysis of air quality in selected oil operating areas in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria,"This study assessed air quality in selected oil operating areas in Rivers State of Nigeria with consideration to land use type such as oil and gas facilities, major bus stops, schools, Markets, hospitals, residential areas, vegetation and commercial centers. Air quality and meteorological parameters across 25 locations were monitored during the wet season (April to October) 2015 to ascertain major air pollutant sources. The parameters monitored were, Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Carbon ii oxide (CO), Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM) 1, PM2.5, PM4, PM7, PM10, TSP, wind speed, humidity and temperature. Descriptive statistics, agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (AHCA), Principal component analysis (PCA), Multiple linear regression (MLR) and Principal component regression (PCR) were used in the data analysis and modeling of Air quality index. Results showed that SO2 values ranged from 0.04 ppm to 0.15 ppm, NO2 values ranged from 0.025 ppm to 0.162 ppm, CO concentration ranged from 0.24 ppm to 6.36 ppm, VOC values ranged from 0.18 ppm to 2.19 ppm across all study locations. Particulate matter also varied across the study locations. Three clusters were obtained from AHCA. The dendogram plot from AHCA showed that the observed variation can be attributed to the land use pattern in the study area. Three principal components were extracted from the PCA based on eigenvalue of >1 and from the biplot after varimax rotation revealed that the major sources of air pollution in the area based on land use type are markets, major bus stops, residential and commercial centers. Vehicular emissions, biomass burning and dusty roads are the major sources of air pollution in the study area. MLR performed better than PCR with MLR and PCR having an R2 of 0.967 and 0.930 respectively. PCA, AHCA, MLR and PCR proved to be useful tools in air quality analysis for source apportionment and prediction as this can aid in air pollution abatement planning. There is need to improve existing policies in other to proactively mitigate the impacts of air pollution from oil and non-oil operation sources. Copyright 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",
Assessment of biomass burning smoke influence on environmental conditions for multiyear tornado outbreaks by combining aerosol-aware microphysics and fire emission constraints,"We use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) system to study the impacts of biomass burning smoke from Central America on several tornado outbreaks occurring in the U.S. during spring. The model is configured with an aerosol-aware microphysics parameterization capable of resolving aerosol-cloudradiation interactions in a cost-efficient way for numerical weather prediction (NWP) applications. Primary aerosol emissions are included, andsmokeemissions are constrained using an inverse modeling technique and satellite-based aerosol optical depth observations. Simulations turning on and off fire emissions reveal smoke presence in all tornado outbreaks being studied and show an increase in aerosol number concentrations due to smoke. However, the likelihood of occurrence and intensification of tornadoes is higher due to smoke only in cases where cloud droplet number concentration in low-level clouds increases considerably in a way that modifies the environmental conditions where the tornadoes are formed (shallower cloud basesandhigher lowlevel wind shear). Smoke absorption and vertical extent also play a role, with smoke absorption at cloud-level tending to burn-off clouds and smoke absorption above clouds resulting in an increased capping inversion. Comparing these and WRF-Chem simulations configured with a more complex representation of aerosol size and composition and different optical properties, microphysics, and activation schemes, we find similarities in terms of the simulated aerosol optical depths and aerosol impacts on near-storm environments. This provides reliability on the aerosol-aware microphysics scheme as a less computationally expensive alternative to WRF-Chem for its use in applications such as NWP and cloud-resolving simulations.

Biomass combustion systems: A review on the physical and chemical properties of the ashes,"Biomass as an energy source contributes to a decrease in the dependence on imported fossil fuels, while at the same time, adding value to the countries where biomass fuel sources thrive, in addition to providing a source of renewable energy. Knowledge of the behaviour of fuel is essential in order to design and operate equipment safely and efficiently. In particular, knowledge about mineral content is essential because the ashes play an important role in the dynamics of the generation system. Through knowledge of the chemical composition and physical properties of the ashes, it is possible to predict the tendency to form deposits in the boiler components, as well as their potential to cause corrosion, erosion and abrasion. The behaviour of the ashes in the system is highly dependent on fuel, particularly when it comes from industrial waste or energy crops. These fuels have a higher mineral content, particularly sodium (Na), potassium (K), phosphorous (P) and chloride (Cl). They also have higher ash content with a low melting point and high corrosion potential. This paper focuses on the characteristics of the ashes derived from the combustion of biomass, with particular attention paid to the chemical transformations at high temperatures, as well as its effect on the combustion equipment. Emphasis is placed on the potential problems that occur when biomass-burning technologies are used for energy crops, in order to avoid catastrophic failures. It concludes with recommendations for the management, control and prevention of problems associated with ash. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
A comparative analysis of potential impact area of common sugar cane burning methods,"The negative effects of agricultural burning are well-known, although the actual impact area of different activities has not previously been quantified. An elastic backscatter lidar system was used to examine the impact-area size and dispersion of smoke generated from different types of sugarcane burning activities; pre-harvest (standing) burning and post-harvest (ground) burning. Experiments were conducted in the sugarcane harvest season of 2010 and 2011 at two locations in Louisiana, USA. Current dispersion theory would suggest that the primary difference between burn types would be primarily in the initial plume rise, but that the overall plume shape would remain the same. However, remotely sensed lidar data with the capability to measure plume dispersion and the short time dynamics of plume location showed pre-harvest (standing) burning produced a larger plume with greater rise and more spread within the 300m of the plume, but a decrease in dispersion, but not concentration further downwind. Post-harvest (ground) burning produced a more traditional plume shape, but still exceeded impact area predictions near the source. Moreover, large changes in plume size can occur with small increases in wind speed. These are the first instrumented measurements of the meteorological effects of the different types of sugarcane burning. These results indicate that ground burning is preferable, but should be avoided in lower wind speed conditions. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",
Spatial distribution of temporal dynamics in anthropogenic fires in miombo savanna woodlands of Tanzania,"Background: Anthropogenic uses of fire play a key role in regulating fire regimes in African savannas. These fires contribute the highest proportion of the globally burned area, substantial biomass burning emissions and threaten maintenance and enhancement of carbon stocks. An understanding of fire regimes at local scales is required for the estimation and prediction of the contributionof these fires to the global carbon cycle and for fire management. We assessed the spatio-temporal distribution of fires in miombo woodlands of Tanzania, utilizing the MODIS active fire product and Landsat satellite images for the past ~40years. Results: Our results show that up to 50.6% of the woodland area is affected by fire each year. An early and a late dry season peak in wetter and drier miombo, respectively, characterize the annual fire season. Wetter miombo areas have higher fire activity within a shorter annual fire season and have shorter return intervals. The fire regime is characterized by small-sized fires, with a higher ratio of small than large burned areas in the frequency-size distribution (Î²=2.16Â±0.04). Large-sized fires are rare, and occur more frequently in drier than in wetter miombo. Both fire prevalence and burned extents have decreased in the past decade. At a large scale, more than half of the woodland area has less than 2years of fire return intervals, which prevent the occurrence of large intense fires. Conclusion: The sizes of fires, season of burning and spatial extent of occurrence are generally consistent across time, at the scale of the current analysis. Where traditional use of fire is restricted, a reassessment of fire management strategies may be required, if sustainability of tree cover is a priority. In such cases, there is a need to combine traditional and contemporary fire management practices. Â© 2015 Tarimo et al.",
Nitrogen management is the key for low-emission wheat production in Australia: A life cycle perspective,"Farm management affects the global greenhouse gas (GHG) budget by changing not only soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions but also other pre-farm, on-farm and off-site emissions. The life cycle assessment (LCA) approach has been widely adopted to assess the ""carbon footprint"" of agricultural products, but rarely used as a tool to identify effective mitigation strategies. In this study, the global warming impacts of no-till (NT) vs. conventional till (CT), stubble retention (SR) vs. stubble burning (SB), and N fertilization (NF) vs. no N fertilization (N0) in an Australian wheat cropping system were assessed using in situ measurements of N2O fluxes over three years, SOC changes over forty years and including other supply chain GHG sources and sinks. The results demonstrated the importance of full GHG accounting compared to considering SOC changes or N2O emissions alone for assessing the global warming impacts of different management practices, and highlighted the significance of accurately accounting for SOC changes and N2O emissions in LCAs. The GHG footprints of wheat production were on averaged 475kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) ha-1 (or 186kg CO2-e t-1 grain) higher under NF than N0. Where fertilizer N was applied (70kgNha-1), the life cycle emissions were 200kg CO2-e ha-1 (or 87t-1 grain) lower under NT than CT and 364kg CO2-e ha-1 (or 155t-1 grain) lower under SR than SB. Classification of the emission sources/sinks and re-calculation of published data indicated that under the common practices of SR combined with NT, N-related GHG emissions contributed 60-95% of the life cycle emissions in the predominantly rain-fed wheat production systems in Australia. Therefore, future mitigation efforts should aim to improve N use efficiency, explore non-synthetic N sources, and most importantly avoid excessive N fertilizer use whilst practising NT and SR.

Global analysis of radiative forcing from fire-induced shortwave albedo change,"Land surface albedo, a key parameter to derive Earth's surface energy balance, is used in the parameterization of numerical weather prediction, climate monitoring and climate change impact assessments. Changes in albedo due to fire have not been fully investigated on a continental and global scale. The main goal of this study, therefore, is to quantify the changes in instantaneous shortwave albedo produced by biomass burning activities and their associated radiative forcing. The study relies on the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64A1 burned-area product to create an annual composite of areas affected by fire and the MCD43C2 bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) albedo snow-free product to compute a bihemispherical reflectance time series. The approximate day of burning is used to calculate the instantaneous change in shortwave albedo. Using the corresponding National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) monthly mean downward solar radiation flux at the surface, the global radiative forcing associated with fire was computed. The analysis reveals a mean decrease in shortwave albedo of -0.014 (1Ïƒ Combining double low line 0.017), causing a mean positive radiative forcing of 3.99 Wm-2 (1Ïƒ Combining double low line 4.89) over the 2002-20012 time period in areas affected by fire. The greatest drop in mean shortwave albedo change occurs in 2002, which corresponds to the highest total area burned (378 Mha) observed in the same year and produces the highest mean radiative forcing (4.5 Wm-2). Africa is the main contributor in terms of burned area, but forests globally give the highest radiative forcing per unit area and thus give detectable changes in shortwave albedo. The global mean radiative forcing for the whole period studied (âˆ¼0.0275 Wm-2) shows that the contribution of fires to the Earth system is not insignificant. Â© Author(s) 2015.",
Characterising Brazilian biomass burning emissions using WRF-Chem with MOSAIC sectional aerosol,"The South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) field campaign took detailed in situ flight measurements of aerosol during the 2012 dry season to characterise biomass burning aerosol and improve understanding of its impacts on weather and climate. Developments have been made to the Weather Research and Forecast model with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model to improve the representation of biomass burning aerosol in the region, by coupling a sectional aerosol scheme to the plume-rise parameterisation. Brazilian Biomass Burning Emissions Model (3BEM) fire emissions are used, prepared using PREP-CHEM-SRC, and mapped to CBM-Z and MOSAIC species. Model results have been evaluated against remote sensing products, AERONET sites, and four case studies of flight measurements from the SAMBBA campaign. WRF-Chem predicted layers of elevated aerosol loadings (5-20 Î¼g sm-3) of particulate organic matter at high altitude (6-8 km) over tropical forest regions, while flight measurements showed a sharp decrease above 2-4 km altitude. This difference was attributed to the plume-rise parameterisation overestimating injection height. The 3BEM emissions product was modified using estimates of active fire size and burned area for the 2012 fire season, which reduced the fire size. The enhancement factor for fire emissions was increased from 1.3 to 5 to retain reasonable aerosol optical depths (AODs). The smaller fire size lowered the injection height of the emissions, but WRF-Chem still showed elevated aerosol loadings between 4-5 km altitude. Over eastern cerrado (savannah-like) regions, both modelled and measured aerosol loadings decreased above approximately 4 km altitude. Compared with MODIS satellite data and AERONET sites, WRF-Chem represented AOD magnitude well (between 0.3-1.5) over western tropical forest fire regions in the first half of the campaign, but tended to over-predict them in the second half, when precipitation was more significant. Over eastern cerrado regions, WRF-Chem tended to under-predict AODs. Modelled aerosol loadings in the east were higher in the modified emission scenario. The primary organic matter to black carbon ratio was typically between 8-10 in WRF-Chem. This was lower than the western flight measurements (interquartile range of 11.6-15.7 in B734, 14.7-24.0 in B739), but similar to the eastern flight B742 (8.1-10.4). However, single scattering albedo was close to measured over the western flights (0.87-0.89 in model; 0.86-0.91 in flight B734, and 0.81-0.95 in flight B739 measurements) but too high over the eastern flight B742 (0.86-0.87 in model, 0.79-0.82 in measurements). This suggests that improvements are needed to both modelled aerosol composition and optical properties calculations in WRF-Chem. Â© Author(s) 2015.",
Biomass burning emissions contaminate winter snowfalls in urban Beijing: A case study in 2012," Three monosaccharide anhydrides levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan were detected in winter snowfall samples of 2012 in urban Beijing. Concentrations of three isomers vary from 0.15 to 54.43 ng mLâ€“1, with an average value of 10.49 ng mLâ€“1. Levoglucosan is the most abundant component. Winter snowfalls are contaminated by biomass burning emissions seriously in urban Beijing. The main sources are softwood and crop residue burnings around Beijing from late autumn to early winter, while longâ€“range transport of biomass burning emissions contribute more during the late winter. Concentrations of monosaccharide anhydrides in snowfall samples may be affected by both topography and the meteorological conditions around urban Beijing. Â© Author(s) 2015.",
Fire hazard modelling in southern Africa,"In this study, we analyzed fire occurrences in Southern Africa using point pattern analysis methods. The intensity of events varied vary across the region, events interacted across the region. The intensity plot showed that events are more concentrated at latitude -12.00 and longitude 35.00. Ripley's k-function revealed that events are clustered up to a distance of 14 km. We tested hypothesis that Higher amounts of dry mass productivity (DMP) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) result in more fire occurrences and more biomass burning, we also hypothesized that dry woodlands in savannah ecosystems result in more fire occurrences as compared to other land cover types in MaxEnt. Results showed DMP, NDVI and land cover types can be used to model Are occurrences with an ACU of 0,760.It also showed that as DMP and NDVI increased fire occurrence probability also increased. More fires are concentrated (0.79) in crop land with woody vegetation and closed grass land cover types. All the countries in Southern Africa have a high fire risky.",
Central American biomass burning smoke can increase tornado severity in the U.S.,"Tornadoes in the Southeast and central U.S. are episodically accompanied by smoke from biomass burning in central America. Analysis of the 27 April 2011 historical tornado outbreak shows that adding smoke to an environment already conducive to severe thunderstorm development can increase the likelihood of significant tornado occurrence. Numerical experiments indicate that the presence of smoke during this event leads to optical thickening of shallow clouds while soot within the smoke enhances the capping inversion through radiation absorption. The smoke effects are consistent with measurements of clouds and radiation before and during the outbreak. These effects result in lower cloud bases and stronger low-level wind shear in the warm sector of the extratropical cyclone generating the outbreak, two indicators of higher probability of tornadogenesis and tornado intensity and longevity. These mechanisms may contribute to tornado modulation by aerosols, highlighting the need to consider aerosol feedbacks in numerical severe weather forecasting. Â© 2015 The Authors.",
High resolution source-resolved PM2.5 spatial distribution and human exposure in a large urban area,"Chemical transport models often use moderate spatial resolution to simulate atmospheric pollution, thereby limiting the model's ability to represent variations in urban areas. Additionally, the contributions of individual sources of pollution transported to the urban areas of interest from elsewhere are rarely quantified. In this study, we developed an approach to simulate air quality, focusing on PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter lower than 2.5 Î¼m), and its local and regional sources at high spatial resolution of 1 Ã— 1 km2. The approach is applied in the largest city of Greece, Athens. The PMCAMx chemical transport model is employed in combination with the source apportionment algorithm, PSAT (Particle Source Apportionment Technology), to quantify the concentrations and sources of PM2.5, organic aerosol (OA) and elemental carbon (EC) for a typical summer and winter month. A novel approach is developed, allowing the quantification of the contributions of sources not only inside the simulated urban area but also of the regional sources located outside. Model predictions were combined with population distribution data to provide estimations for human exposure not only to total PM2.5 concentrations but also to specific sources within the city. Residential biomass burning and transportation were found to be the dominant local sources of PM2.5 exposure. The higher resolution (1 Ã— 1 km2) offered a more detailed representation of PM2.5 spatial variability than a coarser one (36 Ã— 36 km2). This underscores the importance of capturing local sources in specific areas of the domain. The proposed approach can be used to provide estimates of human exposure to specific local and regional sources of primary and secondary PM2.5 in an urban area. Â© 2025 The Authors",
Application of triple-branch artificial neural network system for catalytic pellets combustion,"On the international level, it is common to act on reducing emissions from energy systems. However, in addition to industrial emissions, low-stack emissions also make a significant contribution. A good step in reducing its environmental impact, is to move to biofuels, including biomass. This paper examines the impact of placing a catalytic system in a retort boiler to minimize emissions of greenhouse gases, dust and other pollutants when burning pellets. The effect of platinum, and oxides of selected metals placed on the deflector as a solid catalyst was studied. Based on the experimental data, a branched artificial neural network was constructed and trained. The routing of three parallel topologies made it possible to achieve high accuracy while keeping the input data relatively simple. The system showed an average error of 3.54% against arbitrary test data. On the basis of experimental data as well as predictions returned by the artificial neural network, recommendations were shown for the catalysts used and their amounts. Depending on the biomass from which the pellet was produced, the experiment suggested the use of titanium or copper oxides. In the case of the neural network, it was able to select a better system, based on platinum, improving emission reductions by up to more than 19%, depending on the type of pellet used.

Exploring the association between long-term MODIS aerosol and air pollutants data across the Northern Great Plains through machine learning analysis,"Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (AE) are the major environmental indicators to perceive air quality and the impact of aerosol on climate change and health as well as the global atmospheric conditions. In the present study, an average of AOD and AE data from Tera and Aqua satellites of MODIS sensors has been investigated over 7 years i.e., from 2016 to 2022, at four locations over Northern Great Plains. Both temporal and seasonal variations over the study periods have been investigated to understand the behavior of AOD and AE. Over the years, the highest AOD and AE were observed in winter season, varying from 0.75 to 1.17 and 1.30 to 1.63, respectively. During pre-monsoon season, increasing trend of AOD varying from 0.65 to 0.95 was observed from upper (New Delhi) to lower (Kolkata) Gangetic plain, however, during monsoon and post-monsoon a reverse trend varying from 0.85 to 0.65 has been observed. Seasonal and temporal aerosol characteristics have also been analyzed and it has been assessed that biomass burning was found to be the major contributor, followed by desert dust at all the locations except in Lucknow, where the second largest contributor was dust instead of desert dust. During season-wise analysis, biomass burning was also found to be as the major contributor at all the places in all the seasons except New Delhi and Lucknow, where dust was the major contributor during pre-monsoon. A boosting regression algorithm was done using machine learning to explore the relative influence of different atmospheric parameters and pollutants with PM2.5. Water vapor was assessed to have the maximum relative influence i.e., 51.66 % followed by CO (21.81 %). This study aims to help policy makers and decision makers better understand the correlation between different atmospheric components and pollutants and the contribution of different types of aerosols.

Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) UV aerosol index data analysis over the Arctic region for future data assimilation and climate forcing applications,"Due to a lack of high-latitude ground-based and satellite-based data from traditional passive- and active-based measurements, the impact of aerosol particles on the Arctic region is one of the least understood factors contributing to recent Arctic sea ice changes. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using the ultraviolet (UV) aerosol index (AI) parameter from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), a semi-quantitative aerosol parameter, for quantifying spatiotemporal changes in UV-absorbing aerosols over the Arctic region. We found that OMI AI data are affected by an additional row anomaly that is unflagged by the OMI quality control flag and are systematically biased as functions of observing conditions, such as azimuth angle, and certain surface types over the Arctic region, resulting in an anomalous ""ring""of climatologically high AI centered at about 70Â°N, surrounding an area of low AI over the pole. Two methods were developed in this study for quality-assuring the Arctic AI data. Using quality-controlled OMI AI data from 2005 through 2020, we found decreases in UV-absorbing aerosols in the spring months (April and May) over much of the Arctic region and increases in UV-absorbing aerosols in the summer months (June, July, and August) over northern Russia and northern Canada. Additionally, we found significant increases in the frequency and size of UV-absorbing aerosol events across the Arctic and high-Arctic (north of 80Â°N) regions for the latter half of the study period (2014-2020), driven primarily by a significant increase in boreal biomass-burning plume coverage.

Impact of Biomass Burning Organic Aerosol Volatility on Smoke Concentrations Downwind of Fires,"Biomass burning particulate matter (BBPM) affects regional air quality and global climate, with impacts expected to continue to grow over the coming years. We show that studies of North American fires have a systematic altitude dependence in measured BBPM normalized excess mixing ratio (NEMR; Î”PM/Î”CO), with airborne and high-altitude studies showing a factor of 2 higher NEMR than ground-based measurements. We report direct airborne measurements of BBPM volatility that partially explain the difference in the BBPM NEMR observed across platforms. We find that when heated to 40-45 Â°C in an airborne thermal denuder, 19% of lofted smoke PM1 evaporates. Thermal denuder measurements are consistent with evaporation observed when a single smoke plume was sampled across a range of temperatures as the plume descended from 4 to 2 km altitude. We also demonstrate that chemical aging of smoke and differences in PM emission factors can not fully explain the platform-dependent differences. When the measured PM volatility is applied to output from the High Resolution Rapid Refresh Smoke regional model, we predict a lower PM NEMR at the surface compared to the lofted smoke measured by aircraft. These results emphasize the significant role that gas-particle partitioning plays in determining the air quality impacts of wildfire smoke. Â© 2023 American Chemical Society.",
Optimizing biogas production: a novel hybrid approach using anaerobic digestion calculator and machine learning techniques on Indian biogas plant,"In low- and middle-income countries, managing municipal solid waste and crop residue burning is a major environmental and public health challenge. Composting and anaerobic digestion technologies are promising solutions for biodegradable organic waste management, particularly in India. However, accurate estimation of biogas yield and economic viability is essential for successful implementation of anaerobic digestion in Indian municipalities, considering regional climatic conditions like psychrophilic and psychotropic climates found in areas like North-east India. The proposed anaerobic digestion calculator provides valuable insights for operators to optimize anaerobic digestion unit performance, monitor seasonal variations in biogas production, and enhance profitability under diverse climatic conditions. It comprises a robust biogas production model and an economic model for revenue and cost evaluation. The calculator caters to the needs of anaerobic digestion units commonly employed in India, considering location-specific factors like energy prices, product values, and government incentives. The predictive models developed using machine learning techniques, including multilayer perceptron, support vector regression, and hybrid models like autoregressive integrated moving average-multilayer perceptron, enable the optimization of biogas production by adjusting key parameters. In summary, the proposed anaerobic digestion calculator and machine learning-based predictive models offer a comprehensive approach for biogas yield estimation, optimization, and economic analysis. This contributes to the efficient, sustainable, and profitable operation of biogas plants, supporting India's transition towards a bio-based smart economy and addressing environmental and public health concerns associated with waste management.

Modeling Historical and Future Forest Fires in South Korea: The FLAM Optimization Approach,"Climate change-induced heat waves increase the global risk of forest fires, intensifying biomass burning and accelerating climate change in a vicious cycle. This presents a challenge to the response system in heavily forested South Korea, increasing the risk of more frequent and large-scale fire outbreaks. This study aims to optimize IIASAâ€™s wildFire cLimate impacts and Adaptation Model (FLAM)â€”a processed-based model integrating biophysical and human impactsâ€”to South Korea for projecting the pattern and scale of future forest fires. The developments performed in this study include: (1) the optimization of probability algorithms in FLAM based on the national GIS data downscaled to 1 km2 with additional factors introduced for national specific modeling; (2) the improvement of soil moisture computation by adjusting the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) to represent vegetation feedbacks by fitting soil moisture to daily remote sensing data; and (3) projection of future forest fire frequency and burned area. Our results show that optimization has considerably improved the modeling of seasonal patterns of forest fire frequency. Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient between monthly predictions and observations from national statistics over 2016â€“2022 was improved from 0.171 in the non-optimized to 0.893 in the optimized FLAM. These findings imply that FLAMâ€™s main algorithms for interpreting biophysical and human impacts on forest fire at a global scale are only applicable to South Korea after the optimization of all modules, and climate change is the main driver of the recent increases in forest fires. Projections for forest fire were produced for four periods until 2100 based on the forest management plan, which included three management scenarios (current, ideal, and overprotection). Ideal management led to a reduction of 60â€“70% of both fire frequency and burned area compared to the overprotection scenario. This study should be followed by research for developing adaptation strategies corresponding to the projected risks of future forest fires. Â© 2023 by the authors.",
Evaluation of MODIS Dark Target AOD Product with 3 and 10 km Resolution in Amazonia,"The techniques and analyses employed by remote sensing provide key information about atmospheric particle properties at regional and global scales. However, limitations in optical spectral models used to represent the different types of aerosols in the atmosphere and their effects (direct and indirect) are still one of the major causes of sources of uncertainties and substantial impacts in climate prediction. There are no studies yet in South America, especially in the Amazon Basin, that have evaluated the advantages, disadvantages, inconsistencies, applicability, and suitability of the MODIS sensor (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) destined for monitoring the ambient aerosol optical thickness over rivers and continents. In this study, the results of the DT (Dark Target) algorithm for products with 3 km and 10 km resolutions were systematically evaluated for six sites in the Amazon rainforest. The comparisons between the products were carried out with the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) measurements, which were used as reference. Statistical parameters between AERONET vs. MODIS were also evaluated based on biomass burning records in the site regions. Here, the DT 10 km product showed satisfactory performance for the Amazon region, with observations between the expected error (EE) limits above 66%, in addition to R > 0.8 and RMSE < 0.3. However, the regional analysis for the two sites in the central and southern regions of the Amazon basin did not have the same performance, where the results showed an EE of 24 and 47%, respectively. The DT 3 km product did not perform well in any site, with an EE below 50%. Both products overestimated the AOD, but the 3 km product overestimated it approximately four times more due to its algorithm setup. Thus, we recommend the 10 km product for general analysis in Amazonia. Regional biomass burning records showed a direct relationship with the AERONET vs. MODIS DT with overestimation of both products. All variations between products and sites were justified based on the difficulty of retrieving surface reflectance and the model selected for local aerosols. Improvements in the optical spectral model currently implemented in the algorithms, with more realistic representations of the main types of the aerosol present in the Amazon Basin, may contribute to better performance among the evaluated products.

Spatio-Temporal Monitoring of Atmospheric Pollutants Using Earth Observation Sentinel 5P TROPOMI Data: Impact of Stubble Burning a Case Study,"The problems of atmospheric pollutants are causing significant concern across the globe and in India. The aggravated level of atmospheric pollutants in the surrounding environment poses serious threats to normal living conditions by deteriorating air quality and causing adverse health impacts. Pollutant concentration increases during harvesting seasons of Kharif/Rabi due to stubble burning and is aggravated by other points or mobile sources. The present study is intended to monitor the spatio-temporal variation of the major atmospheric pollutants using Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data through cloud computing. Land Use/Land Cover (LULC-categorization or classification of human activities and natural coverage on the landscape) was utilised to extract the agricultural area in the study site. It involves the cloud computing of MOD64A1 (MODIS Burned monthly gridded data) and Sentinel-5P TROPOMI (S5P Tropomi) data for major atmospheric pollutants, such as CH4, NO2, SOx, CO, aerosol, and HCHO. The burned area output provided information regarding the stubble burning period, which has seen post-harvesting agricultural residue burning after Kharif crop harvesting (i.e., rice from April to June) and Rabi crop harvesting (i.e., wheat from September to November). The long duration of stubble burning is due to variation in farmers' harvesting and burning stubble/biomass remains in the field for successive crops. This period was used as criteria for considering the cloud computing of the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data for atmospheric pollutants concentration in the study site. The results showed a significant increase in CH4, SO2, SOx, CO, and aerosol concentration during the AMJ months (stubble burning of Rabi crops) and OND months (stubble burning of Kharif crops) of each year. The results are validated with the ground control station data for PM2.5/PM10. and patterns of precipitation and temperature-gridded datasets. The trajectory frequency for air mass movement using the HYSPLIT model showed that the highest frequency and concentration were observed during OND months, followed by the AMJ months of each year (2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021). This study supports the role and robustness of Earth observation Sentinel-5P TROPOMI to monitor and evaluate air quality and pollutants distribution. Â© 2022 by the authors.",
A weather regime characterisation of winter biomass aerosol transport from southern Africa,"During austral winter, a compact low cloud deck over the South Atlantic contrasts with clear sky over southern Africa, where forest fires triggered by dry conditions emit large amounts of biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) in the free troposphere. Most of the BBA burden crosses the South Atlantic embedded in the tropical easterly flow. However, midlatitude synoptic disturbances can deflect part of the aerosol from the main transport path towards southern extratropics. In this study, the first objective classification of the synoptic variability controlling the spatial distribution of BBA in southern Africa and the South Atlantic during austral winter (August to October) is presented. By analysing atmospheric circulation data from reanalysis products, a six-class weather regime (WR) classification of the region is constructed. The classification reveals that the synoptic variability is composed of four WRs, representing disturbances travelling at midlatitudes, and two WRs accounting for pressure anomalies in the South Atlantic. The WR classification is then successfully used to characterise the aerosol spatial distribution in the region in the period 2003-2017, in both reanalysis products and station data. Results show that the BBA transport towards southern extratropics is controlled by weather regimes associated with midlatitude synoptic disturbances. In particular, depending on the relative position of the pressure anomalies along the midlatitude westerly flow, the BBA transport is deflected from the main tropical route towards southern Africa or the South Atlantic. Moreover, the WRs accounting for midlatitude disturbances show organised transition sequences, which allow one to illustrate the evolution of the BBA northerly transport across the region in the context of a wave pattern. The skill in characterising the BBA transport shown by the WR classification indicates the potential for using it as a diagnostic/predictive tool for the aerosol dynamics, which is a key component for the full understanding and modelling of the complex radiation-aerosol-cloud interactions controlling the atmospheric radiative budget in the region.

"Land use regression modeling for fine particulate matters in Bangkok, Thailand, using time-variant predictors: Effects of seasonal factors, open biomass burning, and traffic-related factors","In recent years, as the level of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration has become more closely monitored in Thailand and its harmful effects on health have been widely recognized by the public, the Thai government has debated various measures to improve air quality. In this paper, the Land Use Regression (LUR) technique was used to model the relationship between the daily PM2.5 concentration and various predictor variables using data from the entire year of 2019. The results confirmed strong seasonal effects on PM2.5 and substantial effects of time-variant predictors, including open biomass burning and meteorological conditions. However, time-invariant variables, including traffic, transportation, and land use characteristics were generally weaker predictors in the LUR models. The results of the model based on data for the entire year showed better statistical fit and robustness than the seasonal models. The relatively low adjusted R2 of the models developed in this study compared with previous LUR studies suggests that more detailed data, especially the traffic volume on roads nearby monitoring sites, might be necessary to improve the model's performance. Finally, the large buffer size of the open biomass burning predictor implied that the measures to reduce PM2.5 by limiting open biomass burning would require international cooperation as some fires within the buffer area occurred in neighboring countries outside the borders of Thailand.

Investigating diesel engines as an atmospheric source of isocyanic acid in urban areas,"Isocyanic acid (HNCO), an acidic gas found in tobacco smoke, urban environments, and biomass-burning-affected regions, has been linked to adverse health outcomes. Gasoline- and diesel-powered engines and biomass burning are known to emit HNCO and hypothesized to emit precursors such as amides that can photochemically react to produce HNCO in the atmosphere. Increasingly, diesel engines in developed countries like the United States are required to use selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to reduce tailpipe emissions of oxides of nitrogen. SCR chemistry is known to produce HNCO as an intermediate product, and SCR systems have been implicated as an atmospheric source of HNCO. In this work, we measure HNCO emissions from an SCR system-equipped diesel engine and, in combination with earlier data, use a three-dimensional chemical transport model (CTM) to simulate the ambient concentrations and source/pathway contributions to HNCO in an urban environment. Engine tests were conducted at three different engine loads, using two different fuels and at multiple operating points. HNCO was measured using an acetate chemical ionization mass spectrometer. The diesel engine was found to emit primary HNCO (3-90mg-1) but we did not find any evidence that the SCR system or other aftertreatment devices (i.e., oxidation catalyst and particle filter) produced or enhanced HNCO emissions. The CTM predictions compared well with the only available observational datasets for HNCO in urban areas but underpredicted the contribution from secondary processes. The comparison implied that diesel-powered engines were the largest source of HNCO in urban areas. The CTM also predicted that daily-averaged concentrations of HNCO reached a maximum of 110pptv but were an order of magnitude lower than the 1ppbv level that could be associated with physiological effects in humans. Precursor contributions from other combustion sources (gasoline and biomass burning) and wintertime conditions could enhance HNCO concentrations but need to be explored in future work.

Source contributions and regional transport of primary particulate matter in China,"A source-oriented CMAQ was applied to determine source sector/region contributions to primary particulate matter (PPM) in China. Four months were simulated with emissions grouped to eight regions and six sectors. Predicted elemental carbon (EC), primary organic carbon (POC), and PPM concentrations and source contributions agree with measurements and have significant spatiotemporal variations. Residential is a major contributor to spring/winter EC (50-80%), POC (60%-90%), and PPM (30-70%). For summer/fall, industrial contributes 30-50% for EC/POC and 40-60% for PPM. Transportation is more important for EC (20-30%) than POC/PPM (<5%). Open burning is important in summer/fall of Guangzhou and Chongqing. Dust contributes to 1/3-1/2 in spring/fall of Beijing, Xi'an and Chongqing. Based on sector-region combination, local residential/transportation and residential/industrial from Heibei are major contributors to spring PPM in Beijing. In summer/fall, local industrial is the largest. In winter, residential/industrial from local and Hebei account for >90% in Beijing. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",
Multi-sensor cloud and aerosol retrieval simulator and remote sensing from model parameters-Part 2: Aerosols,"The Multi-sensor Cloud Retrieval Simulator (MCRS) produces a ""simulated radiance"" product from any high-resolution general circulation model with interactive aerosol as if a specific sensor such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were viewing a combination of the atmospheric column and land-ocean surface at a specific location. Previously the MCRS code only included contributions from atmosphere and clouds in its radiance calculations and did not incorporate properties of aerosols. In this paper we added a new aerosol properties module to the MCRS code that allows users to insert a mixture of up to 15 different aerosol species in any of 36 vertical layers.This new MCRS code is now known as MCARS (Multi-sensor Cloud and Aerosol Retrieval Simulator). Inclusion of an aerosol module into MCARS not only allows for extensive, tightly controlled testing of various aspects of satellite operational cloud and aerosol properties retrieval algorithms, but also provides a platform for comparing cloud and aerosol models against satellite measurements. This kind of two-way platform can improve the efficacy of model parameterizations of measured satellite radiances, allowing the assessment of model skill consistently with the retrieval algorithm. The MCARS code provides dynamic controls for appearance of cloud and aerosol layers. Thereby detailed quantitative studies of the impacts of various atmospheric components can be controlled.In this paper we illustrate the operation of MCARS by deriving simulated radiances from various data field output by the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) model. The model aerosol fields are prepared for translation to simulated radiance using the same model subgrid variability parameterizations as are used for cloud and atmospheric properties profiles, namely the ICA technique. After MCARS computes modeled sensor radiances equivalent to their observed counterparts, these radiances are presented as input to operational remote-sensing algorithms.Specifically, the MCARS-computed radiances are input into the processing chain used to produce the MODIS Data Collection 6 aerosol product (M{O/Y}D04). The M{O/Y}D04 product is of course normally produced from M{O/Y}D021KM MODIS Level-1B radiance product directly acquired by the MODIS instrument. MCARS matches the format and metadata of a M{O/Y}D021KM product. The resulting MCARS output can be directly provided to MODAPS (MODIS Adaptive Processing System) as input to various operational atmospheric retrieval algorithms. Thus the operational algorithms can be tested directly without needing to make any software changes to accommodate an alternative input source.We show direct application of this synthetic product in analysis of the performance of the MOD04 operational algorithm. We use biomass-burning case studies over Amazonia employed in a recent Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE)-sponsored study of aerosol impacts on numerical weather prediction (Freitas et al., 2015). We demonstrate that a known low bias in retrieved MODIS aerosol optical depth appears to be due to a disconnect between actual column relative humidity and the value assumed by the MODIS aerosol product.

Near-source dispersion and coagulation parameterization: Application to biomass burning emissions,"Aerosol size distributions near biomass-burning sources undergo rapid evolution, primarily due to coagulation, which significantly alters the particle number size distribution. Existing long-range aerosol transport and climate prediction models often overlook near-source dynamics involving simultaneous coagulation and dispersion. To bridge this gap, the present study introduces a coagulation-dispersion model and provides semi-analytical solutions for the effective size distribution parameters. The precise solution for a diffusion-less coagulating plume with spatially varying particle concentration supports the conceptual accuracy of the semi-analytical parameterization for dispersion-coagulation model. These solutions form the basis for a parameterization scheme that considers input parameters such as source dimensions, particle mass flux, particle size, and atmospheric conditions. Utilizing this parameterization for case-specific biomass burning emissions shows a decrease in number emission rate by approximately a factor of 600, while the count median diameter of the initial size distribution increases by around 7 times. Additionally, we estimate the optical properties of aerosols both before and after the introduction of the near-source parameterization scheme. Results indicate an increase by a factor of 4 in the aerosol extinction coefficient and by a factor of âˆ¼20 in the scattering coefficient, which will significantly influence the calculation of aerosol optical properties in global models. These changes in optical properties primarily stem from modifications in aerosol size distribution resulting from near-source aerosol dynamics. The results are further discussed.

Study on global atmospheric aerosol type identification from combined satellite and ground observations,"Accurate identification of aerosol types is essential for understanding the radiative properties of aerosols and further studying aerosol regional and global climate effects. However, aerosol type identification studies combining satellite and ground observations are rare. In this paper, an aerosol type identification model based on aerosol relative optical depth (AROD) and volume depolarization ratio (VDR) is developed by effectively matching satellite and ground observation data. The accuracy and applicability of the new model are verified by typical AERONET sites with dominant aerosols, and the spatial distribution characteristics of aerosol types in global continents are also studied and analyzed with joint observation data from 2018 to 2023 globally. The results show that the East Asian continent, North America, and Europe are the main source regions for continental aerosol emissions. Among the continents, densely populated East/Southeast Asia is more heavily polluted by anthropogenic aerosols than other continents, while North America and Europe are relatively less polluted. The Indo-China Peninsula, central and southern Africa, central South America, and central and northern North America are the main source emission regions of global biomass burning aerosol, while northern Africa, West Asia, and Central Asia emit most of the global dust and polluted dust aerosols. Additionally, marine aerosols are more frequent along the east coast of North America, the west coast of Africa, the Malay Archipelago, and some island sites. The present study provides a basis for aerosol type identification using joint observation data and effectively promotes research in related fields. Â© 2025 Elsevier Ltd",
Critical review of air pollution contribution in Delhi due to paddy stubble burning in North Indian States,"The application of diverse methods/tools (satellite data, ground-based monitoring and dispersion modelling) for quantitative assessment of air pollution has created a critical challenge for policymakers, in understating the actual stubble burning contribution in North Indian states including Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh. Considering the variations in monitoring sites, quantified emissions, satellite data resolutions, parameterization schemes, meteorology and/or adopted models, huge differences in the source contribution are reported. Considering these ambiguities, the present study is an attempt to review the studies revealing actual paddy stubble burning contribution to air quality of Delhi conducted year 2015 onwards; one year before the severe episodic smog event of November 2016. A total of 114 articles were searched using different keywords for subsequent in-depth analysis. The biomass burning share was broadly studied for winter, summer and post-monsoon seasons. Further, to understand the season-specific nature of the paddy stubble burning activity, the analysis was restricted to post-monsoon months. A co-occurrence keyword network analysis was performed based on which biomass/stubble burning related studies were divided into three clusters based on i) source apportionment using receptor modeling, ii) satellite data (AOD values coupled with ground-based observation and wind back trajectory and, iii) regional scale chemical transport modeling approach. Some studies were generalized displaying correlation patterns, some used only fire count data and correlated with AOD while some used either satellite data or regional scale models. Learning from the gap analysis of the reviewed studies led to the development of an integrated assessment protocol to quantify the stubble-burning contribution in the region. Â© 2025 Elsevier Ltd",
Modeling the impacts of open biomass burning on regional O3 and PM2.5 in Southeast Asia considering light absorption and photochemical bleaching of Brown carbon,"Open biomass burning in Southeast Asia has significant adverse impacts on air quality in the region and in downwind areas. These biomass burning events emit large amounts of light absorbing brown carbon (BrC). Once in the atmosphere, the light absorbing capacity of BrC is reduced by various oxidation processes. However, few modeling studies have been conducted to explicitly examine light absorption and bleaching on the prediction of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In this study, a modified Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model that explicitly tracks the concentrations of light absorbing and non-light absorbing organic aerosol components from different emission sources and the bleaching of BrC due to photooxidation and OH oxidation is applied to widespread open biomass burning events in March 2018 in Southeast Asia. Open biomass burning accounts for as much as 20â€“40 ppb (30â€“50%) of the maximum daily average 8-h ozone (MDA8 O3) and 40â€“120 Î¼g mâˆ’3 (60â€“90%) of the daily average PM2.5 in the emission source regions. Compared to a simulation without BrC light absorption, the predicted MDA8 O3 and PM2.5 are as much as 16 ppb and 16 Î¼g mâˆ’3 lower, respectively, than a simulation with light absorption. This confirms that neglecting the UV light absorption of BrC can lead to significant overpredictions of O3 and PM2.5 during the open biomass burning periods, which may lead to an overestimation of the adverse impacts of biomass burning on public health in Southeast Asia. The addition of BrC bleaching results in a 0.5â€“1% increase in MDA8 O3 and 1â€“5% increase in PM2.5 compared to the case without BrC bleaching. The results of this study indicate that light absorption by BrC needs to be considered in chemical transport modeling of large open biomass burning events. The BrC bleaching process is relatively slow and neglecting this process does not significantly change the predictions of MDA8 O3 and PM2.5 during open biomass burning. Â© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",
Analysis of Aerosol Optical Mixing Using the EOMOS Model From Typical AERONET Sites,"Satellite remote sensing predominantly employs optical properties for aerosol classification, often neglecting aerosol mixing and lacking validation accuracy. This study defines five aerosol types: marine, continental, dust, urban-industrial, and biomass-burning. Proposing the external optical mixing optimization solver (EOMOS) model based on the external mixing assumption, the model's accuracy is enhanced by approximately 95.0% through constraints and optimization. Perturbation experiments on particle size distribution and complex refractive index validate the model's robustness. The EOMOS model analyzes aerosol mixing states, and quantifies contributions to aerosol optical depth (AOD) for each aerosol type, surpassing traditional methods by at least 139.7%. Additionally, the EOMOS model examines trends in aerosol type AOD, revealing a noticeable post-2013 reduction in AOD of urban-industrial aerosols in Beijing, suggesting pollution mitigation. In Brazil, urban-industrial and biomass-burning aerosol AODs were 328.1% and 107.7% higher in 2005, 2007, and 2010, primarily due to fire impact. Â© 2024. The Author(s).",
Source-specific health effects of internally exposed organics in urban PM2.5 based on human serum albumin adductome analysis,"Once inhaled, organic compounds in ambient PM2.5 permeate the bloodstream, resulting in internal exposure. The intricate composition of these internalized organic molecules complicates the processes of source attribution and toxicity assessment. A systematic framework to assess the health impacts of water-soluble organic molecules (WSOMs) originating from diverse sources is still undeveloped. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the source-specific health effects of internalized organics in urban PM2.5 through human serum albumin (HSA) non-covalent adductomes with WSOMs. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and machine learning, we mapped HSA-WSOM interactions, uncovering WSOM's potential internal exposure through its HSA adductome. The study identified eight distinct sources of internalized WSOMs, primarily from biogenic emissions, gasoline exhaust, and biomass combustion. Notably, WSOMs from these sources exhibited a predominant interaction with HSA residues ARG257, LEU238, and TRP150, substantially altering the functional dynamics of fatty acid binding site two and the hydrophobic cavity via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The primary health impacts of internalized WSOMs were identified as neurotoxicity and respiratory toxicity. WSOMs originating from biogenic sources and ocean emissions were mainly responsible for neurotoxic effects, whereas those from biomass burning and gasoline exhaust predominantly caused respiratory toxicity. Using the HSA adductome framework, our study identifies source-specific profiles and health effects of internally exposed WSOMs in urban PM2.5, emphasizing the importance of targeted mitigation strategies.

Spatiotemporal Variability and Source Apportionment of Particulate Matter (PM) Emissions Using Binned Size Distributions: Insights from MERRA-2 Over Africa,"Particulate matter (PM) plays a crucial role in atmospheric processes, significantly impacting air quality, climate, and human health across Africa. The present study identified five distinct regions: Western, Northern, Central, Eastern and Southern Africa, each exhibiting unique PM bin characteristics and sources. This study employed the multispectral data from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) to characterize and apportion PM sources across the continent in five bins; Bin1 to Bin5. While, AERONET sun-photometry served as a validation tool at 440Â nm, 500Â nm and 675Â nm, offering high-quality ground-based measurements. The validation of MERRA-2 model AOD data with ground-based AERONET measurements showed low, moderate and strong correlation coefficients, indicating reliable data for regional PM analysis. Further, on source apportionment, analysis identifies major PM sources, including Sahara dust, biomass burning, and urban pollution (0.0024), highlighting the implications of air pollution on human health. Notably, the Bodele Depression in Chad emerged as a dominant dust emission hotspot, contributing significantly to transboundary dust transport. The contributions of each PM dust bin over the five African regions followed a similar pattern with posting approximately 50% over all regions. However, the PM matter was noted to be high over the Northern and Western regions of Africa attributed to Sahara desert where dust storms are dominant. Basing on the findings, there is urgent need to integrate advanced data technologies into future atmospheric and environmental studies by adopting high resolution multispectral and hyper spectral remote sensing and machine learning-driven source apportionment. An effective air quality management policies should focus on mitigating dust emissions in high-risk areas such as Northern Africa and the Sahel Also, there is need to strengthen observational networks across Africa especially in regions with complex aerosol interactions that are critical in refining air quality management strategies.

Assessing ozone formation impact through SHAP interaction redistribution analysis: A novel framework for evaluating VOC photochemical loss and source interactions,"Despite extensive research on tropospheric ozone (O3) formation, quantifying the impact of photochemical processes on source contributions remains challenging. This study developed a SHAP interaction redistribution analysis (SIRA) framework that systematically analyzes and reallocates machine learning interpretation results to quantify photochemical impacts on O3 formation and source contributions. Based on improved photochemical age parameterization method, the mean VOC photochemical loss concentration was 7.44 Â± 10.36 ppb, with alkenes, aromatics, and OVOCs showing the highest ratios of photochemical loss to observed concentrations (1.35, 0.90, and 0.66, respectively). SHAP analysis revealed meteorological factors and NO as primary contributors to O3 formation (50.82 % and 12.24 %, respectively). The importance ratio of TVOCs to NOx was 1.5 during the study period and increased to 2.4 during O3 pollution episodes, indicating VOC-limited O3 formation with enhanced VOC sensitivity during pollution periods. The SIRA framework identified secondary generation (48.38 %), biogenic emissions (13.87 %), and industrial emissions (9.33 %) as major O3 contributors under photochemical loss conditions. After redistributing secondary generation through source interaction analysis, biogenic emissions and biomass burning showed the highest increases in SHAP importance (41.18 % with mean |SHAP values| = 1.87 and 40.27 % with mean |SHAP values| = 0.98, respectively), identifying them as the primary precursor sources for secondary generation. Among anthropogenic sources, vehicle emissions became the dominant contributor with a 17.0 % increase in contribution. This framework offers an innovative approach for quantifying the photochemical impacts on source contributions, enabling more targeted and effective strategies for O3 pollution control.

How air pollution affects cause-specific emergency hospital admissions on days with biomass combustion in Spain?,"Although wildfires are growing in number, intensity and extent due to climate change, few studies have been undertaken to analyse their health impact, and fewer still to analyse the impact of variables other than particulate matter. The objective of this study is to analyse the short-term impact of NO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3 and temperature in heat waves on emergency hospital admissions in Spain on days when biomass combustion occurs. We conducted an ecological longitudinal time series study across the period 2013â€“2018. The dependent variables were emergency hospital admissions due to all causes (ICD-10: A00-R99), circulatory causes (ICD-10: I00-I99) and respiratory causes (ICD-10: J00-J99) in 9 representative Spanish provinces. The independent variables were daily mean air pollution concentrations measured at a provincial level. We also included daily maximum temperatures recorded at reference observatories in the respective provinces. Poisson generalised linear models were fitted for days with and without PM advections due to biomass burning smoke. We controlled for trends, seasonalities, the autoregressive nature of the series, Sundays and Public Holidays. Days with biomass burning smoke advections increased PM concentrations in all provinces and ozone in many of them, something that did not occur in equal measure in the case of NO2. Nevertheless, the principal impact on admissions was due to O3, followed by NO2, PM, and lastly, heat-wave temperatures. This pattern was observed for all three causes analysed. The role of PM was relegated to that of a third factor, and the role of temperature to an order of lesser magnitude than that of chemical pollution. To focus the health impacts of wildfires exclusively on the impact of PM concentrations would be to minimise their real impact on population health. It is therefore essential to implement integrated plans that take into account the joint effect of all atmospheric variables affected. Â© 2025 Elsevier B.V.",
A satellite-based analysis of semi-direct effects of biomass burning aerosols on fog and low-cloud dissipation in the Namib Desert,"In the Namib Desert, fog is the only regular water input and, thus, is a crucial water source for its fauna and flora. Each year, between June and October, absorbing biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) overlie the stratocumulus clouds in the adjacent Southeast Atlantic. In some synoptic settings, this layer of BBAs reaches Namibia and its desert, where it interacts with coastal fog and low clouds (FLCs). In this study, a novel 15-year data set of geostationary satellite observations of FLC dissipation time in the Namib Desert is used, along with reanalysis data, to better understand the potential semi-direct effects of BBAs on FLC dissipation in the Namib Desert, i.e., through adjustments of atmospheric stability and thermodynamics via the interaction of aerosols with radiation. This is done by investigating both the time of day when FLCs dissolve and the synoptic-scale meteorology depending on BBA loading. It is found that FLC dissipation time is significantly later on high-BBA-loading days. BBAs are transported to the Namib along moist free-tropospheric air by a large-scale anticyclonic recirculation pattern. At the surface, the associated longwave heating strengthens a continental heat low, which modifies the circulation and boundary layer moisture along the coastline, complicating the attribution of BBA effects. During high-BBA days, the vertical profiles of the temporal development of air temperatures highlight contrasting daytime and nighttime processes modifying the local inversion. These processes are thought to be driven by greenhouse warming as a result of the moisture in the BBA plumes and BBA absorption (only during the daytime). A statistical learning framework is used to quantify meteorological and BBA influences on FLC dissipation time. The statistical model is able to reproduce the observed differences in FLC dissipation time between high- and low-BBA days and attributes these differences mainly to differences in circulation, boundary layer moisture and near-surface air temperature along the coastline. However, the model is prone to underfitting and is not able to reproduce the majority of the FLC dissipation variability. While the model does not suggest that BBA patterns are important for FLC dissipation, the findings show how the moist BBA plumes modify local thermodynamics, to which FLC dissipation is shown to be sensitive. The findings highlight the challenges of disentangling meteorological and aerosol effects on cloud development using observations and invite detailed modeling analyses of the underlying processes, for example, with large-eddy simulations.

"The Fungal and Protist Community as Affected by Tillage, Crop Residue Burning and N Fertilizer Application","The bacterial community in soil is often affected by agricultural practices, but how they affect protists and fungi is less documented. Soil from treatments that combined different N fertilizer application rates, tillage and crop residue management was sampled from a field trial started by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) at the â€˜Campo Experimental Norman E. Borlaugâ€™ (CENEB) in the Yaqui Valley in the northwest of Mexico in the early 1990s, and the fungal and protist community determined. Tillage, residue burning, and N fertilizer application had no significant effect on the fungal and protists alpha diversity expressed as Hill numbers and no significant effect on the fungal and protist community structure considering all species. The relative abundance of plant pathogens and undefined saprotrophs as determined with FUNGuildR increased significantly with tillage, while that of dung-plant and dung-soil saprotroph, and plant pathogens by burning (P < 0.05). It was found that the protists and fungal community structures were not altered by different agricultural practices, but some fungal guilds were, i.e., plant pathogens and saprotrophs, which might affect soil organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling and crop growth.

Revisiting the high tropospheric ozone over southern Africa: role of biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions,"Tropospheric ozone over southern Africa is particularly high and causes tremendous health risks and crop yield losses. It has been previously attributed to the influence by biomass burning (BB), with a neglected contribution from anthropogenic emissions. However, due to the lack of measurements for ozone and its precursors, the modeled impacts of BB and anthropogenic emissions on tropospheric ozone levels in southern Africa were not well evaluated. In this study, we combined the nested GEOS-Chem simulation with a horizontal resolution of 0.5Â°Ã—0.625Â° with available multiple observations at the surface and from space to quantify tropospheric ozone and its main drivers in southern Africa. Firstly, BB emissions from current different inventories exhibit similar peaks in the summer season but also have large uncertainties in southern Africa (e.g., uncertainty of a factor of 2-3 in emitted NOx). The model-satellite comparison in the fire season (July-August) in 2019 shows that using the widely used Global Fire Emissions Database version 4.1 (GFED4.1) inventory, the model tends to overestimate by 87 % compared to OMI NO2, while the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED2) inventory can greatly reduce this model bias to only 34 %. Consequently, the modeled tropospheric column ozone (TCO) bias was reduced from 14 % by GFED4.1 to 2.3 % by QFED2. In addition, the QFED2 also has a much better spatial representativeness than GFED4.1. The simulated surface daily maximum 8 h mean (MDA8) ozone was decreased from 74 ppb by GFED4.1 to only 56 ppb by QFED2. This suggests a highly overestimated role of BB emissions in surface ozone if GFED4.1 is adopted. The model-observation comparison at the surface shows that the global Community Emissions Data System (CEDSv2) anthropogenic inventory tends to underestimate anthropogenic NOx emissions in typical southern African cities and likely misrepresented anthropogenic sources in some areas. That means that urban ozone and PM2.5 concentrations in southern Africa may be strongly underestimated. For example, a 10-fold increase in anthropogenic NOx emissions can change the ozone chemistry regime and increase PM2.5 by up to 50 Î¼gm-3 at the city of Luanda. Furthermore, we also find that TROPOMI can already capture the urban NO2 column hotspots over low-emission regions like southern Africa, while this is unavailable from the OMI instrument, highlighting the critical role of high-resolution measurements in understanding atmospheric chemistry issues over southern Africa. Our study presents a deeper understanding of the key emission sources and their impacts over southern Africa that will be helpful not only to formulate targeted pollution controls, but also to enhance the capability to predict future air quality and climate change, which would be beneficial for achieving a healthy, climate-friendly, and resilient development in Africa.

Environmentally Persistent Free Radical Emissions from Indoor Burning of Pelletized Biofuels,"Pelletization of biomass fuels has been promoted as an effective alternative to mitigate particulate matter (PM) emissions from the residential burning of raw biomass materials; however, environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), a class of harmful components in PM, from the biomass pellet burning have been rarely studied yet. Here, laboratory-based combustion experiments were conducted to characterize EPFRs for different pellets burned in cooking and heating stoves and compared with those for the corresponding uncompressed biofuels. Emission factors (EFs) of EPFRs for biomass pellets ranged from 2.97 Ã— 1017 to 2.33 Ã— 1019 spins/kg, following a log-normal distribution, with a geometric mean of 4.21 Ã— 1018 spins/kg. These EPFRs were carbon-centered free radicals adjacent to oxygen atoms. Emissions varied largely across different fuel-stove combinations, with the combustion efficiency and combustion temperature as key influencing factors explaining 49% of the variations in EFPR EFs. Compared to raw fuels, pelletized fuels showed 50-80% lower EPFR EFs and 40-70% lower EPFRs per PM but more different EPFR types, and there was no significant change in the degree of oxidation of the EPFRs. The burning of pellets made from crop residues in a clean cookstove can reduce nearly 90% EFPRs from the raw biomass burning, which is different from the reduction degree in PM mass. This study provides valuable data in promoting the understanding of EPFR formation and deployment of biomass pellets in the protection of air quality and human health.

Improved biomass burning emissions from 1750 to 2010 using ice core records and inverse modeling,"Estimating fire emissions prior to the satellite era is challenging because observations are limited, leading to large uncertainties in the calculated aerosol climate forcing following the preindustrial era. This challenge further limits the ability of climate models to accurately project future climate change. Here, we reconstruct a gridded dataset of global biomass burning emissions from 1750 to 2010 using inverse analysis that leveraged a global array of 31 ice core records of black carbon deposition fluxes, two different historical emission inventories as a priori estimates, and emission-deposition sensitivities simulated by the atmospheric chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. The reconstructed emissions exhibit greater temporal variabilities which are more consistent with paleoclimate proxies. Our ice core constrained emissions reduced the uncertainties in simulated cloud condensation nuclei and aerosol radiative forcing associated with the discrepancy in preindustrial biomass burning emissions. The derived emissions can also be used in studies of ocean and terrestrial biogeochemistry. Â© The Author(s) 2024.",
"A robust black carbon prediction model derived from observational datasets in the Yangtze River Delta region, China","Black carbon (BC) is a short-lived pollutant with significant environment and human health impacts. Monitoring BC is important, but its spatial coverage is limited. Therefore, predicting BC concentration is crucial in densely populated regions like the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). This study explores the machine learning (ML) models, including IAP, LASSO, RF, and SNN, to develop a robust BC prediction model for the YRD, based on BC behavior at the Dianshan Lake (DSL) site. The annual BC concentration at DSL was 1.37 Î¼g/m3, mainly from liquid fuel combustion (68 %), biomass burning (16 %), and coal combustion contributing (16 %). The ML model was first trained with DSL data (June 2021â€“June 2022) and then applied to other YRD sites in four scenarios based on air mass trajectories. The SNN model had R2 values over 0.80 for all scenarios at the DSL site. The model performed better during peak traffic periods, highlighting traffic's impact on BC levels. These models were applied to the YRD sites with R2 from 0.45 to 0.84. Hangzhou (HZ, 0.75â€“0.81), Nanjing (NJ, 0.78â€“0.80), and Pudong (PD, 0.76â€“0.84) showed the highest results. This suggests the model effectively captures BC concentrations from sources with similar emissions and meteorological conditions. Â© 2025 Elsevier Ltd",
"Characterization and sources of carbonaceous aerosol in ambient PM1 in Qingdao, a coastal megacity of northern China from 2017 to 2022","Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) are major chemical constituents of ambient submicron particles (PM1) and have substantial implications for air quality, climate dynamics, and human health. Long-term observations of daily mean mass concentrations of OC and EC in PM1 were conducted in Qingdao, a typical coastal megacity in northern China, in autumn and winter from Nov. 2017 to Jan. 2023. The variety in OC and EC concentrations under the active emission reduction policies of long-term carbon reduction in China, combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, were analyzed. OC and EC concentrations decreased noticeably from 8.28 Â± 4.59 Î¼g mâˆ’3 and 2.00 Â± 1.17 Î¼g mâˆ’3 during pre-COVID-19 pandemic to 6.34 Â± 3.82 Î¼g mâˆ’3 and 1.87 Â± 1.01 Î¼g mâˆ’3 during post-COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The XGBoost-SHAP model indicated that emission sources had the most significant effect on OC and EC concentrations, followed by meteorological factors. Unfavorable meteorological conditions and a substantial increase in emissions are responsible for the increase of OC and EC concentration in winter. Potential source contribution function results indicated that the southern, eastern, and central Shandong regions were the primary source areas for transporting high concentrations of carbonaceous components. Positive matrix factorization analysis suggested that carbonaceous aerosols in Qingdao predominantly originated from coal/biomass combustion (54.75%â€“81.78%) and local vehicle emissions (8.72%â€“28.73%). Compared with that before COVID-19, coal/biomass combustion's contribution to OC and EC decreased by 19% after the COVID-19 pandemic. The contribution of vehicles increased by 110%, possibly due to the increase in motor vehicles and the rapid recovery in diesel consumption in freight transportation. Prohibiting biomass burning, such as open burning of straw, and measures such as promoting low-carbon and clean production of coal-fired industrial furnaces might have played a key role in reducing OC and EC levels. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the concentration levels and sources of carbonaceous components in PM1 and provide theoretical guidance for environmental management.

Source apportionment of PM10 particles in the urban atmosphere using PMF and LPO-XGBoost,"Atmospheric particulate matter (PM), as a leading part of air pollution, affects health in many ways. Thus, identifying and quantifying the contribution of atmospheric particulate matter sources of PM is vital for developing effective air quality management strategies. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) is one of the most common methods for source apportionment. However, PMF has some limitations, particularly its assumption that each source contributes linearly. In reality, some sources may exhibit nonlinear behaviors, which can compromise the accuracy of source apportionment. This study introduces a Lung Performance Optimization-based XGBoost (LPO-XGBoost) model, which leverages adaptive optimization principles inspired by lung function to enhance classic PM source apportionment. We demonstrate the potential for efficient, real-time application of the LPO-XGBoost model across 21 monitoring sites in 6 European countries. Trained and validated on extensive environmental datasets, the model is capable of predicting major pollution sources, including road traffic, biomass burning, crustal, industrial, nitrate-rich particles, sulfate-rich particles, heavy fuel oil, and sea salt. It outperforms other machine learning models with an overall predictive coefficient of determination (r2 = 0.88). Notably, the model performs exceptionally well in predicting sources such as sea salt (r2 = 0.97) and biomass burning (r2 = 0.89), but shows lower accuracy for the sulfate-rich particles source (r2 = 0.75). Comparative analyses with models including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and their LPO-enhanced variants confirm that LPO-XGBoost provides the most reliable performance in estimating pollution source contributions, offering scalability and robustness ideal for high-time-resolution observational data. This model has significant potential to support targeted air quality management strategies. Future research should focus on expanding key species measurements at monitoring sites, ensuring consistent temporal coverage, and optimizing the model for improved mixed-source predictions to strengthen its applicability in comprehensive urban air quality assessments.

Unveiling the Drivers of Cloud Condensation Nuclei Activity: Chemical Transformations and Biomass Burning over Rural India,"Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) are the fraction of the aerosol that participate in the formation and modification of clouds. Comprehensive knowledge of CCN is key to understanding aerosol-cloud interactions, and climate change. The ability of aerosols to act as CCN depends on their size and composition. However, various location-specific factors also determine the CCN activity. To investigate this, long-term observations of CCN, along with collocated measurements of aerosols, gases and meteorological parameters, were analyzed from a rural location, Gadanki (13.50N, 79.20E, 375Â m AMSL) in India. The results suggest biomass burning activities, represented by high values of BC, and CO, contribute to the highest CCN during Marchâ€“April. Conversely, chemical transformations involving O3, SO2, NH3, and VOCs, driven by solar radiation, are linked to high CCN levels observed during April as well as daytime (post 10:00Â h). The similarity between CCN and small particle concentrations (< 0.5Â Âµm, CN) suggests the dominant role of small particles in CCN activation. Furthermore, a detailed multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis was conducted to quantify the factors influencing CCN. Findings indicate that CCN is infleuenced by a combination of factors rather than a single one, with T, and RH having indirect effects. Although the MLR results support the observed variations in CCN, they exhibit bias due to multicollinearity in the dataset. Therefore, a machine learning-based framework is proposed for future research. Nevertheless, the results emphasize the role of chemical transformations and biomass burning in CCN activity in the rural location, Gadanki.

Comprehensive chemical profile and source apportionment of PM2.5 in Buenos Aires: Insights from the southernmost megalopolis,"Understanding aerosol composition is essential for identifying sources and assessing impacts. We analyzed the chemical profile of 100 24-hour PM2.5 samples and used this data for mass reconstruction and source apportionment. Samples were collected between April 2019 and March 2020 at a site located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 4.2 Î¼g mâˆ’3 to 51.4 Î¼g mâˆ’3, with a mean of 17.5 Î¼g mâˆ’3, and maxima during biomass burning (BB) events. Samples were classified according to the presence or absence of BB events affecting the area, and mass reconstruction was performed. Optimal OM/OC ratios were determined to be 2.5 (BB-samples) and 1.9 (non-BB samples), being OM âˆ¼ 65% and âˆ¼ 54%, respectively. On average, other components accounted for âˆ¼ 14% geological minerals > âˆ¼ 10% inorganic ions > âˆ¼ 6% elemental carbon > âˆ¼ 3% sea salt > âˆ¼ 2% non crustal K. Source contributions were further studied using Positive Matrix Factorization. Open biomass burning was the main contributor to PM2.5 (28.4%) and total carbon (25.7%), highlighting the significance of long-range pollutant transport. The temporal variability of this factor aligns with fire events identified using fire location, back-trajectory analysis, and aerosol classification schemes. The remaining factors found were: SOA + soil + road dust (17.7%), mobile sources powered by low sulfur (15.8%) and high sulfur fuels (11.1%), construction + grills (12.1%), agriculture (9.3%) and thermal power plants + industry (5.6%). This study provides relevant information for air quality management, highlighting knowledge gaps on primary and secondary sources affecting the site. Â© 2025",
A study on the impact of meteorological and emission factors on PM2.5 concentrations based on machine learning,"PM2.5 pollution, a major environmental and health concern, is influenced by a complex interplay of emission sources and meteorological conditions. Accurately identifying these factors and their contributions is essential for effective pollution management. This study applies Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to identify primary sources of PM2.5 and uses the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) to quantitatively assess the impact of meteorological and emission factors on PM2.5 concentrations. SHAP results reveal that meteorological factors contribute 16.6% (5.3 Î¼g/m3) to PM2.5, with humidity being the most influential, while emission sources account for 83.4% (26.8 Î¼g/m3), with secondary particulate matter being the dominant factor. Secondary particulate matter and biomass burning significantly impacted PM2.5 in the first and fourth quarters, while dust sources became more influential in the second quarter, and coal emissions were most prominent in the second and third quarters. Two-dimensional PDP analysis indicated that in the first and fourth quarters, secondary particulate matter concentration increased with air pressure, and the atmospheric oxidation process was more pronounced under high-humidity conditions during the day. Strong transport conditions, with wind direction shifting from north to east, also influenced secondary particulate matter levels. This study demonstrates that the LightGBM model effectively captures the nonlinear relationships between PM2.5 and meteorological and emission factors, providing a reliable approach for analyzing the causes of PM2.5 pollution.

"Aerosol Forcing from Ground-Based Synergies over a Decade in Barcelona, Spain","This research aims to estimate long-term aerosol radiative effects by combining radiation and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations in Barcelona, Spain. Aerosol Radiative Forcing and Aerosol Forcing Efficiency (ARF and AFE) were estimated by combining shortwave radiation measurements from a SolRad-Net CM-21 pyranometer (level 1.5) and AERONET AOD (level 2), using the direct method. The shortwave AFE was derived from the slope between net solar radiation and AOD at 440, 675, 879, and 1020 nm, and the ARF was computed by multiplying the AFE by AOD at six solar zenith angles (20Â°, 30Â°, 40Â°, 50Â°, 60Â°, and 70Â°). Clear-sky conditions were selected from all-skies days by a quadratic fitting. The aerosol was classified to investigate the forcing contributions from each aerosol type. The aerosol classification was based on Pace and Toledanoâ€™s thresholds from AOD vs. Ã…ngstrÃ¶m Exponent (AE). The GRASP inversions were performed by combined AOD, radiation, Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) by zenith angles from the polarized sunâ€“skyâ€“lunar photometer and the elastic signal from the UPC-ACTRIS lidar system. The long-term AFE and ARF are both negative, with an increasing tendency (in absolute value) of +24% (AFE) and +40% (ARF) in 14 years. The yearly AFE varied from âˆ’331 to âˆ’10 Wmâˆ’2Ï„âˆ’1, and the ARF varied from âˆ’64 to âˆ’2 Wmâˆ’2, associated with an AOD (440 nm) from 0.016 to 0.690. The three types of aerosols on clear-sky days are mixed aerosols (61%), desert dust (10%), and urban/industrial-biomass burning aerosols (29%). Combined with Gobbiâ€™s method, this classification clustered the aerosols into four groups by AE analysis (two coarse- and two fine-mode aerosols). Then, the contribution of the aerosol types to the ARF showed that the desert dust forcing had the largest cooling effect in Barcelona (âˆ’61.5 to âˆ’37.4 Wmâˆ’2), followed by urban/industrial-biomass burning aerosols (âˆ’40.4 to âˆ’20.4 Wmâˆ’2) and mixed aerosols (âˆ’31.8 and âˆ’24.0 Wmâˆ’2). Regarding the comparison among Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) inversions, AERONET inversions, and direct method estimations, the AFE and ARF had some differences owing to their definitions in the algorithms. The DoLP, used as GRASP input, decreased the ARF overestimation for high AOD. Â© 2025 by the authors.",
"Assessing the Impact of Straw Burning on PM2.5 Using Explainable Machine Learning: A Case Study in Heilongjiang Province, China","Straw burning is recognized as a significant contributor to deteriorating air quality, but its specific impacts, particularly on PM2.5 concentrations, are still not fully understood or quantified. In this study, we conducted a detailed examination of the spatial and temporal patterns of straw burning in Heilongjiang Province, Chinaâ€”a key agricultural areaâ€”utilizing high-resolution fire-point data from the Fengyun-3 satellite. We subsequently employed random forest (RF) models alongside Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAPs) to systematically evaluate the impact of various determinants, including straw burning (as indicated by crop fire-point data), meteorological conditions, and aerosol optical depth (AOD), on PM2.5 levels across spatial and temporal dimensions. Our findings indicated a statistically nonsignificant downward trend in the number of crop fires in Heilongjiang Province from 2015 to 2023, with hotspots mainly concentrated in the western and southern parts of the province. On a monthly scale, straw burning was primarily observed from February to April and October to Novemberâ€”which are critical periods in the agricultural calendarâ€”accounting for 97% of the annual fire counts. The RF models achieved excellent performance in predicting PM2.5 levels, with R2 values of 0.997 for temporal and 0.746 for spatial predictions. The SHAP analysis revealed the number of fire points to be the key determinant of temporal PM2.5 variations during straw-burning periods, explaining 72% of the variance. However, the significance was markedly reduced in the spatial analysis. This study leveraged machine learning and interpretable modeling techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of straw burning on PM2.5 levels, both temporally and spatially. The detailed analysis offers valuable insights for policymakers to formulate more targeted and effective strategies to combat air pollution. Â© 2024 by the authors.",
Higher absorption enhancement of black carbon in summer shown by 2-year measurements at the high-altitude mountain site of Pic du Midi Observatory in the French Pyrenees,"Black-carbon-containing particles strongly absorb light, causing substantial radiative heating of the atmosphere. The climate-relevant properties of black carbon (BC) are poorly constrained in high-altitude mountain regions, where many complex interactions between BC, radiation, clouds and snow have important climate implications. This study presents 2-year measurements of BC microphysical and optical properties at the Pic du Midi (PDM) research station, a high-altitude observatory located at 2877m above sea level in the French Pyrenees. Among the long-term monitoring sites in the world, PDM is subject to limited influence from the planetary boundary layer (PBL), making it a suitable site for characterizing the BC in the free troposphere (FT). The classification of the dominant aerosol type using aerosol spectral optical properties indicates that BC is the predominant aerosol absorption component at PDM and controls the variation in single-scattering albedo (SSA) throughout the 2 years. Single-particle soot photometer (SP2) measurements of refractory BC (rBC) show a mean mass concentration (MrBC) of 35ngm-3 and a relatively constant rBC core mass-equivalent diameter of about 180nm, which are typical values for remote mountain sites. Combining the MrBC with in situ absorption measurements, a rBC mass absorption cross-section (MACrBC) of 9.2Â±3.7m2g-1 at Î»Combining double low line880nm has been obtained, which corresponds to an absorption enhancement (Eabs) of 1/42.2 compared to that of bare rBC particles with equal rBC core size distribution. A significant reduction in the ""MrBC/ ""CO ratio when precipitation occurred along the air mass transport suggests wet removal of rBC. However we found that the wet removal process did not affect the rBC size, resulting in unchanged Eabs. We observed a large seasonal contrast in rBC properties with higher MrBC and Eabs in summer than in winter. In winter a high diurnal variability in MrBC (Eabs) with higher (lower) values in the middle of the day was linked to the injection of rBC originating from the PBL. On the contrary, in summer, MrBC showed no diurnal variation despite more frequent PBL conditions, implying that MrBC fluctuations are rather dominated by regional and long-range transport in the FT. Combining the ""MrBC/ ""CO ratio with air mass transport analysis, we observed additional sources from biomass burning in summer leading to an increase in MrBC and Eabs. The diurnal pattern of Eabs in summer was opposite to that observed in winter with maximum values of 1/42.9 observed at midday. We suggest that this daily variation may result from a photochemical process driving the rBC mixing state rather than a change in BC emission sources. Such direct 2-year observations of BC properties provide quantitative constraints for both regional and global climate models and have the potential to close the gap between model-predicted and observed effects of BC on the regional radiation budget and climate. The results demonstrate the complex influence of BC emission sources, transport pathways, atmospheric dynamics and chemical reactivity in driving the light absorption of BC.  Â© Copyright: ",
Characteristics of secondary inorganic aerosols and contributions to PM2.5 pollution based on machine learning approach in Shandong Province,"Primary emissions of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants, such as SO2 and NOx have decreased in China following the implementation of a series of policies by the Chinese government to address air pollution. However, controlling secondary inorganic aerosol pollution requires attention. This study examined the characteristics of the secondary conversion of nitrate (NO3âˆ’) and sulfate (SO42âˆ’) in three coastal cities of Shandong Province, namely Binzhou (BZ), Dongying (DY), and Weifang (WF), and an inland city, Jinan (JN), during December 2021. Furthermore, the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP), an interpretable attribution technique, was adopted to accurately calculate the contributions of secondary formations to PM2.5. The nitrogen oxidation rate exhibited a significant dependence on the concentration of O3. High humidity facilitates sulfur oxidation. Compared to BZ, DY, and WF, the secondary conversion of NO3âˆ’ and SO42âˆ’ was more intense in JN. The light-gradient boosting model outperformed the random forest and extreme-gradient boosting models, achieving a mean R2 value of 0.92. PM2.5 pollution events in BZ, DY, and WF were primarily attributable to biomass burning, whereas pollution in Jinan was contributed by the secondary formation of NO3âˆ’ and vehicle emissions. Machine learning and the SHAP interpretable attribution technique offer a precise analysis of the causes of air pollution, showing high potential for addressing environmental concerns. Â© 2023",
Validation and calibration of aerosol optical depth and classification of aerosol types based on multi-source data over China,"A refined classification of aerosol types is essential to identify and control air pollution sources. This study focused on improving the resolution and accuracy of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and further refining the classification of aerosol types in China. We validated the accuracy of the AOD acquired using the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) by comparing it with that acquired using from the Aeronet Robotic Network (AERONET). We simulated the AOD with high spatial resolution and accuracy based on the extremely randomized trees (ERT), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) models and identified aerosol types based on the Angstrom Exponent (AE) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the calibrated AOD. The results showed that CAMS overestimates AOD (21.4 %) and MERRA2 underestimates AOD (âˆ’17.3 %). Among the three machine learning models, the ERT model performed best, with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.825 and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.174. Biomass burning/urban-industrial aerosols dominated China, with the largest contributions to southern, eastern, and central China in spring and summer. Clean continental aerosols contributed the most to southwestern China in fall and winter, whereas desert dust aerosols contributed the most to northwestern and eastern China in spring.

A comparison of atmospheric aerosol absorption properties from the MERRA-2 reanalysis with AERONET,"Our focus is the comparison of atmospheric aerosol absorption properties between the MERRA-2 reanalysis and the inversion product of the surface station network AERONET. We use the available Aerosol Absorption Optical Depth (AAOD) and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) data from both sources during the period 1993â€“2022, for the globe. The comparison is performed for the whole dataset, but also repeated for different classifications, namely by aerosol types, KÃ¶ppen climate, and continent. Moreover, we investigate the relationships between these classifications. For these medium and high optical depth cases, the MERRA-2 relative bias for AAOD and SSA is globally âˆ’3.7% and âˆ’1.4%, but there is a wide differentiation in performance for the different types, climates, and continents. The MERRA-2 SSA frequency distribution is too narrow compared to the AERONET. MERRA-2 strongly overestimates the absorption over N. America and less so over S. America and Europe, while it underestimates it greatly over Oceania. AAOD is underestimated over biomass-burning regions and overestimated over most areas rich in dust. There is evidence that the lack of brown carbon in the aerosol type classification scheme in MERRA-2 hampers its performance. The comparison over Asia dry areas (classified as KÃ¶ppen climate type B) shows a large underestimation in AAOD, non-existent in other dry (B) climate types. For the relatively few observations over polar (KÃ¶ppen type E) climates, MERRA-2 gives too absorptive aerosols. With respect to absorption properties, it appears that MERRA-2 would improve its agreement with AERONET by addressing some erroneous aerosol classifications, employing the brown carbon type, and introducing more detail in dry region aerosol sources.

Morphological classification of fine particles in transmission electron microscopy images by using pre-trained convolution neural networks,"Morphological information on fine particles is essential for understanding their transport behavior in the ambient atmosphere and in the human respiratory system. More than 3000 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of fine particles were collected from ambient atmosphere and directly from various sources, such as diesel and gasoline engine exhaust, biomass burning, coal combustion, and road dust, and were then morphologically categorized into four major classes (spherical, agglomerate, polygonal, and dendrite). Pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models (DenseNet169, InceptionV3, MobileNetV3Small, ResNet50, and VGG16) and traditional machine learning models (decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines) were trained using the classified particles. The fine-tuned CNN model (DenseNet169) having the deepest feature learning exhibited the best performance among the tested models, with an overall classification accuracy of 89% and an average per-class accuracy ranging from 84% to 97%. The reliable classification of thousands of images was performed within several minutes. The agglomerated class was the least misclassified because of its significantly different features from those of the other classes. The critical regions of the particles for classification decisions varied among the pre-trained models. Our results suggest that the pre-trained CNN models would be useful for the rapid morphological classification of a large number of fine particles.

"Linking gas, particulate, and toxic endpoints to air emissions in the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM)","Chemical mechanisms describe the atmospheric transformations of organic and inorganic species and connect air emissions to secondary species such as ozone, fine particles, and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) like formaldehyde. Recent advances in our understanding of several chemical systems and shifts in the drivers of atmospheric chemistry warrant updates to mechanisms used in chemical transport models such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. This work builds on the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism version 2 (RACM2) and develops the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM) version 1.0, which demonstrates a fully coupled representation of chemistry leading to ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) with consideration of HAPs. CRACMMv1.0 includes 178 gas-phase species, 51 particulate species, and 508 reactions spanning gas-phase and heterogeneous pathways. To support estimation of health risks associated with HAPs, nine species in CRACMM cover 50g% of the total cancer and 60g% of the total non-cancer emission-weighted toxicity estimated for primary HAPs from anthropogenic and biomass burning sources in the US, with the coverage of toxicity higher (>g%) when secondary formaldehyde and acrolein are considered. In addition, new mechanism species were added based on the importance of their emissions for the ozone, organic aerosol, or atmospheric burden of total reactive organic carbon (ROC): sesquiterpenes, furans, propylene glycol, alkane-like low-to intermediate-volatility organic compounds (9 species), low-to intermediate-volatility oxygenated species (16 species), intermediate-volatility aromatic hydrocarbons (2 species), and slowly reacting organic carbon. Intermediate-and lower-volatility organic compounds were estimated to increase the coverage of anthropogenic and biomass burning ROC emissions by 40g% compared to current operational mechanisms. Autoxidation, a gas-phase reaction particularly effective in producing SOA, was added for C10 and larger alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenes, and monoterpene systems including second-generation aldehydes. Integrating the radical and SOA chemistry put additional constraints on both systems and enabled the implementation of previously unconsidered SOA pathways from phenolic and furanone compounds, which were predicted to account for g1/4g30g% of total aromatic hydrocarbon SOA under typical atmospheric conditions. CRACMM organic aerosol species were found to span the atmospherically relevant range of species carbon number, number of oxygens per carbon, and oxidation state with a slight high bias in the number of hydrogens per carbon. In total, 11 new emitted species were implemented as precursors to SOA compared to current CMAQv5.3.3 representations, resulting in a bottom-up prediction of SOA, which is required for accurate source attribution and the design of control strategies. CRACMMv1.0 is available in CMAQv5.4.  Â© 2023 The Author(s).",
A machine learning modelling approach to characterize the background pollution in the Western Macedonia region in northwest Greece,"The background PM10 concentration in the Western Macedonia region, a complex terrain area with combined urban and industrial emission sources is investigated in this study. PM10 measurements were collected from a remote agricultural monitoring site situated in the southern part of the region and outside the industrial basin over a 12-year period (2010â€“2021). The ongoing reduction in lignite production during the last decade resulted in considerable changes in particulate emissions in the area. To take into account the changes in the air quality of the region the whole period was divided into two subperiods of common air pollution characteristics. For each period, Hidden Markov Models clustering was applied to the deseasonalized daily PM10 concentrations and the corresponding diurnal amplitudes to extract groups of similar characteristics (clusters) and define the background pollution. The average background concentration was estimated at 15.9 Î¼g/m3 during the period 2010â€“2015 followed by a decrease of 3.1 Î¼g/m3 to 12.8 Î¼g/m3 during the second study period (2016â€“2021). The examination of the long-term changes in the background concentration revealed a statistically significant decreasing annual trend of âˆ’0.39 Î¼g/m3 that reflected the air quality improvement of the region during the last decade. Additionally, background concentrations co-existed with favorable meteorological conditions such as higher wind speeds during the cold period (Octoberâ€“March) diminishing the contribution of local anthropogenic emissions (biomass burning for heating purposes) and a less developed mixing layer during the warm period (Aprilâ€“September) impeding the impact of the particulate plumes from the nearby power plants.

Biomass Burning Greatly Enhances the Concentration of Fine Carbonaceous Aerosols at an Urban Area in Upper Northern Thailand: Evidence From the Radiocarbon-Based Source Apportionment on Size-Resolved Aerosols,"To study the role of biomass burning (BB) in air pollution at upper-northern Thailand, the source apportionment of size-resolved carbonaceous aerosols from Chiang Mai was carried out based on the radiocarbon (14C) analysis. The fraction of modern carbon (F14C) was generally decreased with particle size increasing and with the highest and lowest values of 0.90Â Â±Â 0.04 and 0.61Â Â±Â 0.04, respectively. Elemental carbon, regardless of emission sources, and BB-derived organic carbon (OCbb) showed unimodal size distribution patterns with peaks at 0.43â€“0.65Â Î¼m. Fossil-fuel derived-OC (OCf) displayed a bimodal mode with the major peak at 2.1â€“10Â Î¼m, and the minor one at 0.43â€“0.65Â Î¼m. The biogenic secondary organic aerosols (BSOA) showed a typical fine-mode unimodal size distribution pattern during the high BB (HBB) season, and a bimodal mode during the low BB season. The BSOA concentration increased by 189%Â Â±Â 80% due to the interaction with open BB plums during HBB season, which was quantified by a 14C-involved random forest model. Besides, the concentration of biogenic primary organic aerosols also showed a significant increment during the HBB season, especially in sub-microns. Our results highlight the critical importance of controlling open fires to reduce air pollutants and the potential exposure risk. Â© 2024. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",
Analysis of aerosol characteristics in the North Yellow Sea based on the calibration and validation field network of autonomous ocean satellites,"Satellite remote sensing observations and on-site observations on offshore platforms are currently the two most mainstream means of observing characteristics of marine aerosols. Among them, satellite remote sensing observations have the advantage of a wide range of observations, while on-site observations on offshore platforms can obtain observation data with higher time resolution, and have the advantages of easy calibration and maintenance, and high-quality observation data. By using the measured aerosol optical thickness data from the Calibration Validation Field Network of Autonomous Ocean Satellites in the North Yellow Sea, the main aerosol types and optical properties of the offshore station are discussed to provide theoretical and technical support for the calibration and validation of autonomous ocean satellites, as well as the commercial operation of autonomous calibration and validation field networks. Using data from January 2020-June 2023, the data were classified into six main aerosol types according to the graphical classification: clean, desert dust, continental, subcontinental, urban industrial and biomass burning aerosols, and the main aerosol particles at the stations were analyzed by the ESI, single scattering albedo and fine mode fraction. The results show that spring is the most polluted season among the four seasons in the area, continental-type aerosols dominate throughout the year, and the main aerosol type at the station is a continental type aerosol with weak and moderate absorption coarse particle mode.

"Remote sensing of nighttime air quality over the megacity of Lahore, Pakistan","In recent years, air quality is deteriorating which causes severe impacts on the climate system, and human health, particularly in the mega-cities of Pakistan. As we enter an era of more health related issues, poor air quality and rapid climate change, therefore the implications for nighttime air quality need to be better understood for air quality improvement. In this paper, for the first time, the nighttime air quality of Lahore was assessed using data from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) over Lahore during the period April 2021â€“August 2022. The highest mean monthly Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Water Vapour Content (WVC) of 1.29 and 5.3 cm were observed in July 2022, respectively, whereas the highest Angstrom Exponent (AE) value of 1.5 occurred in August 2022. Moreover, the nighttime aerosol classification using the association between AOD and AE reveals the dominance of Background Conditions (BC), Urban Industrial/Biomass Burning aerosols (UI/BB), Desert Dust (DD) and Mixed Type (MT) aerosols. Over a couple of previous years, Lahore has witnessed worse air quality mainly due to biomass burning, dust aerosols, industrial pollutants and fuel combustion. Therefore, our main focus was on DD and UI/BB aerosols along with their source regions. We have also used the HYSPLIT model to understand the transport of nighttime aerosols. Moreover, nighttime high concentrations of mean monthly Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Ozone (O3) were observed in March and May 2022, respectively. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.",
Rapid Classification of Aerosol Particle Mass Spectra Using Data Augmentation and Deep Learning,"The concentration and chemical composition of airborne aerosol particles are important indicators of air quality and sources of air pollution. The particles' chemical composition reveals probable emission sources, like traffic, biomass burning, wildfires, agriculture, or industrial sources. Single-particle mass spectrometry (SPMS), combined with rapid spectral classification, uniquely enables an in-situ analysis of the chemical composition of individual aerosol particles in real-time for environmental monitoring and other tasks. Modern SPMS devices analyze hundreds of individual particles per minute. Rapid and accurate classification of such large amounts of data remains challenging. Conventional clustering algorithms require tedious manual post-processing. A mass spectrum can be understood as a 1D image per analyzed particle. We applied CNN-based algorithms to perform a fully automated classification. To train the models, usually a large amount of labeled data needs to be prepared. With a manually created benchmark dataset containing 10,400 samples in 13 classes of emission sources (800 samples per class) we achieved an accuracy of ~90%. If the models are trained using only 100 labeled samples per class (1/8 labeled data), the models' accuracy drops significantly to ~75%. We explored suitable augmentation methods to improve the reliability and performance of multi-class classification for aerosol particle mass spectra in case of limited labeled data (1/8 labeled data). The results using the augmented data improved from ~75% to 86.8%. This paves the way to sharply reduce the expensive and time-consuming work of expert labeling. Furthermore, we verified that converting the 1D mass spectrum into 2D representations and classifying them using 2D-CNN is more efficient than 1D-CNN networks, whether with or without data augmentation.

Application of multiplatform remote sensing data over East Asia Ocean: aerosol characteristics and aerosol types,"It is important to explore the characteristics and rules of atmospheric aerosol in the East Asian Sea for monitoring and evaluating atmospheric environmental quality. Based on Aerosol Robot Network (AERONET), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS), and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data, the temporal and spatial variation characteristics and differences of aerosol parameters and types in the East Asian Sea were studied by using figure classification method (FIGCM), aerosol optical depth (AOD)440-Angstrom exponent (AE)440â€“870 method (AA1M), and AOD550-AE490-670 method (AA2M). The results show that the seasonal variation trend of aerosol characteristics and types is obvious in East Asia Sea. AOD, volume concentration (Cv), and aerosol effective radius (reff) in the Bohai-Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan in autumn are lower than those in other seasons, and the occurrence frequency of ocean-type aerosols is high. Different from the Bohai-Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan, human activities in winter, summer, and autumn seriously affect the air quality in the East China Sea and South China Sea. Especially at the Taipei CWB site, from aerosol parameters and high biomass burning/urban industrial (BB/UI) aerosol, human activity is an important factor for high pollution at the Taipei CWB site. Aerosol types of AA1M, FIGCM, AA2M, and CALIPSO were compared at Anmyon and Yonsei University sites in the Bohai-Yellow Sea in March 2020. The results show that aerosol types based on threshold classification methods generally have higher mixed aerosol results, and the marine (MA) results of AA1M, FIGCM, and AA2M are close to the clean marine aerosol results of CALIPSO. Comparing the results of AA 2Â M and CALIPSO on a spatial scale, it is found that the clean marine aerosol proportion identified by CALIPSO (0.38, 0.48, 0.82) is consistent with the MA proportion identified by AA 2Â M (0.43, 0.46, 0.97) in the East China Sea, South China Sea, and Western Pacific Ocean.

Aerosol Types Identification over the Arabian Peninsula Using AERONET Products: Evaluation with Multisource Datasets,"Knowing aerosol size and composition is essential for studying aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) and human health impacts, identifying their sources, and improving satellite aerosol estimation methods. An aerosol classification technique (T1) is proposed here using K-mean clustering analysis based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD500Â nm) vs Angstrom Exponent (AE440â€“870Â nm) data (1999â€“2018) from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) in the Arabian Peninsula. The proposed classified aerosol types are: (1) Clean background/clean maritime (CB/CM): AOD < 0.20 & AE < 1.35; (2) Clean Continental (CC): AOD < 0.20 & AE > 1.35; (3) Desert Dust (DD): AOD > 0.20 & AE < 0.6; (4) Dusty Mixture (DM): AOD > 0.20 & 0.60 < AE < 1.0; (5) Urban Industrial (UI): AOD > 0.20 & 1.0 < AE < 1.35; and (6) Biomass Burning (BB): AOD > 0.20 & AE > 1.35. Further verification of our results was conducted with respect to AERONET depolarization ratio (Î´), surface observations (e.g., wind speed, relative humidity, and visibility), and dust RGB products from Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor onboard the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite. The T1 reveals that DD was prevalent at the Solar Village in Riyadh (51%), and the KAUST Campus (47.65%) and Hada-El-Sham (37.39%) in Jeddah. Additionally, urban industrial and biomass burning aerosol types were observed due to an increase in industrial activities and biofuel emissions. The evaluation study showed that other previously published techniques (e.g., T2, T3, and T4) misclassified aerosol types, whereas T1 significantly classified aerosol types. Moreover, back trajectory analysis based on the NOAA HYSPLIT model demonstrated that the predominant DD- and other-aerosols originated and transported from both local and external sources of the Arabian Peninsula. Finally, the study examined ARF from AERONET and SBDART (the Santa Barbara DISTORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) models, which found that scattering radiation at the top and bottom of the atmosphere cooled the atmosphere, while absorbing radiation within the atmosphere heated the atmosphere. As a result of the present study, specific aerosol types are now classified and recognized as well as they may have a direct impact on local and regional climate change and radiation budget over the Arabian Peninsula.

Dynamic savanna burning emission factors based on satellite data using a machine learning approach,"Landscape fires, predominantly found in the frequently burning global savannas, are a substantial source of greenhouse gases and aerosols. The impact of these fires on atmospheric composition is partially determined by the chemical breakup of the constituents of the fuel into individual emitted chemical species, which is described by emission factors (EFs). These EFs are known to be dependent on, amongst other things, the type of fuel consumed, the moisture content of the fuel, and the meteorological conditions during the fire, indicating that savanna EFs are temporally and spatially dynamic. Global emission inventories, however, rely on static biome-averaged EFs, which makes them ill-suited for the estimation of regional biomass burning (BB) emissions and for capturing the effects of shifts in fire regimes. In this study we explore the main drivers of EF variability within the savanna biome and assess which geospatial proxies can be used to estimate dynamic EFs for global emission inventories. We made over 4500 bag measurements of CO2, CO, CH4, and N2O EFs using a UAS and also measured fuel parameters and fire-severity proxies during 129 individual fires. The measurements cover a variety of savanna ecosystems under different seasonal conditions sampled over the course of six fire seasons between 2017 and 2022. We complemented our own data with EFs from 85 fires with locations and dates provided in the literature. Based on the locations, dates, and times of the fires we retrieved a variety of fuel, weather, and fire-severity proxies (i.e. possible predictors) using globally available satellite and reanalysis data. We then trained random forest (RF) regressors to estimate EFs for CO2, CO, CH4, and N2O at a spatial resolution of 0.25 and a monthly time step. Using these modelled EFs, we calculated their spatiotemporal impact on BB emission estimates over the 2002-2016 period using the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4 with small fires (GFED4s). We found that the most important field indicators for the EFs of CO2, CO, and CH4 were tree cover density, fuel moisture content, and the grass-to-litter ratio. The grass-to-litter ratio and the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio were important indicators for N2O EFs. RF models using satellite observations performed well for the prediction of EF variability in the measured fires with out-of-sample correlation coefficients between 0.80 and 0.99, reducing the error between measured and modelled EFs by 60%-85% compared to using the static biome average. Using dynamic EFs, total global savanna emission estimates for 2002-2016 were 1.8% higher for CO, while CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions were, respectively, 0.2%, 5%, and 18% lower compared to GFED4s. On a regional scale we found a spatial redistribution compared to GFED4s with higher CO, CH4, and N2O EFs in mesic regions and lower ones in xeric regions. Over the course of the fire season, drying resulted in gradually lower EFs of these species. Relatively speaking, the trend was stronger in open savannas than in woodlands, where towards the end of the fire season they increased again. Contrary to the minor impact on annual average savanna fire emissions, the model predicts localized deviations from static averages of the EFs of CO, CH4, and N2O exceeding 60% under seasonal conditions.

Key toxic components and sources affecting oxidative potential of atmospheric particulate matter using interpretable machine learning: Insights from fog episodes,"Fog significantly affects the air quality and human health. To investigate the health effects and mechanisms of atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during fog episodes, PM2.5 samples were collected from the coastal suburb of Qingdao during different seasons from 2021 to 2022, with the major chemical composition in PM2.5 analyzed. The oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5 was determined using the dithiothreitol (DTT) method. A positive matrix factorization model was adopted for PM2.5. Interpretable machine learning (IML) was used to reveal and quantify the key components and sources affecting OP. PM2.5 exhibited higher oxidative toxicity during fog episodes. Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), NH4+, K+, and water-soluble Fe positively affected the enhancement of DTTV (volume-based DTT activity) during fog episodes. The IML analysis demonstrated that WSOC and K+ contributed significantly to DTTV, with values of 0.31 Â± 0.34 and 0.27 Â± 0.22 nmol minâˆ’1 mâˆ’3, respectively. Regarding the sources, coal combustion and biomass burning contributed significantly to DTTV (0.40 Â± 0.38 and 0.39 Â± 0.36 nmol minâˆ’1 mâˆ’3, respectively), indicating the significant influence of combustion-related sources on OP. This study provides new insights into the effects of PM2.5 compositions and sources on OP by applying IML models. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.",
The role of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) in constraining BrC absorption in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP),"We present here the first measurements of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) including nitrophenols (NPs), nitrocatechols (NCs) and nitrosalicylic acids (NSAs) from the Indian subcontinent and their role in constraining brown carbon (BrC) absorption. NACs at a rural receptor site in the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) (annual average: 185 Â± 94 ng mâˆ’3) was dominated by NSAs (135 Â± 77 ng mâˆ’3), followed by NPs (29 Â± 11 ng mâˆ’3) and NCs (17 Â± 16 ng mâˆ’3), with notable enrichments during nighttime and during the biomass burning seasons. An equilibrium absorption partitioning model estimated that >90 % of NSAs and NCs were in the particle-phase, suggesting lower degradation rates via oxidation and photolysis potentially due to year-round high relative humidity. While the contribution of NACs to organic aerosol mass was only 0.42 Â± 0.23 %, their contribution to BrC absorption in the 300â€“450 nm range was higher by an order of magnitude (8 Â± 4 %), with NCs and NSAs contributing almost equally in the low-visible (400â€“450 nm) range as at 365 nm. Despite having mass concentrations lower than NPs by factors of âˆ¼2, contribution of NCs to BrC absorption at Î» â‰¥ 400 nm was comparable to that by NPs, indicating the importance of the absorption efficiency of chromophores. The receptor model positive matrix factorization (PMF) quantified three major NAC sources: fossil fuel combustion (49 Â± 15 %; annual average), secondary formation (40 Â± 12 %), and biomass burning (11 Â± 9 %), with variable contributions on seasonal and day-night bases. In summary, the study uncovered the significant role of NACs in constraining BrC absorption in the IGP, which stresses the importance for molecular-level characterization of BrC chromophores.

"Development of Spatio-Temporal Land Use Regression Models for Fine Particulate Matter and Wood-Burning Tracers in Temuco, Chile","Biomass burning is common in much of the world, and in some areas, residential wood-burning has increased. However, air pollution resulting from biomass burning is an important public health problem. A sampling campaign was carried out between May 2017 and July 2018 in over 64 sites in four sessions, to develop a spatio-temporal land use regression (LUR) model for fine particulate matter (PM) and wood-burning tracers levoglucosan and soluble potassium (Ksol) in a city heavily impacted by wood-burning. The mean (sd) was 46.5 (37.4) Î¼g m-3 for PM2.5, 0.607 (0.538) Î¼g m-3 for levoglucosan, and 0.635 (0.489) Î¼g m-3 for Ksol. LUR models for PM2.5, levoglucosan, and Ksol had a satisfactory performance (LOSOCV R2), explaining 88.8%, 87.4%, and 87.3% of the total variance, respectively. All models included sociodemographic predictors consistent with the pattern of use of wood-burning in homes. The models were applied to predict concentrations surfaces and to estimate exposures for an epidemiological study. Â© 2023 American Chemical Society.",
Machine learning assesses drivers of PM2.5 air pollution trend in the Tibetan Plateau from 2015 to 2022,"The Tibetan Plateau (known as the Earth's Third Pole) has significant impact on climate. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an important air pollutant in this region and has significant impact on health and climate. To mitigate PM2.5 air pollution over China, a series of clean air actions has been implemented. However, interannual trends in particulate air pollution and its response to anthropogenic emissions in the Tibetan Plateau are poorly understood. Here, we applied a random forest (RF) algorithm to quantify drivers of PM2.5 trends in six cities of the Tibetan Plateau from 2015 to 2022. The decreasing trends (âˆ’5.31 to âˆ’0.73 Î¼g mâˆ’3 aâˆ’1) in PM2.5 during 2015â€“2022 were observed in all cities. The RF weather-normalized PM2.5 trends â€“ which were driven by anthropogenic emissions â€“ were âˆ’4.19 to âˆ’0.56 Î¼g mâˆ’3 aâˆ’1, resulting in dominant contributions (65 %â€“83 %) to the observed PM2.5 trends. Relative to 2015, such anthropogenic emission driver was estimated to contribute âˆ’27.12 to âˆ’3.16 Î¼g mâˆ’3 to declines in PM2.5 concentrations in 2022. However, the interannual changes in meteorological conditions only made a small contribution to the trends in PM2.5 concentrations. Potential source analysis suggested biomass burning from local residential sector and/or long-range transports originated from South Asia could significantly promote PM2.5 air pollution in this region. Based on health-risk air quality index (HAQI) assessment, the HAQI value was decreased by 15 %â€“76 % between 2015 and 2022 in these cities, with significant contributions (47 %â€“93 %) from anthropogenic emission abatements. Indeed, relative contribution of PM2.5 to the HAQI was decreased from 16 %â€“30 % to 11 %â€“18 %, while increasing and significant contribution from ozone was observed, highlighting that further effective mitigation of both PM2.5 and ozone air pollution could obtain more substantial health benefits in the Tibetan Plateau.

Plant versus local soil inorganic ionic composition: The relationship to biomass smoke,"We examine the relationship between soil and plant inorganic chemical composition as a precursor to biomass smoke aerosol particle (PM2.5) properties in desert landscapes of the Southwestern United States. Past work underscored the importance of plant species and in particular the dependence of smoke PM2.5 water uptake on the water-soluble inorganics important in select plant species (e.g., halophytes) versus absent in other species (e.g., conifers). This study extends this work by looking at a range of soil types and salinity in examining native and invasive species in the Desert Southwest US region. Eighteen plant samples and surrounding soils were taken from four ecosystems in New Mexico, USA. Results here support the conclusion that plant species are the primary controller over the inorganic plant composition that is relevant to biomass smoke and controls its hygroscopicity. The role of soil type is secondary to plant inorganic composition but is found to be important on the ecosystem level in determining what plant species are viable in a given ecosystem. This ultimately affects the smoke properties, including PM2.5 hygroscopicity (water uptake), produced in landscape fires. Knowledge of ecosystem features including plant species distribution and soil salinity may be combined as a first-order predictor of PM2.5 hygroscopicity of the primary smoke emissions. This can be particularly useful when combined with knowledge of burn characteristics such as flame temperature, which also plays a key role in determining PM2.5 water uptake response.

Real-Time Source Apportionment of Particulate Matter from Low-Cost Particle Sensors Using Machine Learning,"Low-cost sensors (LCS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their application in urban air quality mapping, community monitoring networks, indoor air quality monitoring, personal exposure monitoring, and citizen science initiatives. This study has developed an integrated approach combining measurements from LCS and existing source apportionment (SA) results with machine learning (ML) algorithms to achieve real-time SA. Source contributions apportioned by Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) model and PM2.5 as well as particle number concentration (PNC) in size bins (0â€“0.3Â Î¼m, 0.3â€“0.5Â Î¼m, 0.5â€“1Â Î¼m, and 1â€“2.5Â Î¼m) from LCS are acquired from May 2019 to February 2020 at Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium (NS), Delhi. The PNC in size bins was converted to mass (PM0 âˆ’ 0.3, PM0.3 âˆ’ 0.5, PM0.5 âˆ’ 1, PM1 âˆ’ 2.5) for respective sizes. The objective function is {S1, S2, S3, â€¦. S8} = f {PM0 âˆ’ 0.3, PM0.3 âˆ’ 0.5, PM0.5 âˆ’ 1, PM1 âˆ’ 2.5, PM2.5} where S1, S2, S3, â€¦. S8 are the sources. Four ML algorithms, namely support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbour (kNN), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB), are applied for SA. GB performs the best among all algorithms with a train and test score (R2) of 0.82 and 0.75. The R2 (in parentheses) between actual and predicted PM2.5 for sources of biomass burning (0.92), dust (0.83), gasoline vehicle (0.75), diesel vehicle (0.78), coal combustion (0.70), waste burning (0.76), industrial (0.77) and secondary aerosol (0.89) indicate the acceptable performance of the model. The statistical t-test comparing the PM2.5 contributions obtained from CMB and ML for each source indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05) except for dust and waste burning. This study demonstrated the ability of LCS to perform real-time SA with the help of an existing dataset. This cost-effective approach will provide rough estimations of the sources to regulatory agencies and policymakers for immediate action.

"A long-term, dispersion normalized PMF source apportionment of PM2.5 in Atlanta from 2005 to 2019","This study assessed the effects of policy implementations and economic drivers on the identified sources of particulate pollution and their contributions to the ambient PM2.5 concentrations in Atlanta, Georgia during 2005â€“2019. Dispersion-normalized positive matrix factorization (DN-PMF) was applied to account for meteorological impacts on the ambient concentrations. Secondary sulfate, gasoline vehicle, diesel vehicle, biomass burning, secondary nitrate, dust/road dust, aged sea salt, copper and pyrolyzed carbon were resolved for the study period. Among them, secondary sulfate was the largest contributor to the PM2.5 mass concentrations. A substantial decrease in its concentrations was observed both after 2008 and after 2017 due to the implementation of the Georgia Multipollutant Control for Electric Utility Steam Generating Units rule in 2007 and the new Tier 3 Motor Vehicle Emission Standards in 2017. Emissions from gasoline and diesel vehicles as well as secondary nitrate also decreased after 2008. However, the reductions in gasoline and diesel emissions can be attributed to the two years of economic recession, implementation of the Georgia Gasoline Marketing Rule and regulations under the Heavy-Duty Diesel Rule. The decrease in emissions of secondary nitrate was observed after introduction of entire year control on NOx emissions promulgated by the regulations under the Clean Air Interstate rule and the Georgia NOx Emission from Electric Utility Stream Generating Units rule. Alternatively, elevated summer values were characteristic of the biomass burning, pyrolyzed carbon and dust/road dust factors. The elevated summer biomass burning emissions in 2019 were likely due to two wildfires southwest of Atlanta, while the elevated summer dust/road dust factor values were due to transported Saharan dust episodes. Identification of the copper factor at this Atlanta site was linked to the poor venting of a high-volume sampler with a copper brush motor. Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd",
The fate of rice crop residues and context-dependent greenhouse gas emissions: Model-based insights from Eastern India,"Crop residue burning is a common practice in many parts of the world that causes air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Regenerative practices that return residues to the soil offer a â€˜no burnâ€™ pathway for addressing air pollution while building soil organic carbon (SOC). Nevertheless, GHG emissions in rice-based agricultural systems are complex and difficult to anticipate, particularly in production contexts with highly variable hydrologic conditions. Here we predict long-term net GHG fluxes for four rice residue management strategies in the context of rice-wheat cropping systems in Eastern India: burning, soil incorporation, livestock fodder, and biochar. Estimations were based on a combination of Tier 1, 2, and 3 modelling approaches, including 100-year DNDC simulations across three representative soil hydrologic categories (i.e., dry, median, and wet). Overall, residue burning resulted in total direct GHG fluxes of 2.5, 6.1, and 8.7 Mg CO2-e in the dry, median, and wet hydrologic categories, respectively. Relative to emissions from burning (positive values indicate an increase) for the same dry to wet hydrologic categories, soil incorporation resulted in a âˆ’0.2, 1.8, or 3.1 Mg CO2-e change in emissions whereas use of residues for livestock fodder increased emissions by 2.0, 2.1, or 2.3 Mg CO2-e. Biochar reduced emissions relative to burning by 2.9 Mg CO2-e in all hydrologic categories. This study showed that the production environment has a controlling effect on methane and, therefore, net GHG balance. For example, wetter sites had 2.8â€“4.0 times greater CH4 emissions, on average, than dry sites when rice residues were returned to the soil. To effectively mitigate burning without undermining climate change mitigation goals, our results suggest that geographically-target approaches should be used in the rice-based systems of Eastern India to incentivize the adoption of regenerative â€˜no burnâ€™ residue management practices.

Improving Machine Learning Based PM2.5 Prediction by Segregating Biomass Emission Factor from Chemical Transport Model,"Located in the heart of Mainland Southeast Asia, Thailand is associated with high biomass burning (BB) activities from local and neighbouring countries. The seasonal pattern of BB manifests itself as a potential predictor for PM2.5 concentration. Consequently, we enhanced machine learning based PM2.5 prediction by segregating BB factor from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ). Two Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models with different CMAQ predictors were developed: the BB-integrated model, which incorporated CMAQ-simulated PM2.5 from all emission sources and the BB-segregated model, which incorporated CMAQ-simulated PM2.5 from sources other than BB (CMAQ_PM25_Othr) and CMAQ-simulated PM2.5 from BB emissions (CMAQ_PM25_BB). The two models had shared control predictors, which included simulated meteorological variables from WRF model, population, elevation, and land-use variables, and they were evaluated using a crossvalidation (CV). The BB-segregated model outperformed the BB-integrated model, achieving overall-CV R2 values of 0.86 and 0.82, respectively. The analysis of feature importance for the BB-segregated model indicates that CMAQ_PM25_Othr and CMAQ_PM25_BB are the two most significant predictors. These findings emphasize the importance of considering BB emissions when predicting PM2.5 concentrations, particularly in regions with high BB activities.

Black carbon concentrations and modeled smoke deposition fluxes to the bare-ice dark zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet,"Ice-albedo feedbacks in the ablation region of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) are difficult to constrain and model due, in part, to our limited understanding of the seasonal evolution of the bare-ice region. To help fill observational gaps, 13 surface samples were collected on the GrIS across the 2014 summer melt season from patches of snow and ice that were visibly light, medium, and dark colored. These samples were analyzed for their refractory black carbon (rBC) concentrations and size distributions with a single-particle soot photometer coupled to a characterized nebulizer. We present a size distribution of rBC in fresh snow on the GrIS and from the weathering crust in the bare-ice dark zone of the GrIS. The size distributions from the weathering crust samples appear unimodal and were overall smaller than the fresh snow sample, with a peak around 0.3 Î¼m. The fresh snow sample contained very large rBC particles that had a pronounced bimodality in the peak size distributions, with peaks around 0.2 and 2 Î¼m. rBC concentrations ranged from a minimum of 3 Î¼g-rBC/L-H2O in light-colored patches at the beginning and end of the melt season to a maximum of 32 Î¼g-rBC/L-H2O in a dark patch in early August. On average, the rBC concentrations were higher (20 Â± 10 Î¼g-rBC/L-H2O) in patches that were visibly dark, compared to medium patches (7 Â± 2 Î¼g-rBC/L-H2O) and light patches (4 Â± 1 Î¼g-rBC/L-H2O), suggesting that BC aggregation contributed to snow aging on the GrIS, and vice versa. Additionally, concentrations peaked in light and dark patches in early August, which is likely due to smoke transport from wildfires in northern Canada and Alaska, as supported by the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) reanalysis model. According to the model output, 26 mgm-3 of biomass-burning-derived smoke was deposited between 1 April and 30 August, of which 85 % came from wet deposition, and 67 % was deposited during our sample collection time frame. The increase in the rBC concentration and size distributions immediately after the modeled smoke deposition fluxes suggest that biomass burning smoke is a source of BC to the dark zone of the GrIS. Thus, the role of BC in the seasonal evolution of the ice-albedo feedbacks should continue to be investigated in the weathering crust of the bare-ice zone of the GrIS. Â© 2023 Alia L. Khan et al.",
1D-CNN Network Based Real-Time Aerosol Particle Classification with Single-Particle Mass Spectrometry,"Single-particle mass spectrometry (SPMS) is a measurement technique that aims to identify the chemical composition of individual airborne aerosol particles (PM 1 or PM 2.5) in real time. One-dimensional (1-D) spectral data of aerosol particles generated by SPMS carry rich information about the chemical composition associated with the sources of the particles, e.g., traffic and ship emissions, biomass burning, etc. Accurate classification of aerosol particles is essential to understand their sources and effects on human health. This letter investigates the application of SPMS and 1-D-convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) in aerosol particle classification. The proposed 1D-CNN achieved a mean classification accuracy of 90.4% with 13 particle classes. According to the experimental results, the combination of SPMS and 1D-CNN enables real-time collection, analysis, and classification of airborne aerosol particles to be used for highly responsive automated air quality monitoring.

Emission Factors of PAHs Components and Bioreactivity in PM2.5 from Biomass Burning,"Biomass burning releases fine particulate matter (PM2.5), water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIs), metal elements, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other compounds, and it is one of the largest sources of carbonaceous aerosols. The lungs experience negative health impacts from exposure to PM2.5; however, it is uncertain how PM2.5 emitted from biomass burning affect the human lung alveolar epithelium. This study investigated emission factors of PM2.5 from biomass burning and PM2.5 bioreactivity in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells. Emission factors were measured from biomass samples included maize straw (MS), wheat straw (WS), wood branches (WBs), MS briquettes (MSBs), MSB charcoal (MSC), WS briquettes (WSBs), WSB charcoal (WSC), WB briquettes (WBBs), and WBB charcoal (WBC). A549 cells were exposed to biomass PM2.5 at 0 and 50 Âµg mLâ€“1 for 24 h, and the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP), phosphorylated (p)-YAP, transcription coactivator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), p-TAZ, E-cadherin, and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) proteins were assessed by Western blotting. We found that MSC, WSC, WSBs, and WBs had higher PM2.5 emission factors. MS has the highest emission factors of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among all the biomass PM2.5, especially FLU (26.46 mg kgâ€“1) and PYR (26.93 mg kgâ€“1). There were 48.30% of PM2.5 was able to deposit in the alveolar area with a concentration of 32.25 Âµg mâ€“3 estimated by a multiple-path particle dosimetry (MPPD) model. We observed decreases in p-YAP/YAP and HMGB1 expressions after biomass PM2.5 exposure. YAP were positively correlated with ANT, PHE, 1-MP, FLU, PYR, 3,6-DP, BaA, CHR, BbF, BkF, BaP, BeP, PER, IcdP, BghiP, and DahA (p < 0.05). In conclusion, PAHs in biomass PM2.5 contribute to cytotoxicity on A549 cells. PAHs in PM2.5 with high emission factors from biomass burning could cause significant human pulmonary deteritious health effects after inhalation. Â© 2024, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

Effect of industrialization on the differences in sources and composition of ambient PM2.5 in two Southern Ontario locations,"PM2.5 was sampled over a seven-year period (2013â€“2019) at two locations âˆ¼50 km apart in Southern Ontario (concurrently for five years: 2015â€“2019). One is a heavily industrialized site (Hamilton), while the other was a rural site (Simcoe). To assess the impact of industrialization on the composition and sources of PM affecting air quality in these two locations, positive matrix factorization coupled with dispersion normalization (DN-PMF) was used to identify six and eight factors at Simcoe and Hamilton, respectively. The Simcoe factors in order of diminishing PM mass contribution were: particulate sulphate (pSO4), secondary organic aerosol (SOA), crustal matter, particulate nitrate (pNO3), biomass burning, and vehicular emissions. At Hamilton, the effects of industrialization were observed by the âˆ¼36% higher average ambient PM2.5 concentration for the study period as well as the presence of factors unique to metallurgy, i.e., coking and steelmaking, compared to Simcoe. The coking and steelmaking factors contributed âˆ¼15% to the PM mass at Hamilton. Seasonal variants of appropriate nonparametric trend tests with the associated slopes (Sen's) were used to assess statistically significant changes in the factor contributions to PM2.5 over time. Specifically at Hamilton, a significant decline in PM contributions was noted for coking (âˆ’0.03 Î¼g/mÂ³/yr or âˆ’4.1%/yr) while steelmaking showed no statistically significant decline over the study period. Other factors at Hamilton that showed statistically significant declines over the study period were: pSO4 (âˆ’0.27 Î¼g/mÂ³/yr or âˆ’12.6%/yr), biomass burning (âˆ’0.05 Î¼g/mÂ³/yr or âˆ’9.02%/yr), crustal matter (âˆ’0.03 Î¼g/mÂ³/yr or âˆ’5.28%/yr). These factors mainly accounted for the significant decline in PM2.5 over the study period (âˆ’0.35 Î¼g/mÂ³/yr or âˆ’4.24%/yr). This work shows the importance of long-term monitoring in assessing the unique contributions and temporal changes of industrialization on air quality in Ontario and similarly affected locations.

"Analysis of PM2.5 inorganic and organic constituents to resolve contributing sources in Seoul, South Korea and Beijing, China and their possible associations with cytokine IL-8","China and South Korea are the most polluted countries in East Asia due to significant urbanization and extensive industrial activities. As neighboring countries, collaborative management plans to maximize public health in both countries can be helpful in reducing transboundary air pollution. To support such planning, PM2.5 inorganic and organic species were determined in simultaneously collected PM2.5 integrated filters. The resulting data were used as inputs to positive matrix factorization, which identified nine sources at the ambient air monitoring sites in both sites. Secondary nitrate, secondary sulfate/oil combustion, soil, mobile, incinerator, biomass burning, and secondary organic carbon (SOC) were found to be sources at both sampling sites. Industry I and II were only identified in Seoul, whereas combustion and road dust sources were only identified in Beijing. A subset of samples was selected for exposure assessment. The expression levels of IL-8 were significantly higher in Beijing (167.7 pg/mL) than in Seoul (72.7 pg/mL). The associations between the PM2.5 chemical constituents and its contributing sources with PM2.5-induced inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-8, IL-8) levels in human bronchial epithelial cells were investigated. For Seoul, the soil followed by the secondary nitrate and the biomass burning showed increase with IL-8 production. However, for the Beijing, the secondary nitrate exhibited the highest association with IL-8 production and SOC and biomass burning showed modest increase with IL-8. As one of the highest contributing sources in both cities, secondary nitrate showed an association with IL-8 production. The soil source having the strongest association with IL-8 production was found only for Seoul, whereas SOC showed a modest association only for Beijing. This study can provide the scientific basis for identifying the sources to be prioritized for control to provide effective mitigation of particulate air pollution in each city and thereby improve public health.

A hybrid model to improve WRF-Chem performance for crop burning emissions of PM2.5 and secondary aerosols in North India,"In north India (about 30,000 km2 area), Octoberâ€“November months witness crop residue burning (CRB). This study aims to assess the impact of CRB emissions on PM2.5 and secondary aerosol (SA) at distances far from the sources. Chemical transport model, WRF-Chem (with chemical mechanisms, RADM2 and MADE/SORGAM), was applied to a domain of 840 Ã— 840 km2 (centered around Delhi) with inputs of emissions of anthropogenic sources of EDGAR-HTAP and fire inventory from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research, USA. In parallel, measurements of PM2.5 and its constituents, CO, and NO2 were undertaken in Delhi and Kanpur. The model underestimated PM2.5 and showed poor predictions (r < 0.15) with insignificant formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (< 1% in PM2.5). To improve the model, a linear regression-based hybrid model (HM) was developed that utilized the mechanistic processes of WRF-Chem and observed levels of PM2.5, CO and NO2. The HM performed adequately at multiple sites in Delhi (r = 0.19â€“0.47) and Kanpur (r = 0.38â€“0.43). The contribution of CRB to PM2.5 was at 31 Â± 16% (in 232 Â± 36 Î¼g/m3) in Delhi and 21 Â± 15% (in 233 Â± 38 Î¼g/m3) in Kanpur. The contribution of SOA in CRB-contributed PM2.5 was 18 Â± 9% (Delhi) and 29 Â± 21% (Kanpur). Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",
Aerosol classification using fuzzy clustering over a tropical rural site,"Exact knowledge on the types of aerosols present over a region is very important in the radiative forcing estimates. Several techniques are available to classify aerosols, which have their own pros and cons. In the present study, a soft clustering technique, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is employed to classify aerosols using multiple aerosol parameters over a rural site Gadanki (13.48oN, 79.18Â°E), India. The optical and microphysical properties of the aerosols (26 parameters) derived from long-term measurements of the Sky Radiometer (from April 2008 to October 2020) are utilized for cluster analysis. The three resultant clusters were found to be distinct and compact based on high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity. By comparing the clustering results of different subsets of data and testing the robustness of the FCM algorithm, we found that the correct classification percentage for each scenario was about 98.4%. Even by introducing a 10% random error for each of the aerosol microphysical properties used in the cluster analysis, around 94.5% of the records were found to retain the original clusters. Based on the aerosol properties of the clusters, the three clusters were identified as mixed mode moderately absorbing, mixed mode slightly absorbing, and coarse mode slightly absorbing type of aerosols. While comparing with the global aerosol models, these three aerosol types showed similarities with biomass burning, polluted marine, and polluted continental aerosol types. Significant seasonal variability of the identified aerosol types was observed, with biomass burning type dominating in the pre-monsoon season, polluted marine during the monsoon season, and polluted continental in a relatively higher percentage compared to the other two types in winter and post-monsoon seasons. An increasing trend in polluted marine aerosol type is noticed, whilst biomass burning and polluted continental showed decreasing trends. Furthermore, the existing knowledge on various aspects of aerosols over Gadanki ascertains that the identified aerosol types are reasonable, implying that the FCM clustering technique for aerosol classification is effective and it might be extend to other locations.

A global evaluation of daily to seasonal aerosol and water vapor relationships using a combination of AERONET and NAAPS reanalysis data,"The co-transport of aerosol particles and water vapor has long been noted in the literature, with a myriad of implications such as air mass characterization, radiative transfer, and data assimilation. Here, the relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PW) is evaluated to our knowledge for the first time globally, at daily to seasonal levels using approximately 20 years of NASA Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observational data and the 16-year Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System (NAAPS) reanalysis v1.0 (NAAPS-RA) model fields. The combination of AERONET observations with small uncertainties and the reanalysis fields with global coverage is used to provide a best estimate of the seasonal AOD and PW relationships, including an evaluation of correlations, slope, and PW probability distributions for identification of statistically significant differences in PW for high-AOD events. The relationships produced from the AERONET and NAAPS-RA datasets were compared against each other and showed consistency, indicating that the NAAPS-RA provides a realistic representation of the AOD and PW relationship. The analysis includes layer AOD and PW relationships for proxies of the planetary boundary layer and the lower, middle, and upper free troposphere. The dominant AOD and PW relationship is positive, supported by both AERONET and model evaluation, which varies in strength by season and location. These relationships were found to be statistically significant and present across the globe, observed on an event-by-event level. Evaluations at individual AERONET sites implicate synoptic-scale transport as a contributing factor in these relationships at daily levels. Negative AOD and PW relationships were identified and predominantly associated with regional dry-season timescales in which biomass burning is the predominant aerosol type. This is not an indication of dry-air association with smoke for an individual event but is a reflection of the overall dry conditions leading to more biomass burning and higher associated AOD values. Stronger correlations between AOD and PW are found when evaluating the data by vertical layers, including the boundary layer and the lower, middle, and upper free troposphere (corresponding to typical water vapor channels), with the largest correlations observed in the free troposphere - indicative of aerosol and water vapor transport events. By evaluating the variability between PW and relative humidity in the NAAPS-RA, hygroscopic growth was found to be a dominant term to (1) amplify positive AOD-PW relationships, particularly in the midlatitudes; (2) diminish negative relationships in dominant biomass burning regions; and (3) lead to statistically insignificant changes in PW for high-AOD events for maritime regions. The importance of hygroscopic growth in these relationships indicates that PW is a useful tracer for AOD or light extinction but not necessarily as strongly for aerosol mass. Synoptic-scale African dust events are an exception where PW is a strong tracer for aerosol transport shown by strong relationships even with hygroscopic effects. Given these results, PW can be exploited in coupled aerosol and meteorology data assimilation for AOD, and the collocation of aerosol and water vapor should be carefully taken into account when conducting particulate matter (PM) retrievals from space and in evaluating radiative impacts of aerosol, with the season and location in mind.

Study of aerosol optical properties at two urban areas in the north of Vietnam with the implication for biomass burning impacts,"The spatiotemporal distribution and characterization of aerosol optical properties in the north of Vietnam were investigated extensively using the long-term measurements obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (from 2010 to 2019) and two Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations (Nghia Do, Hanoi City, from 2010 to 2019 and Son La from 2012 to 2019) located in fast-developing urban areas. This study also analyzed the tendency of AOD over different wavelengths as well as the influences of meteorological parameters and boundary layer height (BLH) on AOD and Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (AE). The annual mean AOD500 at Nghia Do and Son La stations were 0.81 and 0.78, respectively. Our results revealed the existence of particles emitted from anthropogenic activities in Hanoi and Son La with the dominance of fine particles (more than 90% of the AE440â€“870 were larger than 1). Besides, a high percentage of AE440â€“870 larger than or approximately 1.5 during the dry and transition months in Son La indicated the existence of biomass-burning aerosol particles due to forest fires and burning of agriculture residuals. The classification results for aerosol types showed the presence of both biomass burning and urban/industrial aerosol types at Nghia Do and Son La sites. Among the investigated meteorological parameters, surface solar radiation expressed a significant correlation with AE440â€“870 in all three seasons at the two sites due to the secondary formation of fine particles induced by the high solar radiation condition. The impacts of meteorological parameters and BLH on AOD were not observed simultaneously during three seasons at Nghia Do and Son La stations.

Classification and transformation of aerosols over selected Indian cities during reduced emissions under Covid-19 lockdown,"Abstract: Studies in the recent past show improved air quality over India during the Covid-19 lockdown. This research attempts to characterize atmospheric aerosols in terms of Î± and AOD and their transformation over India during the pandemic lockdown. The type and particle distribution of aerosols, including gaseous species for five Indian regions were considered. Fine to coarse particle shift was observed in most regions. The northern region observed high fire counts, implying crop residue burning season during the stringent lockdown. Thiruvananthapuram, in the south, showed an increase in PM, owing to the resumption of mobility post-lockdown. Hyderabad, however; observed increased PM2.5 (2.79%) and AOD (37.23%) during Phase 1. Maritime (MT) aerosol predominated over Thiruvananthapuram, whereas urban/biomass burning (UBB) type decreased over the eastern region. Contributions from continental average (CA), maritime continental average (MCA), and MT were observed over Hyderabad, post-lockdown. In the central region, MCA was replaced by UBB and mixed type, with isolated episodes of clean continental (CC) and desert dust (DD). During lockdown phases, an increase in O3 over western, northern, and central regions is attributed to increased temperature and decreased NO2. A significant correlation with population density (PD) exists with NO2 (R2 = 0.75; p < 0.05), suggesting human mobility as a major contributor to NO2 in the atmosphere during the lockdown period. Highlights: Characterization of atmospheric aerosols during Covid-19 lockdown over India.General shift from fine to coarse particles size in most regions.Crop residue burning increased pollutants in North during lockdown.Forest fire season in central and south-central region increased PM, NO2 concentrations during lockdown.Maritime origin aerosols dominate over Thiruvananthapuram.Decline in pollutants in post-lockdown due to meteorology (early monsoon, cyclone Amphan, and Nisarga).

Aerosols over the Foothills of the Eastern Himalayan Region during Post-monsoon and Winter Seasons,"In this study a Microtops II sunphotometer is used for the first time over Birtamode, a rapidly growing city located in the eastern Himalayan foothills of Nepal, to measure aerosol optical depth (AOD). The average AOD for the observation period (October 2018â€“February 2019) was 0.68 Â± 0.39 with the post-monsoon season having a higher value (0.74 Â± 0.43) compared to the winter season (0.60 Â± 0.32). The Angstrom exponent (Î±) for post-monsoon and winter are found to be 1.08 Â± 0.10 and 1.11 Â± 0.16 respectively. During the monitoring period, the majority of AOD values (47%) are above 0.60, indicating moderately polluted conditions in the region. Anthropogenic, biomass burning, and mixed aerosols are identified as the prevalent aerosol types in the study region. The observed aerosol classification is also explained in terms of CAMS near-real-time model datasets. The AOD values retrieved by MODIS, VIIRS, Himawari-8, and CAMS show a good correlation with the observed Microtops AOD with R2 values ranging from 0.60 to 0.94. Moreover, different MODIS aerosol products (DB, DT, and combined DB-DT) are evaluated based on a comparison of Collection 6.1 AOD with the ground truth obtained from Microtops. The spatial distribution of AOD as observed by various satellites are compared and the vertical distribution of aerosol is also explained with the extinction coefficient provided by the CALIOP lidar onboard CALIPSO and aerosol types provided by CAMS.

A Study of Erythrocyte Deformation Level Related to Biomass Burning Emission Exposures Using Artificial Neural Networks,"Emissions from burning biomass have become a problem in Indonesia. As found on the Indonesian island of Lombok, agricultural waste is burned for traditional industrial activities. On the other hand, biomass burning emissions contain many PMs (particulates) in different size distributions recognized to have a significant correlation to health impact. This study is conducted to predict the impact of the PM exposure on blood using a ANN (artificial neural network) model as well as a histological examination. The relationship between both methods is determined to estimate the impact of biomass burning emissions on the blood. This study used male mice as the experimental animals exposed to PM emissions (PM0.1, PM2.5, and PM10) produced from the burning of various biomass (rice straw, rice husks, corn cobs, corn stalks, and tobacco) taken from Lombok Island. The sample exposure was conducted in a chamber for 100 s for ten sequence days. The blood samples were observed using a microscope with the 400 x magnification. The cell deformation was examined histologically by calculating the normal and abnormal cells. The percentage of the erythrocyte deformation was assessed using a fixed back and forth propagation ANN. The result shows that the biomass burning PM emissions have a significant impact on the erythrocyte deformation depending on the type of biomass and the particulate matter emissions. The ANN model confirms the erythrocyte deformation data obtained by the histological examination method. Â© 2022, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved.",
Associations between long-term exposures to airborne PM2.5 components and mortality in Massachusetts: mixture analysis exploration,"Background:: Numerous studies have documented PM2.5â€™s links with adverse health outcomes. Comparatively fewer studies have evaluated specific PM2.5 components. The lack of exposure measurements and high correlation among different PM2.5 components are two limitations. Methods:: We applied a novel exposure prediction model to obtain annual Census tract-level concentrations of 15 PM2.5 components (Zn, V, Si, Pb, Ni, K, Fe, Cu, Ca, Br, SO42âˆ’, NO3âˆ’, NH4+, OC, EC) in Massachusetts from 2000 to 2015, to which we matched geocoded deaths. All non-accidental mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and respiratory mortality were examined for the population aged 18 or over. Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression models were used to examine the cumulative associations between PM2.5 components mixture and outcomes and each componentâ€™s contributions to the cumulative associations. We have fit WQS models on 15 PM2.5 components and a priori identified source groups (heavy fuel oil combustion, biomass burning, crustal matter, non-tailpipe traffic source, tailpipe traffic source, secondary particles from power plants, secondary particles from agriculture, unclear source) for the 15 PM2.5 components. Total PM2.5 mass analysis and single component associations were also conducted through quasi-Poisson regression models. Results:: Positive cumulative associations between the components mixture and all three outcomes were observed from the WQS models. Components with large contribution to the cumulative associations included K, OC, and Fe. Biomass burning, traffic emissions, and secondary particles from power plants were identified as important source contributing to the cumulative associations. Mortality rate ratios for cardiovascular mortality were of greater magnitude than all non-accidental mortality and respiratory mortality, which is also observed in cumulative associations estimated from WQS, total PM2.5 mass analysis, and single component associations. Conclusion:: We have found positive associations between the mixture of 15 PM2.5 components and all non-accidental mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and respiratory mortality. Among these components, Fe, K, and OC have been identified as having important contribution to the cumulative associations. The WQS results also suggests potential source effects from biomass burning, traffic emissions, and secondary particles from power plants. Â© 2022, The Author(s).",
Characterization of the lung microbiome and inflammatory cytokine levels in women exposed to environmental risk factors: A pilot study,"Introduction: Lung microbiome dysbiosis affects the immune system balance and promotes lung inflammation. We aimed to characterize and compare the lung bacteriome composition and the cytokine profile in women with normal lung function exposed to risk factors for chronic lung diseases (tobacco smoking and biomass-burning smoke exposure). Methods: We included women with biomass-burning smoke exposure (BE, n = 11) and current smokers women (TS, n = 10). The bacteriome composition was performed in induced sputum, sequencing the 16 rRNA gene. Cytokine levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay multiplex assay in the supernatant of induced sputum. For quantitative variables, we used medians and minimum and maxim values. For the amplicon sequence variants (ASV) differential abundance testing between groups. Results: At the taxa level, the phylum Proteobacteria was found in a higher proportion in the TS group concerning BE (p =.045); however, after the false discovery rate adjustment, this difference was not retained (p =.288). We found a higher concentration of IL-1Î² in the TS group than in the BE group (248.6 vs. 177.9 pg/mL, p =.010). Women with high biomass-burning smoke exposure in an hour per day had a positive correlation with the abundance of Bacteroidota (Ï = 0.71, p =.014) and Fusobacteriota (Ï = 0.73, p =.011). FEV1/FVC had a positive correlation with an abundance of Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria (Ï = 0.74, p =.009, Ï = 0.85, p =.001, and Ï = 0.83, p =.001, respectively). In tobacco smoking, women had a positive correlation (Ï = 0.77, p =.009) between cigarettes per day and Firmicutes' abundance. Conclusion: Compared to biomass-burning smoke-exposed women, current smokers have poor lung function and high levels of IL-1Î² in sputum. Women with biomass-burning smoke exposure present an increased abundance of Bacteroidota and Fusobacteriota. Â© 2023 The Authors.

Seasonal cycles and long-term trends of arctic tropospheric aerosols based on CALIPSO lidar observations,"Notable warming trends have been observed in the Arctic, with tropospheric aerosols being one of the key drivers. Here the seasonal cycles of three-dimensional (3D) distributions of aerosol extinction coefficients (AECs) and frequency of occurrences (FoOs) for different aerosol subtypes in the troposphere over the Arctic from 2007 to 2019 are characterized capitalizing on Cloudâ€“Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) Level-3 gridded aerosol profile product. Seasonal contributions of total and type-dependent aerosols through their partitioning within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free troposphere (FT) are also quantified utilizing the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) PBL height data. The results show substantial seasonal and geographical dependence in the distribution of aerosols over the Arctic. Sulfate, black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) contribute most of the total AEC, with Eurasia being the largest contributor. The vertical structure of AECs and FoOs over the Arctic demonstrates that the vertical influence of aerosols is higher in eastern Siberia and North America than in northern Eurasia and its coasts. When the total aerosol optical depth (TAOD) is partitioned into the PBL and FT, results indicate that the contributions of TAOD within the FT tend to be more significant, especially in summer, with the FT contributes 64.2% and 69.2% of TAOD over the lower (i.e., 60Â° Nâ€“70Â° N) and high (i.e., north of 70Â° N) Arctic, respectively. Additionally, seasonal trend analyses suggest Arctic TAOD exhibits a multi-year negative trend in winter, spring, and autumn and a positive trend in summer during 2007â€“2019, due to an overall decrease in sulfate from weakened anthropogenic emissions and a significant increase in BC and OC from enhanced biomass burning activities. Overall, this study has potential implications for understanding the seasonal cycles and trends in Arctic aerosols. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.",
Sensitivity of biomass burning emissions estimates to land surface information,"Emissions from biomass burning (BB) are a key source of atmospheric tracer gases that affect the atmospheric carbon cycle. We developed four sets of global BB emissions estimates (named GlcGlob, GlcGeoc, McdGlob, and McdGeoc) using a bottom-up approach and by combining the remote sensing products related to fire distribution with two aboveground biomass (AGB) and two land cover classification (LCC) distributions. The sensitivity of the estimates of BB emissions to the AGB and LCC data was evaluated using the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions associated with each BB estimate. Using the AGB and/or LCC data led to substantially different spatial estimates of CO emissions, with a large (factor of approximately 3) spread of estimates for the mean annual CO emissions: 526Â±53, 219Â±35, 624Â±57, and 293Â±44gTggCOgyr-1 for GlcGlob, GlcGeoc, McdGlob, and McdGeoc, respectively, and 415Â±47gTggCOgyr-1 for their ensemble average (EsmAve). We simulated atmospheric CO variability at an approximately 2.5g grid using an atmospheric tracer transport model and the BB emissions estimates and compared it with ground-based and satellite observations. At ground-based observation sites during fire seasons, the impact of intermittent fire events was poorly defined in our simulations due to the coarse resolution, which obscured temporal and spatial variability in the simulated atmospheric CO concentration. However, when compared at the regional and global scales, the distribution of atmospheric CO concentrations in the simulations shows substantial differences among the estimates of BB emissions. These results indicate that the estimates of BB emissions are highly sensitive to the AGB and LCC data. Â© 2022 Makoto Saito et al.",
High-Altitude Air Pollutants Monitored from Rainwater Chemistry in the Central Himalaya,"Based on the ion chromatography method, the chemical characterization of rainwater (RW) samples collected over Srinagar (a location in central Himalaya) has been done during monsoon 2016 (MON-2016). The rainwater shows near acidic pH values ranging from 5.1 to 6.2 (average, 5.7 Â± 0.6) during the study. The average ionic concentrations of 97 Â± 10 Î¼eq/1 were reported during MON-2016. Ca2+ has significantly high contribution of 24% as compared to NH4+ (18%), Na+ (9%), K+ (4%), and Mg2+ (3%) among cations, whereas Clâˆ’, SO42âˆ’, and NO3âˆ’ have contribution of ~ 15, 11, and 7%, respectively, among anions during chemical analysis. We have reported SO42âˆ’/NO3âˆ’ ratio as 1.49, which shows contribution of 60 and 40% from SO42âˆ’ and NO3âˆ’ ions within the predicted limit of RW (H2SO4, 60â€“70%, and HNO3, 30â€“40%). Ca2+, Mg2+, and NH4+ have neutralization factors as 2.51, 0.37, and 2.01, respectively, due to the neutralization of acidic species in RW. The non-sea salt (NSS) contribution to total Ca2+, K+, and Mg2+ indicates the major contribution from crustal origin, whereas the NSS contribution to the total Clâˆ’ and SO42âˆ’ was from the anthropogenic source. The principle component analysis (PCA) indicates that the first factor (i.e., natural sources, mainly dust and sea salts) has only ~ 9% variance. In contrast, the second factor (i.e., fossil fuel and biomass burning) has ~ 17% variance, and the third factor has 27% variance may be due to soil, agricultural, and biomass burning origin. The rest of the contributions are from mixed emission sources as well as by the transport of polluted air mass from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and Punjab Rajasthan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. This manuscript helps to understand the impact of crustal and anthropogenic sources in rainwater over the central Himalaya region of Uttarakhand.

"Factors influencing ambient particulate matter in Delhi, India: Insights from machine learning","Concentrations of ambient particulate matter (PM) depend on various factors including emissions of primary pollutants, meteorology and chemical transformations. New Delhi, India is the most polluted megacity in the world and routinely experiences extreme pollution episodes. As part of the Delhi Aerosol Supersite study, we measured online continuous PM1 (particulate matter of size less than 1 Î¼m) concentrations and composition for over five years starting January 2017, using an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM). Here, we describe the development and application of machine learning models using random forest regression to estimate the concentrations, composition, sources and dynamics of PM in Delhi. These models estimate PM1 species concentrations based on meteorological parameters including ambient temperature, relative humidity, planetary boundary layer height, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, agricultural burning fire counts, solar radiation and cloud cover. We used hour of day, day of week and month of year as proxies for time-dependent emissions (e.g., emissions from traffic during rush hours). We demonstrate the applicability of these models to capture temporal variability of the PM1 species, to understand the influence of individual factors via sensitivity analyses, and to separate impacts of the COVID-19 lockdowns and associated activity restrictions from impacts of other factors. Our models provide new insights into the factors influencing ambient PM1 in New Delhi, India, demonstrating the power of machine learning models in atmospheric science applications.

Influence of longitudinal wind on mass burning rate of rectangular heptane pool fire with different aspect ratios,"Fire is one of the primary disasters that threaten the safe operation of tunnel and underground space. Mass burning rate is a significant parameter in characterizing the behavior of pool fire which is related to thermal feedback, pool shape and ambient wind. Five convection-controlled heptane pool fires are examined inside a longitudinal wind tunnel with aspect ratio of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. The variation of burning rate with longitudinal wind is divided into increasing regime at v < 0.96 m/s, decreasing regime at 0.96 â‰¤ v < 1.98 m/s, and slightly-fluctuating regime at 1.98 â‰¤ v < 2.49 m/s. The effect of longitudinal wind on burning rate is attributed to heat feedback, flow disturbance and oxidizer supply around the flame. The increment of burning rate with wind speed is proved by the liquid evaporation theory. The heat transfer analysis proves that the enlargement rate of burning rate is linearly proportional to a coupling factor of longitudinal air flow speed and aspect ratio in a unified mathematical correlation [Formula presented] which is fully consistent with measurements. The results provide guidance for tunnel fire protection design and prediction of fire development under the condition of vehicle tank leakage inside a tunnel. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd",
Classification of MODIS fire emission data based on aerosol absorption Angstrom exponent retrieved from AERONET data,"Biomass burning emits a large quantity of gaseous pollutants and aerosols into the atmosphere, which perturbs the regional and global climate and has significant impacts on air quality and human health. In order to understand the temporal and spatial distributions of biomass burning and its contribution to aerosol optical and radiative impacts, we examined fire emission data and its contribution to aerosol optical and radiative impacts over six major hot-spot continents/sub-continents across the globe, namely North-Central (NC) Africa, South America, US-Hawaii, South Asia, South East Asia, and Australia-New Zealand, using long-term satellites, ground-based and re-analysis data during 2000â€“2021. The selected six sites contributed âˆ¼70% of total global fire data. The classification of biomass burning, such as pre, active, and post burning phases, was performed based on the Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE) estimated from 55 AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) stations. The study found the highest contribution of fire count (55 %) during the active burning phase followed by post (36 %) and pre (8 %) burning phases. Such high fire counts were associated with high absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) during the active fire event. Strong dominance of fine and coarse mode mixed aerosols were also observed during active and post fire regimes. High AAOD and low Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE) over NC Africa during the fire events suggested presence of mineral dust mixed with biomass burning aerosols. Brightness temperature, fire radiative power and fire count were also dominated by the active burning followed by post and pre burning phases. The maximum heating rate of 3.15 K dayâˆ’1 was observed during the active fire events. The heating rate profile shows clear variations for three different fire regimes with the highest value of 1.80 K dayâˆ’1 at âˆ¼750 hPa altitude during the active fire event. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",
Improving the Combustion Factor to Estimate GHG Emissions Associated with Fire in Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp. Plantations in Chile,"Forest plantations can substantially contribute to carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation at the country and global scales. Forest fires (especially when combined with droughts) may remarkably reduce such carbon sequestration capability. The IPCC has global-scale estimates for such losses, but they can vary widely depending on crops, climate, topography, and management, among other factors. The IPCC defines a factor for biomass loss as a consequence of forest fires, expressed as a fraction of total biomass. This methodology implies using aggregated data and the default emission factor, which are only recommended for countries where wildfires are not a key category. In Chile, over the last decade, there have been between 5000 and 8000 wildfires annually (an average of 6398 for the period 2011â€“2020), burning an average of 122,328 hectares each year. Countries may progress in the refinement of such factors depending on the availability and reliability of local values. This paper aims at estimating (Formula presented.) values for the main forest plantation species in Chile, Pinus radiata, Eucalyptus nitens, and Eucalyptus globulus, across different age-classes and forest fire severity. To achieve this aim, we assessed the biomass loss after forest fires for a stratified sample of forest plots for the season 2018â€“2019. We fitted a model to predict the amount of biomass loss during fires, and in this way, predict the emissions associated with wildfires. The model employs very simple predictive variables, age and species, because statistics for burnt areas in plantations are only provided by age-classes and species, without details about productivity or management.

AEROsol generic classification using a novel Satellite remote sensing Approach (AEROSA),"Numerous studies (hereafter GA: general approach studies) have been made to classify aerosols into desert dust (DD), biomass-burning (BB), clean continental (CC), and clean maritime (CM) types using only aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (AE). However, AOD represents the amount of aerosol suspended in the atmospheric column while the AE is a qualitative indicator of the size distribution of the aerosol estimated using AOD measurements at different wavelengths. Therefore, these two parameters do not provide sufficient information to unambiguously classify aerosols into these four types. Evaluation of the performance of GA classification applied to AErosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) data, at sites for situations with known aerosol types, provides many examples where the GA method does not provide correct results. For example, a thin layer of haze was classified as BB and DD outside the crop burning and dusty seasons respectively, a thick layer of haze was classified as BB, and aerosols from known crop residue burning events were classified as DD, CC, and CM by the GA method. The results also show that the classification varies with the season, for example, the same range of AOD and AE were observed during a dust event in the spring (20th March 2012) and a smog event in the autumn (2nd November 2017). The results suggest that only AOD and AE cannot precisely classify the exact nature (i.e., DD, BB, CC, and CM) of aerosol types without incorporating more optical and physical properties. An alternative approach, AEROsol generic classification using a novel Satellite remote sensing Approach (AEROSA), is proposed to provide aerosol amount and size information using AOD and AE, respectively, from the Terra-MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Collection 6.1 Level 2 combined Dark Target and Deep Blue (DTB) product and AERONET Version 3 Level 2.0 data. Although AEROSA is also based on AOD and AE, it does not claim the nature of aerosol types, instead providing information on aerosol amount and size. The purpose is to introduce AEROSA for those researchers who are interested in the generic classification of aerosols based on AOD and AE, without claiming the exact aerosol types such as DD, BB, CC, and CM. AEROSA not only provides 9 generic aerosol classes for all observations but can also accommodate variations in location and season, which GA aerosol types do not.

Identifying chemical aerosol signatures using optical suborbital observations: How much can optical properties tell us about aerosol composition?,"Improvements in air quality and Earth's climate predictions require improvements of the aerosol speciation in chemical transport models, using observational constraints. Aerosol speciation (e.g., organic aerosols, black carbon, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, dust or sea salt) is typically determined using in situ instrumentation. Continuous, routine aerosol composition measurements from ground-based networks are not uniformly widespread over the globe. Satellites, on the other hand, can provide a maximum coverage of the horizontal and vertical atmosphere but observe aerosol optical properties (and not aerosol speciation) based on remote sensing instrumentation. Combinations of satellite-derived aerosol optical properties can inform on air mass aerosol types (AMTs). However, these AMTs are subjectively defined, might often be misclassified and are hard to relate to the critical parameters that need to be refined in models. In this paper, we derive AMTs that are more directly related to sources and hence to speciation. They are defined, characterized and derived using simultaneous in situ gas-phase, chemical and optical instruments on the same aircraft during the Study of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS, an airborne field campaign carried out over the US during the summer of 2013). We find distinct optical signatures for AMTs such as biomass burning (from agricultural or wildfires), biogenic and polluted dust. We find that all four AMTs, studied when prescribed using mostly airborne in situ gas measurements, can be successfully extracted from a few combinations of airborne in situ aerosol optical properties (e.g., extinction Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent, absorption Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent and real refractive index). However, we find that the optically based classifications for biomass burning from agricultural fires and polluted dust include a large percentage of misclassifications that limit the usefulness of results related to those classes. The technique and results presented in this study are suitable to develop a representative, robust and diverse source-based AMT database. This database could then be used for widespread retrievals of AMTs using existing and future remote sensing suborbital instruments/networks. Ultimately, it has the potential to provide a much broader observational aerosol dataset to evaluate chemical transport and air quality models than is currently available by direct in situ measurements. This study illustrates how essential it is to explore existing airborne datasets to bridge chemical and optical signatures of different AMTs, before the implementation of future spaceborne missions (e.g., the next generation of Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites addressing Aerosols, Cloud, Convection and Precipitation (ACCP) designated observables).

Identification of aerosol types over the central Indo-Gangetic Plain using multi-satellite observations,"Identification and quantification of aerosol types in the central Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region is done using long-term (2005 - 2019) and simultaneous datasets, from satellite and reanalysis, of aerosol optical depth (AOD), absorbing aerosol index (AAI) and Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (Î±). In order to identify aerosol types in the central IGP, we used two classification methods by assigning the predefined thresholds of (i) AOD and Î± and (ii) AOD, a and AAI. Results derived from Method 1 suggest anthropogenic aerosols (AA) are dominant during the study period followed by mixed type (MT) and biomass burning (BB) aerosols over Gorakhpur. From Method 2, it is apparent that absorbing aerosols dominate during pre-monsoon (PM), post-monsoon (PoM) and winter (W) seasons, and non-absorbing aerosols during monsoon (M). BB aerosols derived from method 1 and carbonaceous aerosols from method 2 showed the highest contribution during PoM and W season. This is due to increased burning of agricultural waste and forest fires in the IGP region during this period. Dust aerosols derived from both methods showed maximum contribution during PM season, with marginal contributions during M and W seasons, respectively, and negligible during PoM season.

Impact of various air mass types on cloud condensation nuclei concentrations along coastal southeast Florida,"Coastal southeast Florida experiences a wide range of aerosol conditions, including African dust, biomass burning (BB) aerosols, as well as sea salt and other locally-emitted aerosols. These aerosols are important sources of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which play an essential role in governing cloud radiative properties. As marine environments dominate the surface of Earth, CCN characteristics in coastal southeast Florida have broad implications for other regions with the added feature that this site is perturbed by both natural and anthropogenic emissions. This study investigates the influence of different air mass types on CCN concentrations at 0.2% (CCN0.2%) and 1.0% (CCN1.0%) supersaturation (SS) based on ground site measurements during selected months in 2013, 2017, and 2018. Average CCN0.2% and CCN1.0% concentrations were 373 Â± 200 cmâˆ’3 and 584 Â± 323 cmâˆ’3, respectively, for four selected days with minimal presence of African dust and BB (i.e., background days). CCN concentrations were not elevated on the four days with highest influence of African dust (289 Â± 104 cmâˆ’3 [0.2% SS] and 591 Â± 302 cmâˆ’3 [1.0% SS]), consistent with high dust mass concentrations comprised of coarse particles that are few in number. In contrast, CCN concentrations were substantially enhanced on the five days with the greatest impact from BB (1408 Â± 976 cmâˆ’3 [0.2% SS] and 3337 Â± 1252 cmâˆ’3 [1.0% SS]). Ratios of CCN0.2%:CCN1.0% were used to compare the hygroscopicity of the aerosols associated with African dust, BB, and background days. Average ratios were similar for days impacted by African dust and BB (0.54 Â± 0.17 and 0.55 Â± 0.17, respectively). A 29% higher average ratio was observed on background days (0.71 Â± 0.14), owing in part to a strong presence of sea salt and reduced presence of more hydrophobic species such as those of a carbonaceous or mineral-dust nature. Finally, periods of heavy rainfall were shown to effectively decrease both CCN0.2% and CCN1.0% concentrations. However, the rate varied at which such concentrations increased after the rain. This work contributes knowledge on the nucleating ability of African dust and BB in a marine environment after varying periods of atmospheric transport (days to weeks). The results can be used to understand the hygroscopicity of these air mass types, predict how they may influence cloud properties, and provide a valuable model constraint when predicting CCN concentrations in comparable situations.

High-resolution estimation of ambient sulfate concentration over Taiwan Island using a novel ensemble machine-learning model,"Heavy loadings of sulfate aerosol trigger haze formation and pose great damage to human health in Taiwan Island. Nevertheless, high-resolution spatiotemporal variation of ambient sulfate across Taiwan Island still remained unknown because of the scarce monitoring sites. Thus, we developed a novel ensemble model named extreme gradient boosting coupled with geographically and temporally weighted regression (XGBoost-GTWR) to predict the high-resolution sulfate concentration (0.05Â°) based on satellite data, assimilated meteorology, and the output of chemical transport models (CTMs). The result suggested that XGBoost-GTWR model outperformed other five models in predicting the sulfate concentration with the highest R2 value (R2 = 0.58) and the lowest relative mean square error (RMSE = 1.96 Î¼g/m3). Besides, the transferability of the XGBoost-GTWR model was also validated based on the ground-level sulfate data in 2019. The result suggested that the R2 value of the extrapolation equation (0.53) did not show notable decrease compared with the 10-fold cross-validation result (0.58), indicating that the model was robust to predict the sulfate concentration. The ambient sulfate concentration in Taiwan Island displayed featured spatial variation with the highest one in Southwest Taiwan and the lowest one in Northeast Taiwan, respectively. It was assumed that the higher anthropogenic emission combined with the adverse meteorological condition led to the higher sulfate level in the southwestern coastal region. The ambient sulfate concentration exhibited significantly seasonal variation with the highest value in spring (5.65 Â± 0.84 Î¼g/m3), followed by those in winter (5.45 Â± 1.25 Î¼g/m3) and autumn (4.60 Â± 0.80 Î¼g/m3), and the lowest one in summer (3.80 Â± 0.65 Î¼g/m3). The higher sulfate concentration in spring was mainly contributed by the dense biomass burning and scarce rainfall amount. The present study develops a novel model to capture the high-resolution sulfate map and provides basic data for effective regulations of air pollution and epidemiological studies.

"Roles of RH, aerosol pH and sources in concentrations of secondary inorganic aerosols, during different pollution periods","Secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA, including sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium) were found to be the most dominant aerosol components during haze period. Elucidating the driving factors during liquid-phase reaction formation process of SIA is a key step for understanding the origin of airborne particulate pollution. In this work, we used online instruments and collected hourly concentrations of ions, gases, meteorological parameters in a northern city of China. Source emissions were estimated by receptor model PMF/ME2 pulling run solution (Partial Target Transformation-PMF: PTT-PMF), and six sources were identified (dust, coal combustion, vehicle exhaust, secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate and biomass burning & SOC). pH values were calculated by ISORROPIA-II, with an average value of 4.68. The relationships between RH, pH, source behaviors and concentrations of SIA during different pollution episodes were discussed. Source emissions were found to influence pH and subsequently the SIA; high RH could result in high SIA because aerosol water content in atmosphere increases with RH, which is favorable for liquid-phase reactions. Finally, we employed statistical and machine learning (Random forest classification: RFC) methods to analysis importance of driving factors on SIA formation during different pollution episodes. Results showed precursors, wet conditions, atmospheric oxidation capacity and acidity favor formation of sulfate and nitrate at different pollution levels; changes of gaseous precursors, RH and temperature are more important to determine PM2.5 pollution classification (clean, slightly polluted, moderately polluted, heavily polluted episodes).

Dilution impacts on smoke aging: Evidence in Biomass Burning Observation Project (BBOP) data,"Biomass burning emits vapors and aerosols into the atmosphere that can rapidly evolve as smoke plumes travel downwind and dilute, affecting climate- and health-relevant properties of the smoke. To date, theory has been unable to explain observed variability in smoke evolution. Here, we use observational data from the Biomass Burning Observation Project (BBOP) field campaign and show that initial smoke organic aerosol mass concentrations can help predict changes in smoke aerosol aging markers, number concentration, and number mean diameter between 40-262 nm. Because initial field measurements of plumes are generally 10 min downwind, smaller plumes will have already undergone substantial dilution relative to larger plumes and have lower concentrations of smoke species at these observations closest to the fire. The extent to which dilution has occurred prior to the first observation is not a directly measurable quantity. We show that initial observed plume concentrations can serve as a rough indicator of the extent of dilution prior to the first measurement, which impacts photochemistry, aerosol evaporation, and coagulation. Cores of plumes have higher concentrations than edges. By segregating the observed plumes into cores and edges, we find evidence that particle aging, evaporation, and coagulation occurred before the first measurement. We further find that on the plume edges, the organic aerosol is more oxygenated, while a marker for primary biomass burning aerosol emissions has decreased in relative abundance compared to the plume cores. Finally, we attempt to decouple the roles of the initial concentrations and physical age since emission by performing multivariate linear regression of various aerosol properties (composition, size) on these two factors.

"A case study on the vertical distribution and characteristics of aerosols using ground-based raman lidar, satellite and model over Western India","Ahmedabad is an urban site in western region of India. Dust loading and its variability are very high over this semi-arid location. A state-of-the-art ground-based Raman lidar has been used for the study of day-to-day variability in vertical distribution of aerosol loading over Ahmedabad (23.02Â° N, 72.57Â° E) from 8 to 11 May 2018. We have done a comprehensive study about vertical profiles of aerosols across two wavelengths recorded simultaneously, namely, 355Â nm and 532Â nm, over this location. An interesting hump feature has been noted on 9 May at around 18Â h (Local Time), with an additional peak at 19Â h on 10 May. The loading over this region has more fine-mode aerosols than coarse-mode particles. Further, findings from ground-based lidar have been compared with MACC-II model simulations and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization on-board Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observational. Back-trajectory analysis showed majority of the influx came from middle-east, carrying mineral dust and traces of marine aerosols from Arabian Sea, except for 11 May, where low-level dust carrying trajectories and also coarser dust particles were not seen. This type of manifestation has also been observed while classifying aerosols over Ahmedabad using Lidar Depolarization Ratio and Lidar Ratio obtained from Raman Lidar. Fine mode aerosols have been characterized as industrial, vehicular and marine, while coarser as mineral dust and biomass burning. This study focuses on local variation and classification of aerosols based on size and type, which will further help in better estimation of radiative budget and other impacts of aerosols.

Assessing the emission sources and reduction potential of atmospheric ammonia at an urban site in Northeast China,"Atmospheric ammonium and ammonia have brought negative environmental impacts and adverse health effects. However, ammonia emissions are generally less regulated worldwide. This study analyzed ammonium pollution character, quantified the dominant ammonia emission sources, and assessed ammonia reduction potential in urban Harbin (China). The results showed that ammonium recorded low concentration in the non-heating season (1.34 Â± 1.57 Î¼g/m3), and recorded sharply increased concentration (6.50 Â± 7.02 Î¼g/m3) and relative abundance in the heating season. It was closely correlated with vehicle-related pollutants (CO) in non-heating season, while with biomass burning-related pollutants (K+, Clâˆ’) in the heating season. Bayesian Mixing Model emphasized the increasing contribution of biomass burning and decreasing contribution of fertilizer as the pollution levels escalate. The results from the thermodynamic equilibrium model showed that a 50%â€“60% ammonium decrease could bring marketable decrements of the aerosol pH, aerosol water content, ammonium nitrate concentration, and inorganic ion mass. The results of this study would provide scientific bases for ammonia emission reduction and haze pollution control in urban Harbin. Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.",
Molecular Dynamics and Light Absorption Properties of Atmospheric Dissolved Organic Matter,"The light-absorbing organic aerosol referred to as brown carbon (BrC) affects the global radiative balance. The linkages between its molecular composition and light absorption properties and how environmental factors influence BrC composition are not well understood. In this study, atmospheric dissolved organic matter (ADOM) in 55 aerosol samples from Guangzhou was characterized using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and light absorption measurements. The abundant components in ADOM were aliphatics and peptide-likes (in structure), or nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds (in elemental composition). The light absorption properties of ADOM were positively correlated with the levels of unsaturated and aromatic structures. Particularly, 17 nitrogen-containing species, which are identified by a random forest, characterized the variation of BrC absorption well. Aggregated boosted tree model and nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis show that the BrC composition was largely driven by meteorological conditions and anthropogenic activities, among which biomass burning (BB) and OH radical were the two important factors. BrC compounds often accumulate with elevated BB emissions and related secondary processes, whereas the photolysis/photooxidation of BrC usually occurs under high solar radiance/â€¢OH concentration. This study first illuminated how environmental factors influence BrC at the molecular level and provided clues for the molecular-level research of BrC in the future.

Simulation of the evolution of biomass burning organic aerosol with different volatility basis set schemes in PMCAMx-SRv1.0,"A source-resolved three-dimensional chemical transport model, PMCAMx-SR (Particulate Matter Comprehensive Air-quality Model with extensions - Source Resolved), was applied in the continental US to investigate the contribution of the various components (primary and secondary) of biomass burning organic aerosol (bbOA) to organic aerosol levels. Two different schemes based on the volatility basis set were used for the simulation of the bbOA during different seasons. The first is the default scheme of PMCAMx-SR, and the second is a recently developed scheme based on laboratory experiments of the bbOA evolution./ The simulations with the alternative bbOA scheme predict much higher total bbOA concentrations when compared with the base case ones. This is mainly due to the high emissions of intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) assumed in the alternative scheme. The oxidation of these compounds is predicted to be a significant source of secondary organic aerosol. The impact of the other parameters that differ in the two schemes is low to negligible. The monthly average maximum predicted concentrations of the alternative bbOA scheme were approximately an order of magnitude higher than those of the default scheme during all seasons./ The performance of the two schemes was evaluated against observed total organic aerosol concentrations from several measurement sites across the US. The results were different for the different seasons examined. The default scheme performed better during July and September, while the alternative scheme performed a little better during April. These results illustrate the uncertainty of the corresponding predictions and the need to quantify the emissions and reactions of IVOCs from specific biomass sources and to better constrain the total (primary and secondary) bbOA levels.

"Global emissions of NH3, NOx, and N2O from biomass burning and the impact of climate change","Emissions of ammonia (NH3), oxides of nitrogen (NOx; NO +NO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from biomass burning were quantified on a global scale for 2001 to 2015. On average biomass burning emissions at a global scale over the period were as follows: 4.53Â Â± 0.51 Tg NH3 yearâˆ’1, 14.65Â Â± 1.60 Tg NOx yearâˆ’1, and 0.97Â Â± 0.11 Tg N2O yearâˆ’1. Emissions were comparable to other emissions databases. Statistical regression models were developed to project NH3, NOx, and N2O emissions from biomass burning as a function of burn area. Two future climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) were analyzed for 2050â€“2055 (â€œmid-centuryâ€) and 2090â€“2095 (â€œend of centuryâ€). Under the assumptions made in this study, the results indicate emissions of all species are projected to increase under both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate scenarios. Implications: This manuscript quantifies emissions of NH3, NOx, and N2O on a global scale from biomass burning from 2001â€“2015 then creates regression models to predict emissions based on climate change. Because reactive nitrogen emissions have such an important role in the global nitrogen cycle, changes in these emissions could lead to a number of health and environmental impacts. Â© 2020 A&WMA.",
Impact of the variability in vertical separation between biomass burning aerosols and marine stratocumulus on cloud microphysical properties over the Southeast Atlantic,"Marine stratocumulus cloud properties over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean are impacted by contact between above-cloud biomass burning aerosols and cloud tops. Different vertical separations (0 to 2000 m) between the aerosol layer and cloud tops were observed on six research flights in September 2016 during the NASA ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) field campaign. There were 30 contact profiles, where an aerosol layer with aerosol concentration (Na) > 500 cm-3 was within 100 m of cloud tops, and 41 separated profiles, where the aerosol layer with Na > 500 cm-3 was located more than 100 m above cloud tops. For contact profiles, the average cloud droplet concentration (Nc) in the cloud layer was up to 68 cm-3 higher, the effective radius (Re) up to 1.3 Î¼ m lower, and the liquid water content (LWC) within 0.01 gm-3 compared to separated profiles. Free-tropospheric humidity was higher in the presence of biomass burning aerosols, and contact profiles had a smaller decrease in humidity (and positive buoyancy) across cloud tops with higher median above-cloud Na (895 cm-3) compared to separated profiles (30 cm-3). Due to droplet evaporation from entrainment mixing of warm, dry free-tropospheric air into the clouds, the median Nc and LWC for contact profiles decreased with height by 21 and 9 % in the top 20 % of the cloud layer. The impact of droplet evaporation was stronger during separated profiles as a greater decrease in humidity (and negative buoyancy) across cloud tops led to greater decreases in median Nc (30 %) and LWC (16 %) near cloud tops. Below-cloud Na was sampled during 61 profiles, and most contact profiles (20 out of 28) were within high-Na (> 350 cm-3) boundary layers, while most separated profiles (22 out of 33) were within low-Na (< 350 cm-3) boundary layers. Although the differences in below-cloud Na were statistically insignificant, contact profiles within lowNa boundary layers had up to 34.9 cm-3 higher Nc compared to separated profiles. This is consistent with a weaker impact of droplet evaporation in the presence of biomass burning aerosols within 100 m above cloud tops. For contact profiles within high-Na boundary layers, the presence of biomass burning aerosols led to higher below-cloud Na (up to 70.5 cm-3) and additional droplet nucleation above the cloud base along with weaker droplet evaporation. Con sequently, the contact profiles in high-Na boundary layers had up to 88.4 cm-3 higher Nc compared to separated profiles. These results motivate investigations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions over the Southeast Atlantic since the changes in Nc and Re induced by the presence of abovecloud biomass burning aerosols are likely to impact precipitation rates, liquid water path, and cloud fraction, and modulate closed-to-open-cell transitions.

Modeling biomass burning organic aerosol atmospheric evolution and chemical aging,"The changes in the concentration and composition of biomass-burning organic aerosol (OA) downwind of a major wildfire are simulated using the one-dimensional Lagrangian chemical transport model PMCAMx-Trj. A base case scenario is developed based on realistic fire-plume conditions and a series of sensitivity tests are performed to quantify the effects of different conditions and processes. Temperature, oxidant concentration and dilution rate all affect the evolution of biomass burning OA after its emission. The most important process though is the multi-stage oxidation of both the originally emitted organic vapors (volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds) and those resulting from the evaporation of the OA as it is getting diluted. The emission rates of the intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) and their chemical fate have a large impact on the formed secondary OA within the plume. The assumption that these IVOCs undergo only functionalization leads to an overestimation of the produced SOA suggesting that fragmentation is also occurring. Assuming a fragmentation probability of 0.2 resulted in predictions that are more consistent with available observations. Dilution leads to OA evaporation and therefore reduction of the OA levels downwind of the fire. However, the evaporated material can return to the particulate phase later on after it gets oxidized and recondenses. The sensitivity of the OA levels and total mass balance on the dilution rate depends on the modeling assumptions. The high variability of OA mass enhancement observed in past field studies downwind of fires may be partially due to the variability of the dilution rates of the plumes. Â© 2021 by the authors.

Atmospheric wet deposition of major ionic constituents and inorganic nitrogen in Bangladesh: Implications for spatiotemporal variation and source apportionment,"The quantitative and qualitative characterization of ions and inorganic nitrogen in precipitation assists in understanding the accompanying sources and chemistry of regional precipitation. A total of 212 event-based precipitation samples were collected from four sites in Bangladesh in 2017 to investigate the physicochemical characteristics, sources, and deposition of atmospheric ionic constituents and inorganic nitrogen. During the entire monitoring period, 5.7% of the total samples were acidic (i.e., pH < 5.6), indicating that Bangladesh does not suffer severely from acid rain. The electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) values indicate the inverse relationship between the amount of precipitation on the spatiotemporal scale. Ca2+ was the dominant neutralizing factor at four sites, which was demonstrated by the equivalent ratio of the neutralization potential to the acidifying potential and fractional acidity. Moreover, it had the highest volume-weighted mean concentration of all the sites, validating the calcareous nature of the soil aerosolized into the atmosphere. Distinct seasonality was observed for the majority of the ions with higher concentrations in the non-monsoon climate. Sea salt species displayed the pattern of Satkhira > Cox's Bazar > Dinajpur > Sylhet, whereas the anthropogenic species exhibited the order of Dinajpur > Satkhira > Sylhet > Cox's Bazar, underlining the local and regional impacts of these species in Bangladesh. Based on the source apportionment, the sources were categorized as marine (Na+ and Clâˆ’), terrigenous (Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO3âˆ’), fossil fuel combustion (NO3âˆ’ and SO42âˆ’), agriculture (NH4+), and biomass burning (K+). The Clâˆ’ in Sylhet and Satkhira suggests additional sources associated with anthropogenic activities. The back-trajectory analyses and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's final (NCEP FNL) datasets illustrate the presence of significantly diverse air masses with contributions from various sources in the monsoon and non-monsoon climates. Both the amount of precipitation and the ionic quantity governs the fluxes in Bangladesh. The Na+ % and SAR lie under the safe category suggesting a good precipitation water quality for agriculture and soil in Bangladesh, while the deposition of inorganic nitrogen has resulted in a value above the threshold line (10 kg haâˆ’1 yâˆ’1). Thus, this study conveys a comprehensive picture of the ionic composition, providing a baseline dataset to assess the atmospheric environment in this lowland region. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",
Source Quantification of South Asian Black Carbon Aerosols with Isotopes and Modeling,"Black carbon (BC) aerosols perturb climate and impoverish air quality/human health - affecting ?1.5 billion people in South Asia. However, the lack of source-diagnostic observations of BC is hindering the evaluation of uncertain bottom-up emission inventories (EIs) and thereby also models/policies. Here, we present dual-isotope-based (?14C/?13C) fingerprinting of wintertime BC at two receptor sites of the continental outflow. Our results show a remarkable similarity in contributions of biomass and fossil combustion, both from the site capturing the highly populated highly polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain footprint (IGP; ?14C-fbiomass = 50 Â± 3%) and the second site in the N. Indian Ocean representing a wider South Asian footprint (52 Â± 6%). Yet, both sites reflect distinct ?13C-fingerprints, indicating a distinguishable contribution of C4-biomass burning from peninsular India (PI). Tailored-model-predicted season-averaged BC concentrations (700 Â± 440 ng m-3) match observations (740 Â± 250 ng m-3), however, unveiling a systematically increasing model-observation bias (+19% to -53%) through winter. Inclusion of BC from open burning alone does not reconcile predictions (fbiomass = 44 Â± 8%) with observations. Direct source-segregated comparison reveals regional offsets in anthropogenic emission fluxes in EIs, overestimated fossil-BC in the IGP, and underestimated biomass-BC in PI, which contributes to the model-observation bias. This ground-truthing pinpoints uncertainties in BC emission sources, which benefit both climate/air-quality modeling and mitigation policies in South Asia.

Assessment of contribution of agricultural residue burning on air quality of Delhi using remote sensing and modelling tools,"Application of remote sensing in analysing the pollutant dispersion and concentration in the atmosphere has gained importance over the years amongst the researchers. Particulates, being a threat to human health is being closely monitored for its sources and transport, to implement respective mitigative measures. A study has been carried out to assess the contribution of agriculture residue/stubble burning (SB) in Haryana, Punjab region over the air quality of Delhi region. Monitoring is carried out using multidisciplinary approaches over the region during October and November 2017. A higher baseline value in Delhi is observed throughout the study duration. Both remote sensing and ground data from stations show similar characteristics. Local meteorological condition of study region, observed during the study duration, indicates that particulates from Punjab-Haryana region are not likely to be transmitted over Delhi region. The study performed using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) shows some carbonaceous aerosol subtype over Delhi region. Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) study shows that northwesterly winds intersect the agricultural residue burning regions, which might have transported the burnt stubble particulates towards Delhi area during the days of November 2017. Further, the larger mass of stubble burning aerosols are found to be dispersed at a height 3000 m above the ground, which is out of the human vicinity. The month of October 2017 showed aerosol subtypes majorly from local emissions and dust. Delhi faces severe air pollution issues around human vicinity due to poor meteorological conditions and majorly because of local emission. The severe conditions, however, are generally short-lived and gradually ameliorates with improved meteorological conditions of the region. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
Application of aerosol classification methods based on AERONET version 3 product over eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea,"Aerosols released into the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources and natural events affect human health, reduce visibility, and alter Earth's radiation budget. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a quantitative estimate of the amount of aerosol present in the atmosphere, and it can be used as a proxy for surface particulate matters. The AERONET is a network of ground-based sun photometers, providing globally AOD data. Long-term ground-based measurements from all point AERONET V3 Level 2.0 data at 10 sites in the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea region covering the countries of Turkey, Romania, Greece, Ukraine and Cyprus were used to determine spatial and temporal distribution of the selected aerosol parameters such as AOD at 440, 500, 870 nm (AOD440, AOD500, AOD870), Angstrom Exponent at 440â€“870 nm (AE440-870) and fine mode fraction at 500 nm (FMF500) for the period of 1999â€“2018. Since the combination of AOD, AE440-870 and FMF500 enables categorization of aerosol types, two different classification methods were compared in the region. The first method (M1) divides the aerosols into three categories (marine, desert dust and continental) using the parameters of AOD500 and FMF500 whereas the second method (M2) has five categorizations (marine, continental, biomass burning, desert dust, and mixed-type) using the parameters of AOD440 and AE440-870. The multiyear averaged AOD and AE spatiotemporal variability over the region was also presented at a spatial resolution of 0.5Â° Ã— 0.625Â° based on MERRA-2 reanalysis data. The results indicate that marine aerosol was the most predominant type in both methods while continental aerosol type was also obtained at a high rate over the region. The highest AOD occurred in summer, while lowest values were observed in winter. A high volume of fine-mode particles was observed during summer with higher AE values caused by carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning mainly observed at north-western part of the region. In contrast with that, coarse-mode particles, mainly dust, dominated with lower AE values during spring over the southern and eastern parts of the region.

Aerosol optical properties and its type classification based on multiyear joint observation campaign in north China plain megalopolis,"Since haze and other air pollution are frequently seen in the North China Plain (NCP), detail information on aerosol optical and radiative properties and its type classification is demanded for the study of regional environmental pollution. Here, a multiyear ground-based synchronous sun photometer observation at seven sites on North China Plain megalopolis from 2013 to 2018 was conducted. First, the annual and seasonal variation of these characteristics as well as the intercomparsion were analyzed. Then the potential relationships between these properties with meteorological factors and the aerosol type classification were discussed. The results show: Particle volume exhibited a decreasing trend from the urban downtown to suburban and the rural region. The annual average aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD440) varied from âˆ¼0.43 to 0.86 over the NCP. Annual average single-scattering albedo at 440 nm (SSA440) varied from âˆ¼0.89 to 0.93, indicating a moderate to slight absorption capacity. Average absorption aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AAOD440) varied from âˆ¼0.07 to 0.10. The absorption Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (AAE) (âˆ¼0.89â€“1.40) indicated the multi-types of absorptive matters originated form nature and anthropogenic emission. The discussion of aerosol composition showed a smaller particle size of aerosol from biomass burning and/or fossil foil consumption with enhanced aerosol scattering and enlarged light extinction. Aerosol classification indicated a large percentage of mixed absorbing aerosol (âˆ¼20%â€“49%), which showed increasing trend between relative humidity (RH) with aerosol scattering and dust was an important environmental pollutant compared to southern China.

Carbonaceous aerosol composition in air masses influenced by large-scale biomass burning: A case study in northwestern Vietnam,"We investigated concentrations of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and a wide range of particlebound organic compounds in daily sampled PM2:5 at the remote Pha Din (PDI) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) monitoring station in northwestern Vietnam during an intense 3-week sampling campaign from 23 March to 12 April 2015. The site is known to receive trans-regional air masses during large-scale biomass burning (BB) episodes. BB is a globally widespread phenomenon and BB emission characterization is of high scientific and societal relevance. Emissions composition is influenced by multiple factors (e.g., fuel and thereby vegetation type, fuel moisture, fire temperature, available oxygen). Due to regional variations in these parameters, studies in different world regions are needed. OC composition provides valuable information regarding the healthand climate-relevant properties of PM2.5 Yet, OC composition studies from PDI are missing in the scientific literature to date. Therefore, we quantified 51 organic compounds simultaneously by in situ derivatization thermal desorption gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IDTD-GC-TOFMS). Anhydrosugars, methoxyphenols, nalkanes, fatty acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrophenols, and OC were used in a hierarchical cluster analysis highlighting distinctive patterns for periods under low, medium, and high BB influence. The highest particle phase concentration of the typical primary organic aerosol (POA) and possible secondary organic aerosol (SOA) constituents, especially nitrophenols, were found on 5 and 6 April. We linked the trace gas mixing ratios of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) to the statistical classification of BB events based on OA composition and found increased CO and O3 levels during medium and high BB influence. Likewise, a backward trajectory analysis indicates different source regions for the identified periods based on the OA clusters, with cleaner air masses arriving from the northeast, i.e., mainland China and the Yellow Sea. The more polluted periods are characterized by trajectories from the southwest, with more continental recirculation of the medium cluster and more westerly advection for the high cluster. These findings highlight that BB activities in northern Southeast Asia significantly enhance the regional organic aerosol loading and also affect the carbonaceous PM2.5 constituents and the trace gases in northwestern Vietnam. The presented analysis adds valuable data on the carbonaceous and chemical composition of PM2.5, in particular of OC, in a region of scarce data availability, and thus offers a reference dataset from Southeast Asian large-scale BB for future studies. Such a reference dataset may be useful for the evaluation of atmospheric transport simulation models, or for comparison with other world regions and BB types, such as Australian bush fires, African savannah fires, or tropical peatland fires.

Aerosol characteristics at the Southern Great Plains site during the HI-SCALE campaign,"Large uncertainties exist in global climate model predictions of radiative forcing due to insufficient understanding and simplified numerical representation of cloud formation and cloud-aerosol interactions. The Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols and Land Ecosystems (HI-SCALE) campaign was conducted near the DOE's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in north-central Oklahoma to provide a better understanding of land-atmosphere interactions, aerosol and cloud properties, and the influence of aerosol and land- atmosphere interactions on cloud formation. The HI-SCALE campaign consisted of two intensive observational periods (IOPs) (April-May and August-September, 2016), during which coincident measurements were conducted both on the G-1 aircraft platform and at the SGP ground site. In this study we focus on the observations at the SGP ground site. An Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and an Ionicon protontransfer- reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) were deployed, characterizing chemistry of non-refractory aerosol and trace gases, respectively. Contributions from various aerosol sources, including biogenic and biomass burning emissions, were retrieved using factor analysis of the AMS data. In general, the organic aerosols at the SGP site was highly oxidized, with oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) identified as the dominant factor for both the spring and summer IOP though more aged in spring. Cases of isopreneepoxydiol- derived secondary organic aerosol (IEPOX SOA) and biomass burning events were further investigated to understand additional sources of organic aerosol. Unlike other regions largely impacted by IEPOX chemistry, the IEPOX SOA at SGP was more highly oxygenated, likely due to the relatively weak local emissions of isoprene. Biogenic emissions appear to largely control the formation of organic aerosol (OA) during the HI-SCALE campaign. Potential HOM (highly oxygenated molecule) chemistry likely contributes to the highly oxygenated feature of aerosols at the SGP site, with impacts on new particle formation and global climate.

Evaluating the impacts of burning biomass on PM2.5 regional transport under various emission conditions,"The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emitted by burning biomass has become the main source of pollution in cities; this pollution seriously threatens the ecosystem and inhabitants' health. A major challenge in dealing with this issue is the uncertainty regarding the influence of burning biomass on PM2.5 regional transport. In this study, Harbin-Changchun Megalopolis is the research area. Using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model combined with satellite data and PM2.5 monitoring data, we quantitatively analyzed the regional transport of PM2.5 from burning biomass upwind of each city under different emission conditions. Conditions at burn sites, especially emission intensity and meteorological factors, as well as transport distance play significant roles in the regional transport of PM2.5. Higher emission intensity aggravated the concentration of downwind PM2.5, at most 19.7 Î¼g â‹… mâˆ’3. Shorter transport distance strengthened the impact of biomass burning on downstream PM2.5 by weakening elimination, which could be up to 96.8 Î¼g â‹… mâˆ’3. Moreover, meteorological factors at fire points were closely related to the transport of PM2.5. First, lower planetary boundary layer height could enhance the transport of PM2.5 from the burning biomass by inhibiting vertical diffusion, and the enhancement could be up to 46.1 Î¼g â‹… mâˆ’3. Second, compared to strong wind, light wind caused the weaker dilution, enhancing PM2.5 regional transport by as much as 32.5 Î¼g â‹… mâˆ’3. Third, relatively humidity at 30%-40% had the strongest effect in facilitating the transport of PM2.5 from burning biomass. We conclude that comprehensively considering these three factors, namely the emission intensity, transport distance and meteorological factors at burn sites can facilitate the cross-regional development of accurate prediction models and effective pollution control measures.

Spatially Resolved Photochemistry Impacts Emissions Estimates in Fresh Wildfire Plumes,"Wildfire emissions affect downwind air quality and human health. Predictions of these impacts using models are limited by uncertainties in emissions and chemical evolution of smoke plumes. Using high-time-resolution aircraft measurements, we illustrate spatial variations that can exist within a plume due to differences in the photochemical environment. Horizontal and vertical crosswind gradients of dilution-corrected mixing ratios were observed in midday plumes for reactive compounds and their oxidation products, such as nitrous acid, catechol, and ozone, likely due to faster photochemistry in optically thinner plume edges relative to darker plume cores. Gradients in plumes emitted close to sunset are characterized by titration of O3 in the plume and reduced or no gradient formation. We show how crosswind gradients can lead to underestimated emission ratios for reactive compounds and overestimated emission ratios for oxidation products. These observations will lead to improved predictions of wildfire emissions, evolution, and impacts across daytime and nighttime. Â© 2021. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",
Exploring the Constraints on Simulated Aerosol Sources and Transport Across the North Atlantic With Island-Based Sun Photometers,"Atmospheric aerosol over the North Atlantic Ocean impacts regional clouds and climate. In this work, we use a set of sun photometer observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) located on the Graciosa and Cape Verde islands, along with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to investigate the sources of these aerosol and their transport over the North Atlantic Ocean. At both locations, the largest simulated contributor to aerosol extinction is the local source of sea-salt aerosol. In addition to this large source, we find that signatures consistent with long-range transport of anthropogenic, biomass burning, and dust emissions are apparent throughout the year at both locations. Model simulations suggest that this signal of long-range transport in AOD is more apparent at higher elevation locations; the influence of anthropogenic and biomass burning aerosol extinction is particularly pronounced at the height of Pico Mountain, near the Graciosa Island site. Using a machine learning approach, we further show that simulated observations at these three sites (near Graciosa, Pico Mountain, and Cape Verde) can be used to predict the simulated background aerosol imported into cities on the European mainland, particularly during the local winter months, highlighting the utility of background AOD monitoring for understanding downwind air quality.

"Comparison of spatial modelling approaches on PM10 and No2 concentration variations: A case study in Surabaya city, Indonesia","Because of fast-paced industrialization, urbanization, and population growth in Indonesia, there are serious health issues in the country resulting from air pollution. This study uses geospatial modelling technologies, namely land-use regression (LUR), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographic and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) models, to assess variations in particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in Surabaya City, Indonesia. This is the first study to implement spatiotemporal variability of air pollution concentrations in Surabaya City, Indonesia. To develop the prediction models, air pollution data collected from seven monitoring stations from 2010 to 2018 were used as dependent variables, while land-use/land cover allocations within a 250 m to 5000 m circular buffer range surrounding the monitoring stations were collected as independent variables. A supervised stepwise variable selection procedure was applied to identify the important predictor variables for developing the LUR, GWR, and GTWR models. The developed models of LUR, GWR, and GTWR accounted for 49%, 50%, and 51% of PM10 variations and 46%, 47%, and 48% of NO2 variations, respectively. The GTWR model performed better (R2 = 0.51 for PM10 and 0.48 for NO2) than the other two models (R2 = 0.49â€“0.50 for PM10 and 0.46â€“0.47 for NO2), LUR and GWR. In the PM10 model four predictor variables, public facility, industry and warehousing, paddy field, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were selected during the variable selection procedure. Meanwhile, paddy field, residential area, rainfall, and temperature played important roles in explaining NO2 variations. Because of biomass burning issues in South Asia, the paddy field, which has a positive correlation with PM10 and NO2, was selected as a predictor. By using long-term monitoring data to establish prediction models, this model may better depict PM10 and NO2 concentration variations within areas across Asia. Â© 2020 by the authors.

Climatology and classification of aerosols based on optical properties over selected stations in Iraq,"Atmospheric aerosol plays an important role in the earth's radiation budget, air quality and human health. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) data are extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectoradiometer (MODIS) with resolution of 1Â° Ã— 1Â°covering seven selected regions in Iraq: Mosul, Sulaimaniyah, Rutba, Baghdad, Nukhayb, Nasiriyah and Basra for the period (2001-2018), in order to earn the detailed knowledge of aerosols behavior and classification for each season. The Results indicates high variability in (AOD) ranging from (0.05-0.9) with highest values occurred during June-April (0.92, 0.90) in Basra and Nukhuyb respectively, whereas the minimum values were observed during October-November (0.051, 0.055) over Sulaimaniyah and Mosul respectively. The AE records exhibit an opposite behavior to AOD, and highest AE values occurred during winter and autumn which indicates dominant fine particles, and lowest values observed during spring and summer due to dominant coarse particles for whole study area except Nukhayb. Appropriate thresholds for AOD and AE have been employed to classify the aerosol type into maritime, dust, urban, desert dust, biomass burning and the residual cases that do not belong to the threshold used are considered as mixture type for all regions.

Study of the extent of contribution of regional stubble burning to the air pollution in Delhi-national capital region,"The issue of extreme episodic air pollution events in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR), India, during the month of November has been of concern for the last few years. Recent studies have used satellite observations and transport models, which indicate movement of smoke from stubble burning regions in Punjab and Haryana towards Delhi. Quantification of contribution of these emissions to the air pollution in Delhi, however, remains uncertain. In the present study, a similar attempt was made, and measurements are reported from 16 ground-based continuous air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) in the Delhi-NCR for the years 2016 and 2017. Time series PM2.5 ground measurements were compared with the total Fire Radiative Power (FRP) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites for the airshed for Delhi-NCR. To quantify the smoke contribution from the fire pixels to the Delhi-NCR, the Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System (NAAPS) smoke data were used. NAAPS simulations show that the smoke aerosol contribution to Delhi-NCR from stubble burning was ~5-10 Âµg/m3 during the pollution episodic days in 2016. NAAPS results along with the PM2.5 measurements at Ludhiana, Punjab, indicate that the stubble burning emissions may contribute 33-66 Âµg/m3 to the PM2.5 at Delhi depending on wind conditions and emission levels at the source. The predominant aerosols over the study area during the episodic period were verified to be absorbing in nature. Limited meteorological data indicated low temperatures and high relative humidity conditions during the episodic events. Â© 2019 Air and Waste Management Association. All rights reserved.",
"Distribution, sources and potential health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM2.5 collected during different monsoon seasons and haze episode in Kuala Lumpur","This study aimed to determine the distribution and potential health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM2.5 collected in Kuala Lumpur during different monsoon seasons. The potential sources of PM2.5 were investigated using 16 priority PAHs with additional of biomass tracers namely levoglucosan (LV), mannosan (MN) and galactosan (GL). This study also investigated the cytotoxic potential of the extracted PAHs towards V79-4 cells. A high-volume air sampler (HVS) was used to collect PM2.5 samples for 24 h. PAHs were extracted using dichloromethane (DCM) while biomass tracers were extracted by a mixture of DCM/methanol (3:1) before analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The cytotoxicity of the PAHs extract was determined by assessing the cell viability through the reduction of tetrazolium salts (MTT). The results showed that the total mean Â± SD concentrations of PAHs during the southwest (SW) and northeast (NE) monsoons were 2.51 Â± 0.93 ng mâˆ’3 and 1.37 Â± 0.09 ng mâˆ’3, respectively. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) using PAH and biomass tracer concentrations suggested four potential sources of PM2.5; gasoline emissions (29.1%), natural gas and coal burning (28.3%), biomass burning (22.3%), and diesel and heavy oil combustion (20.3%). Health risk assessment showed insignificant incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) of 2.40E-07 for 70 years of exposure. MTT assay suggested that PAHs extracts collected during SW monsoon have cytotoxic effect towards V79-4 cell at the concentrations of 25 Î¼g mLâˆ’1, 50 Î¼g mLâˆ’1, 100 Î¼g mLâˆ’1 whereas non-cytotoxic effect was observed on the PAHs sample collected during NE monsoon.

Simulation of fresh and chemically-aged biomass burning organic aerosol,"A three-dimensional chemical transport model, PMCAMx, was used to quantify the contribution of biomass burning organic aerosol (bbOA) to total organic aerosol (OA) concentrations in the continental U.S. Simulations were performed during three seasonally-representative months (April, July, and September 2008). Biomass burning is predicted to contribute 9% of the domain-averaged OA in April, 28% in July and 13% in September. Secondary OA from semivolatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds is the largest contributor to bbOA concentrations for all months simulated, followed by fresh primary OA. PMCAMx bbOA predictions using the Volatility Basis Set were compared to the results of CAMx version 6.10 that assumes that bbOA is nonvolatile and inert. PMCAMx predicts 66%, 113%, and 108% higher average concentration values of bbOA for April, July, and September, respectively. Predicted OA concentrations at biomass-impacted sites were compared to observed values from the STN and IMPROVE networks. The treatment of biomass burning emissions as semivolatile and reactive improved model performance during the spring and summer. During the fall both models overpredicted the OA levels, suggesting that the fire emissions may have been overestimated. In this case the additional SOA produced in PMCAMx resulted in worse performance. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",
Impact of biomass burning on regional aerosol optical properties: A case study over northern India,"The present study examines the spatial, seasonal and inter annual variation of biomass burning and its impact on regional aerosol optical properties over Northern India using multi-satellite aerosol observations: Active fire points, AOD (550 nm) and AE (550âˆ’860 nm) from MODIS retrievals during January 2003â€“December 2017 and AAOD (388 nm), SSA (388 nm) and AI from OMI UV retrievals during January 2005â€“December 2017. Results from MODIS active fire count statistics indicate an increase in the number of fire occurrences (average 1477 fires per year) over India in a period of 15 years (2003-2017). The dominant fire seasons are (i) Pre-monsoon (March to May) accounting to more than 45% and (ii) Post-Monsoon having 24% of total annual fires counts. However, the crop residue burning hotspot region located in Punjab and Haryana, constitutes 26% of the total fires in India. At an average, 15456 (77.08%) fire counts were reported during the paddy season, whereas 3296 (16.44%) fire counts during wheat season respectively. The crop residue burning over the northwest IGP (Punjab) significantly affect the aerosol optical properties locally as well in the downwind regions during post-monsoon season i.e., crop residue fires increased by 4% (170 fires per year) with corresponding AOD, AAOD & AI increased by 8%, 9% & 11% respectively. The satellite observation shows large gradient of aerosol parameters from north-west to south-east along the Himalayan foot-hills which indicates the regional transport of smoke aerosols over the region. This is also supported by ground based AOD observations at four locations (Patiala, Delhi, Dehradun and Kanpur) and Black Carbon measurements at two locations (Patiala and Dehradun). The climatological averaged values of ground based AOD550 for Patiala, Delhi, Dehradun and Kanpur are 0.52 Â± 0.26, 0.75 Â± 0.40, 0.45 Â± 0.24 and 0.57 Â± 0.29 respectively whereas BC concentrations are 8.43 Â± 3.14 Î¼g mâˆ’3 & 3.36 Â± 1.26 Î¼g mâˆ’3 for Patiala & Dehradun respectively. Comparison of MODIS derived AOD agrees well with ground based AODs (overall R = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.14). In addition, CALIPSO shows the maximum amount of biomass burning smoke aerosols present within the atmospheric boundary layer and some cases it extending up to 2â€“3 km altitudes. The smoke aerosol transport pathways originated from crop residue burning were analyzed using Hysplit forward trajectories. The results reveal that majority of smoke aerosols are transported to eastern IGP, central India and adjacent oceanic regions during post-monsoon season. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
"Biomass Burning Plumes in the Vicinity of the California Coast: Airborne Characterization of Physicochemical Properties, Heating Rates, and Spatiotemporal Features","This study characterizes in situ airborne properties associated with biomass burning (BB) plumes in the vicinity of the California coast. Out of 231 total aircraft soundings in Julyâ€“August 2013 and 2016, 81 were impacted by BB layers. A number of vertical characteristics of BB layers are summarized in this work (altitude, location relative to cloud top height, thickness, number of vertically adjacent layers, interlayer distances) in addition to differences in vertical aerosol concentration profiles due to either surface type (e.g., land or ocean) or time of day. Significant BB layer stratification occurred, especially over ocean versus land, with the majority of layers in the free troposphere and within 100Â m of the boundary layer top. Heating rate profiles demonstrated the combined effect of cloud and BB layers and their mutual interactions, with enhanced heating in BB layers with clouds present underneath. Aerosol size distribution data are summarized below and above the boundary layer, with a notable finding being enhanced concentrations of supermicrometer particles in BB conditions. A plume aging case study revealed the dominance of organics in the free troposphere, with secondary production of inorganic and organic species and coagulation as a function of distance from fire source up to 450Â km. Rather than higher horizontal and vertical resolution, a new smoke injection height method was the source of improved agreement for the vertical distribution of BB aerosol in the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System model when compared to airborne data.

Carbonaceous aerosol emission reduction over Shandong province and the impact of air pollution control as observed from synthetic satellite data,"Aerosol loading and trace gas emissions from agriculture crop residue burning has been one of the main factors leading to the deterioration of air quality especially during the harvest time in China. Here, we evaluate the contribution of atmospheric aerosol loading from biomass burning and its relationship to the air pollution control policy. We focused on Shandong province, China because it has the highest level of agriculture burning pollution in October. Satellite-based data related to biomass burning including aerosol optical depth (AOD) and fire pixel counts from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), carbon monoxide (CO) from Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT), aerosol index (AI) and tropospheric NO2 from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and aerosol layer depths from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). These metrics were synthetically utilized to evaluate spatial and temporal variation of atmospheric aerosols during the agriculture crop residue burning month from 2006 to 2017. Carbonaceous aerosol emission reduction and the impact of the air pollution control policy can be found in the CALIPSO aerosol types and MODIS fire pixel counts data. The AOD, NO2, CO, and AI over three different land covers (cropland, forest and impervious surfaces) were further obtained according to the land cover data set. The results indicated that there was an obvious decrease in all carbonaceous aerosol-related quantities after year 2012 when the local government began to enact and implement strict air pollution control policies, although a period (2â€“3 years) of transition after the policy implementation time was identified. We also found that CO is stable and low over the cropland versus forest and impervious surfaces; NO2 exhibits a continuously high value in the northern areas of the oil field. The impact of industry activity rather than straw burning should be also considered for NO2 and CO in certain areas. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
Variability in Atmospheric Methane From Fossil Fuel and Microbial Sources Over the Last Three Decades,"Atmospheric measurements show an increase in CH4 from the 1980s to 1998 followed by a period of near-zero growth until 2007. However, from 2007, CH4 has increased again. Understanding the variability in CH4 is critical for climate prediction and climate change mitigation. We examine the role of CH4 sources and the dominant CH4 sink, oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH), in atmospheric CH4 variability over the past three decades using observations of CH4, C2H6, and Î´13CCH4 in an inversion. From 2006 to 2014, microbial and fossil fuel emissions increased by 36Â Â±Â 12 and 15Â Â±Â 8Â TgÂ yâˆ’1, respectively. Emission increases were partially offset by a decrease in biomass burning of 3Â Â±Â 2Â TgÂ yâˆ’1 and increase in soil oxidation of 5Â Â±Â 6Â TgÂ yâˆ’1. A change in the atmospheric sink did not appear to be a significant factor in the recent growth of CH4. Â©2018. The Authors.",
"Effects of plant residue management on soil properties, surface runoff, and soil loss under rainfall simulation in a semi-arid region in Iran","A 5-year field study was conducted on the effect of plant residue management on soil erosion, runoff, bulk density, penetration resistance, and organic carbon. There were three treatments: burning residues on field (BR), returning residues unto the soil surface after harvesting (TR), and removing residues from soil surface (RR) (control treatment). At the end of the 5-year treatment, a rainfall simulation at 90 mm hâˆ’1 was applied to each plot. After rainfall simulation started, the runoff volume and soil loss amount in samples were collected at four sampling times. The results showed that the runoff volume for BR (from 145.5 Â± 12.2 to 190.0 Â± 11.8 mL) differed significantly (p â‰¤ 0.01) from that of RR (from 32.3 Â± 5.5 to 67.5 Â± 11.1 mL) and TR (from 10.0 Â± 0.7 to 16.7 Â± 3.3 mL). A significant difference (p â‰¤ 0.01) was also observed between RR and TR regarding runoff volume and soil loss amount in different sampling times, except for the first sampling time (2â€“4 min). The runoff volume in BR and TR was 215% higher and 294% lower than that of the control (RR), respectively. As compared to the control (RR), soil loss decreased by 96.5% in TR but increased by 192% in BR. The BR increased soil bulk density and penetration resistance by 4.9% and 12.4%, whereas TR reduced them by 2.1% and 15.8%, respectively, as compared to the control (RR). The results indicated that the highest (0.35) and lowest (0.03) runoff coefficients were obtained for BR and TR treatments, respectively. It is concluded that returning plant residues to soil is the best residue management practice in decreasing soil runoff volume and controlling soil erosion in semi-arid regions.

Agriculture Crop Residue Burning and Its Consequences on Respiration Health of School-Going Children,"Crop waste burning in open fields is a matter of concern in relation to health-related complications in humans of all age groups, especially children. An epidemiological study was been done on school children to estimate the decline in their physiological parameters due to crop residue burning activity. A total of 150 children were inspected for 3 years (2013-2016) at 3 different sites in India. During sampling periods, spirometric tests, ambient particulate matter having size â‰¥10 Âµgâˆ’3 and â‰¥2.5 Âµgâˆ’3, and other covariates were measured twice in a fortnight. After adjustment of data in multivariate mixed-effect model, prediction and statistical analyses were done. From results obtained, it has been observed that season wise, the level of fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) was higher in rice crop residue burning seasons than in wheat crop residue burning seasons by 87% to 123% than permitted monthly limits. As per dose-response relationship, maximum degradation was observed in forced vital capacity (âˆ’7.62%) and peak expiratory flow (âˆ’6.23%) parameters from their baseline values due to burning activities. Prediction equations have been purposed to observe the future trends in physiological parameters of children. Based on Tiffeneau index, an unrecoverable effect was seen in lung parameters. Trends were alarming and may cause serious complications in early age of humans. Â© The Author(s) 2019.",
What caused severe air pollution episode of November 2016 in New Delhi?,"In recent years, South Asia is experiencing severely degraded air quality, with particulate matter less than 2.5 Î¼m (PM2.5) reaching unprecedented high levels. Here, we investigate a severe air pollution episode (SAPE) witnessed in New Delhi during 1â€“7 November 2016. This was a very unusual air pollution episode wherein air quality index exceeded >500 and was persistent for about a week encapsulating the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). We demonstrate that a stagnant weather condition was the dominant cause of the SAPE. Mean concentration of PM2.5 in New Delhi before, during, and after the SAPE were 142 Î¼g/m3, 563 Î¼g/m3, and 240 Î¼g/m3, respectively. Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD), ultraviolet-aerosol index (UV-AI) and surface carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations also showed significant enhancements over large locale spatially by about 50â€“70% during the SAPE. A large and simultaneous increase in UV-AI and CO downwind of a large number of fire hotspots (Punjab and Haryana) is a clear indication of biomass burning aerosols. Analysis of absorption Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent further substantiates this finding, showing a large fraction of light absorbing carbonaceous-type aerosols. Radiosonde observations clearly showed that stagnant atmospheric conditions led to SAPE in New Delhi by allowing pollution to accumulate and persist in the near-surface environment. As a result new particle formation was suppressed due to very high pre-existing aerosol concentrations during the SAPE. The heating rate induced by light absorbing aerosols into an atmospheric layer during SAPE was also very high (3.1 Â± 0.7 K/day). These findings will help in understanding air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate these complex pollution episodes in an anthropogenic future.

Impact of urban growth on air quality in Indian cities using hierarchical Bayesian approach,"Several studies have found rising ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in urban areas across developing countries. For setting mitigation policies source-contribution is needed, which is calculated mostly through computationally intensive chemical transport models or manpower intensive source apportionment studies. Data based approach that use remote sensing datasets can help reduce this challenge, specially in developing countries which lack spatially and temporally dense air quality monitoring networks. Our objective was identifying relative contribution of urban emission sources to monthly PM2.5 ambient concentrations and assessing whether urban expansion can explain rise of PM2.5 ambient concentration from 2001 to 2015 in 15 Indian cities. We adapted the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) emission framework in a land use regression (LUR) model to estimate concentrations by statistically modeling the impact of urban growth on aerosol concentrations with the help of remote sensing datasets. Contribution to concentration from six key sources (residential, industrial, commercial, crop fires, brick kiln and vehicles) was estimated by inverse distance weighting of their emissions in the land-use regression model. A hierarchical Bayesian approach was used to account for the random effects due to the heterogeneous emitting sources in the 15 cities. Long-term ambient PM2.5 concentration from 2001 to 2015, was represented by a indicator R (varying from 0 to 100), decomposed from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived AOD (aerosol optical depth) and angstrom exponent datasets. The model was trained on annual-level spatial land-use distribution and technological advancement data and the monthly-level emission activity of 2001 and 2011 over each location to predict monthly R. The results suggest that above the central portion of a city, concentration due to primary PM2.5 emission is contributed mostly by residential areas (35.0 Â± 11.9%), brick kilns (11.7 Â± 5.2%) and industries (4.2 Â± 2.8%). The model performed moderately for most cities (median correlation for out of time validation was 0.52), especially when assumed changes in seasonal emissions for each source reflected actual seasonal changes in emissions. The results suggest the need for policies focusing on emissions from residential regions and brick kilns. The relative order of the contributions estimated by this study is consistent with other recent studies and a contribution of up to 42.8 Â± 14.1% is attributed to the formation of secondary aerosol, long-range transport and unaccounted sources in surrounding regions. The strength of this approach is to be able to estimate the contribution of urban growth to primary aerosols statistically with a relatively low computation cost compared to the more accurate but computationally expensive chemical transport based models. This remote sensing based approach is especially useful in locations without emission inventory. Â© 2019 by the authors.",
Precipitation chemistry and stable isotopic characteristics at Wengguo in the northern slopes of the Himalayas,"The major ions in precipitation can reflect the conditions of the atmosphere, while stable isotopic characteristics provide information on the moisture source. In order to understand the local hydro-chemical features and regional geochemical cycle, it is essential to assess the chemical composition of precipitation and the associated sources. Therefore, a total of 57 precipitation samples (2016 to 2017) for major ions and 178 samples (2013 to 2017) for stable isotopes were collected from the Wengguo station and analyzed to explore the major ionic deposition and stable isotopic characteristics in the northern slopes of the Himalayas. The average pH and electrical conductivity were 6.82 Â± 0.45 and 15.36 Â± 11.67 Î¼S cmâˆ’1, respectively. Ca2+ followed by K+ and Mg2+ played a crucial role in neutralizing the precipitation acidity. The major ionic sources in the region were terrigenous (Ca2+, HCO3âˆ’, and Mg2+) and sea salt (Na+, Clâˆ’, and Mg2+), as well as anthropogenic emissions (SO42âˆ’ and NO3âˆ’) and biomass burning (K+). The total deposition flux of the major ions was higher in 2016 than in 2017 and was influenced by the higher precipitation. The average values of Î´18O and Î´D in precipitation were âˆ’ 15.22 Â± 5.17 â€° and âˆ’ 116.01 Â± 41.31 â€°, respectively. The precipitation stable isotopes were not significantly correlated to the local air temperature but the precipitation amount. Moreover, the variation in stable isotopes, local meteoric water line, and d-excess indicated the existence of continental and monsoon moisture transport systems. The transport of chemicals over the high elevation region from polluted cities in South Asia via moisture originating in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea was determined based on the source identification, clusters of air mass backward trajectory analysis, and the National Center for Environmental Prediction Final dataset. Thus, the ionic concentrations and stable isotopic characteristics of the precipitation from this study provided a valuable dataset to assess the atmospheric environment in the northern slopes of the Himalayas at Southern Tibetan Plateau.

Aerosol Optical Characteristics During the Biomass Burning Season in Southeastern Mexico,"In this paper, we present a characterization of the optical properties of the aerosols emitted during biomass burning (BB) season in the period 2005â€“2009. Trends of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (Î±), and precipitable water (PW) were analyzed using a 5-year dataset from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations over Tuxtla Gutierrez (TG), Chiapas. The overall mean AOD (500Â nm) during the 2005â€“2009 period was 0.26 Â± 0.18. However, monthly mean values of AOD > 0.5 during the spring months (April and May) would indicate the high load of particles emitted by fires. The overall mean of Î± (440â€“870Â nm) was 1.40 Â± 0.21, which confirms the presence of fine aerosols. Additionally, the combined analysis of the Î± with its spectral curvature Î´Î±, and the results from the spectral de-convolution algorithm (SDA) shows that fine-mode aerosols dominated AOD variability in TG. In this paper, the trajectories of air masses (400 and 1500Â m, a.s.l.) arriving at the TG site were classified by using backward trajectory cluster analysis. Trajectory clustering results indicate a BB regional transport from Central America that affects the atmosphere in southeastern Mexico. We use observations of fire radiative power (FRP) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to study the incidence of wildfires and to estimate the BB emissions from 2005 to 2009 in southeastern Mexico. The results indicated a gradual decrease in fires throughout the years. Campeche and Yucatan are the states in southeastern Mexico where BB produces the highest emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), black carbon (BC), and particulate material PM2.5. However, the largest emissions come from wildfires in Guatemala. Finally, to put in context the aerosol optical properties over southeastern Mexico, the sun photometric measurements in TG are compared with those retrieved from AERONET stations located in other tropical biomass burning regions (Brazil and Zambia).

Estimating the open biomass burning emissions in central and eastern China from 2003 to 2015 based on satellite observation,"Open biomass burning (OBB) has significant impacts on air pollution, climate change and potential human health. OBB has gathered wide attention but with little focus on the annual variation of pollutant emission. Central and eastern China (CEC) is one of the most polluted regions in China. This study aims to provide a state-of-the-art estimation of the pollutant emissions from OBB in CEC from 2003 to 2015, by adopting the satellite observation dataset - the burned area product (MCD64Al) and the active fire product (MCD14 ML) - along with local biomass data (updated biomass loading data and high-resolution vegetation data) and local emission factors. The successful adoption of the double satellite dataset for long-term estimation of pollutants from OBB with a high spatial resolution can support the assessing of OBB on regional air quality, especially for harvest periods or dry seasons. It is also useful to evaluate the effects of annual OBB management policies in different regions. Here, monthly emissions of pollutants were estimated and allocated into a 1Ã—1km spatial grid for four types of OBB including grassland, shrubland, forest and cropland. From 2003 to 2015, the emissions from forest, shrubland and grassland fire burning had an annual fluctuation, whereas the emissions from crop straw burning steadily increased. The cumulative emissions of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), methane (CH4), nitric oxide (NO x), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and fine particles (PM2.5) were 3.64Ã—103, 2.87Ã—102, 3.05Ã—103, 1.82Ã—103, 6.4Ã—103, 2.12Ã—102, 4.67Ã—102, 4.59Ã—104, 9.39Ã—105 and 4.13Ã—103Gg in these years, respectively. Crop straw burning was the largest contributor for all pollutant emissions, by 84%-96%. For the forest, shrubland and grassland fire burning, forest fire burning emissions contributed the most, and emissions from grassland fire were negligible due to little grass coverage in this region. High pollutant emissions concentrated in the connection area of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu and Anhui, with emission intensity higher than 100 tons per square kilometer, which was related to the frequent agricultural activities in these regions. Peak emission of pollutants occurred during summer and autumn harvest periods including May, June, September and October, during which 1/4 50% of the total pollutant emissions were emitted in these months. This study highlights the importance of controlling the crop straw burning emissions. From December to March, the crop residue burning emissions decreased, while the emissions from forest, shrubland and grassland exhibited their highest values, leading to another small peak in emissions of pollutants. Obvious regional differences in seasonal variations of OBB were observed due to different local biomass types and environmental conditions. Rural population, agricultural output, economic levels, local burning habits, social customs and management policies were all influencing factors for OBB emissions. Â© Author(s) 2018.",
"A comprehensive inventory of agricultural atmospheric particulate matters (PM10 and PM2.5) and gaseous pollutants (VOCs, SO2, NH3, CO, NOx and HC) emissions in China","Atmospheric pollutants emitted from agriculture are a key factor in regional air quality. However, previous studies of agricultural sources have only focused on agricultural burning, livestock or fertilizer; comprehensive agricultural emission inventories involving main agricultural operations are still lacking in China, which would limit our ability to understand, predict and control the effects of agricultural emissions on air quality and human health. This study presents the latest county-level sector-specific emission inventories of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and gaseous pollutants (VOCs, SO2, NH3, CO and NOx) from six agricultural sectors, including land preparation, crop harvesting, crop residue burning, grain processing, fertilizer application and agricultural machinery, based on a bottom-up emission estimation method. Agricultural activity data were collected from statistical yearbooks, and emission factors of each operation were adopted from published data. Annual emissions of PM10, PM2.5, VOCs, SO2, NH3, CO, and NOx from agricultural operations during 2015 in China were estimated to be 2867.4 Gg, 1941.1 Gg, 2321.9 Gg, 139.6 Gg, 1072.7 Gg, 10149.9 Gg and 1433.2 Gg, respectively. Higher pollutant emissions are found in Eastern and Central China. Atmospheric pollutant emissions show a primary peak in October in North, Northeast, Northwest and Southwest and in June and July in other regions. The historic trends (1997â€“2015) of agricultural emissions have shown annual average growth rates of 0.9%/yr, 1.3%/yr, 1.5%/yr, 2.5%/yr, 1.1%/yr, 1.2%/yr and 0.6%/yr for PM10, PM2.5, VOCs, NOx, SO2, CO and NH3, respectively. The detailed agricultural emission inventory generated by this study could provide useful information for air quality modeling and support the development of appropriate pollution control strategies.

"Azolla pinnata, Aspergillus terreus, and Eisenia fetida for fasterrecycling of nutrients from wheat straw","A vast amount of surplus wheat straw/stubble (a carbon-rich bioresource) is wasted every year by burning. Harmful gases and residue matter released due to burning cause harmful effects on the environment and human health. Therefore, there is a strong need to recycle this bioresource in a sustainable manner. In the present study, wheat straw (W) was spiked with cattle dung (C), Azolla pinnata (A), and Aspergillus terreus (F) to make eight different treatments (1 kg each), viz. W (1 kg), WC (666 g + 334 g), WA (980 g + 20 g), WF (980 g + 20 ml), WCF (666 g + 314 g + 20 ml), WCA (666 g + 314 g + 20 g), WFA (960 g+ 20 ml + 20 g), and WCFA(666 g + 294 g + 20 ml + 20 g), and subjected to vermicomposting (Vcom) and aerobic composting (Acom). A comparison was made for the time required for degradation and nutrient profile of the products. The fastest recycling of wheat straw/stubble (120 days) was observed in WCA and WCFA, but the nutrient quality of WCA was better (N 18.67, P 3.88, K 38.84 g/kg). In the Acom group, longer time was required for degradation of various mixtures, but in this group also, WCA was degraded first of all (138 days) and yielded a product with the best nutrient quality (N 14.77, P 2.56, K 28.80 g/kg). Maximum growth of E. fetida and maximum number of hatchlings were observed in WCA while the highest cocoon production was observed in WCFA. It was observed that azolla enhanced conversion of wheat straw into a nutrient-rich product for agronomic use. Thus its use will reduce the amount of cattle dung in the mixture and the bulk to be handled by the farmers for ecosafe disposal of surplus straw/stubble. Therefore, this technology can be adopted as an alternative to burning. Â© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",
Assessment and quantification of NOx sources at a regional background site in North China: Comparative results from a Bayesian isotopic mixing model and a positive matrix factorization model,"Regional sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in North China during summer were explored using both a Bayesian isotopic mixing model and a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. Results showed that the nitrogen isotope (Î´15N) composition of particulate nitrate (NO3                             âˆ’) varied between âˆ’8.9â€° and +14.1â€° while the oxygen isotope (Î´18O) composition ranged from +57.4â€° to +93.8â€°. Based on results from the Bayesian isotopic mixing model, the contribution of the hydroxyl radical (â€¢OH) NOx conversion pathway showed clear diurnal fluctuation; values were higher during the day (0.53 Â± 0.16) and lower overnight (0.42 Â± 0.17). Values peaked at 06:00â€“12:00 and then decreased gradually until 00:00â€“06:00 the next day. Coal combustion (31.34 Â± 9.04%) was the most significant source of NOx followed by biomass burning (25.74 Â± 2.58%), mobile sources (23.83 Â± 3.66%), and microbial processes (19.09 Â± 5.21%). PMF results indicated that the contribution from mobile sources was 19.83%, slightly lower as compared to the Bayesian model (23.83%). The PMF model also reported a lower contribution from coal combustion (28.65%) as compared to the Bayesian model (31.34%); however, the sum of biomass burning and microbial processes in the Bayesian model (44.83%) was lower than the aggregate of secondary inorganic aerosol, sea salt, and soil dust in PMF model (51.52%). Overall, differences between the two models were minor, suggesting that this study provided a reasonable source quantification for NOx in North China during summer. Resulting NOx source difference from Bayesian isotopic mixing model and PMF model in North China was minor with the largest discrepancy of 6.69%. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",
"First two and a half years of aerosol measurements with an AERONET sunphotometer at the Huancayo Observatory, Peru","Direct sun measurements with a CIMEL sunphotometer belonging to the AERONET network have been performed in the Huancayo Observatory, Peru, from March 2015 to August 2017, two and a half years, providing for the first time information about aerosols in the specific area. The prevalence of background conditions in the measurement site has been determined for the period of study. These conditions, which constitute more than 80% of cases, are occasionally altered, mainly by high aerosols loading, as a consequence of biomass-burning events. Biomass-burning periods cover every year from mid-July to mid-October. The identification of these periods has been possible through the classification of aerosols in 6 subtypes. The month with the maximum AOD monthly average is September, and in 2016, the absolute maximum value of 0.91 was registered. The mean AOD value for the study period is 0.10 Â± 0.07 and the alpha mean value is 1.49 Â± 0.36, indicating presence, of small size aerosols. Some aerosol optical properties were analyzed in order to validate the aerosol classification. The aerosol size distribution revealed a bimodal character with a slight predominance of the fine mode, related to the two main types of aerosols: continental and biomass. Â© 2019",
Characterization of the chemical components and bioreactivity of fine particulate matter produced during crop-residue burning in China,"Five types of crop residue (rice, wheat, corn, sorghum, and sugarcane) collected from different provinces in China were used to characterize the chemical components and bioreactivity properties of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions during open-burning scenarios. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were the most abundant components, contributing 41.7%â€“54.9% of PM2.5 emissions. The OC/EC ratio ranged from 8.8 to 31.2, indicating that organic matter was the dominant component of emissions. Potassium and chloride were the most abundant components in the portion of PM2.5 composed of water-soluble ions. The coefficient of divergence ranged from 0.27 to 0.51 among various emissions profiles. All samples exposed to a high PM2.5 concentration (150 Î¼g/mL) exhibited a significant reduction in cell viability (A549 lung alveolar epithelial cells) and increase in lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and interleukin 6 levels compared with those exposed to 20 or 0 Î¼g/mL. Higher bioreactivity (determined according to LDH and interleukin 6 level) was observed for the rice, wheat, and corn samples than for the sorghum straw samples. Pearson's correlation analysis suggested that OC, heavy metals (chromium, manganese, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, and barium), and water-soluble ions (fluoride, calcium, and sulfate) are the components potentially associated with LDH production. The PM2.5 components emitted during biomass burning were characterized and proved to be correlated with oxidative and inflammatory responses in A549 cells. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",
Simulated polarization as a signature of aerosol type,"We present a technique for determining aerosol type using simulated values of degree of linear polarization as a function of scattering angle. The simulated polarization is determined from retrieved values of the indices of refraction and size parameters as determined from AERONET data sets for aerosols at various sites which we characterize as Urban/Industrial, Biomass-burning, Dust, Maritime and Mixed. We find that each type of aerosol has a characteristic simulated polarization â€œsignatureâ€. The calculated simulated degree of polarization for a particular aerosol observation is compared with a set of standard simulated polarizations using the Frechet distance between the curves. The aerosol type is given by the minimum Frechet distance. We emphasize that the simulated polarization is not the same as the measured polarization. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
High-time-resolution source apportionment of PM2.5 in Beijing with multiple models,"Beijing has suffered from heavy local emissions as well as regional transport of air pollutants, resulting in severe atmospheric fine-particle (PM2.5) pollution. This study developed a combined method to investigate source types of PM2.5 and its source regions during winter 2016 in Beijing, which include the receptor model (positive matrix factorization, PMF), footprint and an air quality model. The PMF model was performed with high-time-resolution measurements of trace elements, water soluble ions, organic carbon and elemental carbon using online instruments during the wintertime campaign of the Air Pollution and Human Health in a Chinese Megacity-Beijing (APHH-Beijing) program in 2016. Source types and their contributions estimated by PMF model using online measurements were linked with source regions identified by the footprint model, and the regional transport contribution was estimated by an air quality model (the Nested Air Quality Prediction Model System, NAQPMS) to analyze the specific sources and source regions during haze episodes. Our results show that secondary and biomass-burning sources were dominated by regional transport, while the coal combustion source increased with local contribution, suggesting that strict control strategies for local coal combustion in Beijing and a reduction of biomass-burning and gaseous precursor emissions in surrounding areas were essential to improve air quality in Beijing. The combination of PMF with footprint results revealed that secondary sources were mainly associated with southern footprints (53 %). The northern footprint was characterized by a high dust source contribution (11 %), while industrial sources increased with the eastern footprint (10 %). The results demonstrated the power of combining receptor model-based source apportionment with other models in understanding the formation of haze episodes and identifying specific sources from different source regions affecting air quality in Beijing.

"Classification of aerosols using multiple clustering techniques over Zanjan, Iran, during 2010-2014","A more detailed study and identification of aerosol types can help to better understand the sources and effects of aerosols. In the present study, a number of optical properties of aerosols have been investigated seasonal for discrimination of aerosol types during 2010-2014 over Zanjan, Iran. Also using AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data, aerosol was classified by multiple clustering techniques. Both fine and coarse modes particles were seen in seasonal averaged of Aerosol Volume Size Distribution (AVSD). Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) variations indicate the presence of scattering aerosol like dust in the spring, summer and fall, and dominance of absorbing type aerosols in the winter. The maximum value of the phase function was observed in the summer and in small scattering angle which can be due to presence of coarse mode dust particles. The scatter plot of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) versus Angstrom Exponent (AE) is one of the most effective methods to find aerosol types. Extinction Angstrom exponent (EAE) versus SSA and EAE versus absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) are other ways to classification of aerosol types. Graphs show abundance of dust in the spring, summer and fall in Zanjan's atmosphere. Also presence of urban/industrial aerosols is in all seasons, especially in the fall and winter. In addition mixed aerosols exist in all seasons. On the other hand, no biomass burning aerosols found in Zanjan's atmosphere. Â© 2019 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",
Approaches for identifying PM2.5 source types and source areas at a remote background site of South China in spring,"The receptor model is an effectively and widely used tool for analyzing the source of PM2.5, and its development and improvement have always been focused and challenged. In this study, approaches of source analysis is applied and compared. The PM2.5 samples were collected in spring of 2015 at a remote background site of Weizhou, South China and were analyzed for water-soluble ions, trace metals, and sugars. The 28 measurement species were introduced into the positive matrix factorization (PMF) and a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model for inter-comparison of PM2.5 prediction. Results showed that the NMF model is a more robust tool to identify source types and source apportionment in the case of a small sample size (n = 31). In NMF, four source variants were obtained as dust (15.6%), biomass combustion (11.8%), secondary formation (17.6%), and coal combustion (54.9%), corresponding to four main source areas. These were Southeast Asia, South China Sea, Taiwan Strait, as well as Pearl River Delta, respectively. The areas were distinguished based on hybrid receptor models, potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT), by introducing the daily loadings of each source factor from NMF method. These model results were highly consistent with categorized chemical characteristics of PM2.5, suggesting that NMF linking with hybrid receptor models provides valuable implications for exploring source types and source areas of PM2.5. Meanwhile, biomass combustion and coal combustion comparably contributed to the high PM2.5 concentrations indicating control strategy in South China in spring. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",
Source apportionment for online dataset at a megacity in China using a new PTT-PMF model,"Air pollution negatively impact human health and the environment. Source apportionment is an important research method for designing effective air pollution control policies. In this study, a new PTT-PMF (Partial Target Transformation-Positive matrix factor) source apportionment method (based on Multilinear Engine 2 program) was developed, to better recognize the extracted source categories, for online dataset. By incorporating measured source profiles, this model can automatically extract factors that have physical significance and close to actual source profiles. The accuracy of the PTT-PMF method was first evaluated by using several artificial datasets, and the results were favorable. Results of the new model can better explain similar sources such as dust and coal combustion (when lack of markers such as Ai and Si), comparing with the base run obtained using PMF. Then, this model was applied to online measurement data collected in Tianjin, China. Six factors were obtained and they were close to actual source profiles: dust (6.06%), coal combustion (4.70%), secondary sulfate sources (26.36%), secondary nitrate sources (42.91%), vehicle exhaust (9.97%) and biomass burning & SOC (10.01%). Time series of source contributions can also help to identify the source categories. The work presented here may advance receptor modelling techniques and could also enhance the validity of source apportionment results. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",
Satellite-based identification of aerosol particle species using a 2D-space aerosol classification model,"The classification of aerosol types using remote sensing tools is crucial for improving our knowledge on the impacts of aerosol species on global and regional climate. Ground-based classification methods have proven useful though they are limited by discontinuous spatial observations of aerosol optical properties. As such, there is a need to develop methods in aerosol species identification using satellite data. In this study, a 2D-space model suitable for MODIS AOD bands is developed to distinguish aerosol particle species based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol relative optical depth (AROD). The model can be used to classify five aerosol types, including biomass burning (BB: AOD470 â‰¥ 0.45, AROD660/470 < 0.58), urban industry (UI: AOD470 â‰¥ 0.45, 0.68 > AROD660/470 â‰¥ 0.58), sub-continental (SB: AOD470 â‰¥ 0.45, 0.91 > AROD660/470 â‰¥ 0.68), desert dust (DD: AROD660/470 â‰¥ 0.91) and continental (CO: AOD470 < 0.45, AROD660/470 < 0.91). AROD values corresponding to different types of aerosols are calculated through Mie scattering theory using the aerosol particle size distribution parameters and spectral complex refractive index. The accuracy and applicability of the model are verified in three steps: 1) we compare aerosol discrimination results of model with ground-based data and the local atmospheric conditions over different regions, 2) we compare aerosol identification results from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD retrieval and ground-based data, and 3) we test our model to validate its use in individual cases studies and regional observations. Our results demonstrate that aerosol species classification for each study region is consistent with the characteristics of their atmospheric conditions, and the classification results using MODIS AOD retrieval are similar to the ground-based observation results. The differences in MODIS versus AERONET AOD, caused by MODIS observation errors, is the major contributor to the differences between ground-based and satellite-based recognition results. Our three-steps validation results indicate that the 2D-space model developed in this paper can accurately identify different types of aerosols and has strong applicability. This provides a basis for the use of satellite data for continuous spatial identification of aerosol type, which greatly promotes research in related fields. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
Aerosol optical properties over an urban site in central China determined using ground-based sun photometer measurements,"                             Sun photometer measurements taken in urban Jiaozuo in central China from July 2016 to February 2018 were used to investigate the aerosol optical and microphysical properties, including the climatological variation in properties, the types of aerosols and the properties during haze and dust events. The mean annual aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD                             440 nm                             ) and the Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (AE                             440-870 nm                             ) were 0.84 Â± 0.55 and 1.12 Â± 0.17, respectively. The highest AOD occurred in summer, which may be associated with the hygroscopic growth of aerosols during enhanced relative humidity. Accordingly, a high volume of fine-mode particles was observed during this season. In addition, carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning increased the volume of fine particles in June and September, but coarse-mode particles (mainly dust) dominated during spring, especially in May, with a maximum volume of 0.16 Âµm                             3                              Âµm                             â€“2                             . At 440 nm, the mean seasonal single scattering albedo (SSA                             440 nm                             ) was lower in spring (0.87 Â± 0.05) and higher in summer (0.95 Â± 0.04), whereas the absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD                             440 nm                             ) displayed the opposite pattern, being higher in spring (0.079 Â± 0.019) and lower in summer (0.045 Â± 0.021). The increased absorptivity in spring and the strong scattering ability in summer of aerosols in this area may be related to particles originating from different sources. Using the method of classification based on the fine-mode fraction (FMF), SSA and AE, absorbing aerosols, both fine and mixed, were identified as the predominant type of particulate matter. The site was influenced not only by anthropogenic aerosols from local emissions and the surrounding regions but also by dust from northwestern China. The mean AOD and AE were 1.66 and 1.38 on hazy days, while a slightly low AOD of 0.95 and an extremely low AE of 0.18 were exhibited on dusty days. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of aerosol properties in this area, and the results will help to optimize the satellite aerosol inversion algorithm and promote regional climate change research.

"The role of biomass burning agricultural emissions in the Indo-Gangetic Plains on the air quality in New Delhi, India","Agricultural residue burning in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) releases large amounts of reactive nitrogen, among other pollutants, into the atmosphere each year. This study focuses on rice paddy residue burning and wheat residue burning during Octoberâ€“November and Aprilâ€“May, respectively, in 2016 and 2017. Emissions of reactive nitrogen species (ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx = NO + NO2)) were estimated for the study period using a suite of satellite products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aqua and Terra satellites. Emissions were compared against ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in New Delhi, India, to help determine the impact that these agricultural burns have on PM2.5, which is known to have numerous health and environmental impacts associated with prolonged exposure to elevated concentrations. Daily average measured concentrations of PM2.5 in New Delhi range from 22.43 Î¼g mâˆ’3 to 718.94 Î¼g mâˆ’3 (average 127.15 Î¼g mâˆ’3 Â± 95.23 Î¼g mâˆ’3), with the daily average PM2.5 concentration exceeding the national ambient air quality standard of 60 Î¼g mâˆ’3 approximately 75% of the time. Concentrations of PM2.5 were found to peak during Octoberâ€“November, which corresponds with rice paddy residue burning in the IGP. In addition to this, statistical regression models were created to predict average daily PM2.5 concentrations in New Delhi, India, based on emissions of NH3 and organic carbon (OC) in the IGP as well as meteorological conditions. The regression model predicted ambient PM2.5 concentrations ranging from 35 to 719 Î¼g mâˆ’3. The average modeled concentrations of PM2.5 in New Delhi, India, were 111 Î¼g mâˆ’3 (standard deviation: Â± 23 Î¼g mâˆ’3) during April/May and 207 Â± 87 Î¼g mâˆ’3 during October/November. Both regression models (for wheat residue burning and for rice paddy residue burning) were comparable to the average observations (normalized mean bias less than 0.1%). Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
Exposure assessment of pulmonary functions of school going children due to agriculture crop residue burning practice in Indo-Gangetic plains of India,"Agriculture crop residue burning is a serious issue in Northern India due to ineffective control policies. An epidemiological study has been done on school going children to evaluate the trends in their physiological parameters due to crop residue burning activity in the affected area. Total 600 children were recruited and continuously inspected for three years at three different sites. Season wise, the level of fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) was higher in rice crop residue burning seasons than in wheat crop residue burning seasons. As per doseâ€“response relationship, maximum degradation was observed in FVC (âˆ’7.62%) and PEF (âˆ’6.23%) parameters from their baseline values due to burning activities. With adjustment of socioeconomic, anthropometric parameters of selected subjects and meteorological parameters in multivariate mixed effect model, prediction equations have been purposed to observe the future trends in physiological parameters of children. Based on Tiffenue index, an unrecoverable effect has been observed in lung parameters. Trends were alarming and may cause serious complications in early age of human subjects.

"Concentration level, distribution model, source analysis, and ecological risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sediments from laizhou bay, China","To master the distribution patterns and environmental risk of 16 USEPA preferential polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments from Laizhou Bay, 20 samples were collected and investigated in this survey. The average PAH concentration in these sediments ranged from 268.97 ng/g to 895.37 ng/g with an average of 612.52 ng/g, thereby suggesting a relatively low PAH pollution in Laizhou Bay compared with other bays in the world. Tricyclic PAHs account for 79% of the total PAH content and were eventually identified as the most crucial component of these sediments. The PCAâ€“MLR results identify fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning, and coke oven as the main sources of PAHs that account for 26.69%, 67.16%, and 6.15% of the total PAH concentration in the collected sediments, respectively. The effect range low/effect range median (ERL/ERM) reveal the low toxicity of PAHs in these sediments. However, the concentration of Fle at each survey site exceeds the ERL level. Meanwhile, the mean effects rangeâ€“median quotient (M-ERM-Q) indicates the low level of ecological risk of PAHs in the surface sediments from Laizhou Bay. However, the contingency risk of Fle and Phe cannot be ruled out. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",
Amazonian Biomass Burning Enhances Tropical Andean Glaciers Melting,"The melting of tropical glaciers provides water resources to millions of people, involving social, ecological and economic demands. At present, these water reservoirs are threatened by the accelerating rates of mass loss associated with modern climate changes related to greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately land use/cover change. Until now, the effects of land use/cover change on the tropical Andean glaciers of South America through biomass burning activities have not been investigated. In this study, we quantitatively examine the hypothesis that regional land use/cover change is a contributor to the observed glacier mass loss, taking into account the role of Amazonian biomass burning. We demonstrated here, for the first time, that for tropical Andean glaciers, a massive contribution of black carbon emitted from biomass burning in the Amazon Basin does exist. This is favorable due to its positioning with respect to Amazon Basin fire hot spots and the predominant wind direction during the transition from the dry to wet seasons (Aug-Sep-Oct), when most fire events occur. We investigated changes in Bolivian Zongo Glacier albedo due to impurities on snow, including black carbon surface deposition and its potential for increasing annual glacier melting. We showed that the magnitude of the impact of Amazonian biomass burning depends on the dust content in snow. When high concentration of dust is present (e.g. 100 ppm of dust), the dust absorbs most of the radiation that otherwise would be absorbed by the BC. Our estimations point to a melting factor of 3.3 Â± 0.8% for black carbon, and 5.0 Â± 1.0% for black carbon in the presence of low dust content (e.g. 10 ppm of dust). For the 2010 hydrological year, we reported an increase in runoff corresponding to 4.5% of the annual discharge during the seasonal peak fire season, which is consistent with our predictions.

"A decade of aerosol optical properties measurements over athens, Greece","Long-term ground-based measurements of aerosol optical properties in Athens, Greece, for the period 2008-2018 performed by the National Observatory of Athens are used in order to investigate the aerosol climatology of the area. In this study, we utilize quality-assured measurements of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) and Angstrom exponent obtained by CIMEL photometers in the framework of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) to extract the seasonality and the trends of aerosols in the region. Higher aerosol loads are found during spring and summer months. A 1.1% per year decrease for AOD at 440 nm and 0.4% decrease per year for SSA during the studied period are recorded. Collocated and synchronous PM10 values, for a five-year period, are used in order to study ground-level conditions. Also, the Planetary Boundary Layer Height from ERA-5 is used to investigate the stratification of the particles. The classification of aerosols using AERONET data is performed to separate dust, biomass burning, polluted urban, marine and continental dominant aerosol mixtures. Also, the characterization of AOD provided by Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) is investigated. Finally, seasonal AOD trends recorded from AERONET from satellite sensors (MODIS-Aqua/MODIS-Terra) and estimated by CAMS are examined, and significant differences have been found.

Evaluating the diurnal cycle of South Atlantic stratocumulus clouds as observed by MSG SEVIRI,"Marine stratocumulus (Sc) clouds play an essential role in the earth radiation budget. Here, we compare liquid water path (LWP), cloud optical thickness, and cloud droplet effective radius (re) retrievals from 2 years of collocated Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) observations; estimate the effect of biomass burning smoke on passive imager retrievals; and evaluate the diurnal cycle of South Atlantic marine Sc clouds. The effect of absorbing aerosols from biomass burning on the retrievals was investigated using the aerosol index (AI) obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). SEVIRI and MODIS LWPs were found to decrease with increasing AI relative to TMI LWP, consistent with well-known negative visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) retrieval biases in and re. In the aerosol-affected months of July-August-September, SEVIRI LWP - based on the 1.6Î¼m re - was biased low by 14m'2 (1/4 16%) compared to TMI in overcast scenes, while MODIS LWP showed a smaller low bias of 4m'2 (1/4 5%) for the 1.6Î¼m channel and a high bias of 8m'2 (1/4 10%) for the 3.7Î¼m channel compared to TMI. Neglecting aerosol-affected pixels reduced the mean SEVIRI-TMI LWP bias considerably. For 2 years of data, SEVIRI LWP had a correlation with TMI and MODIS LWP of about 0.86 and 0.94, respectively, and biases of only 4-8m'2 (5%-10%) for overcast cases. The SEVIRI LWP diurnal cycle was in good overall agreement with TMI except in the aerosol-affected months. Both TMI and SEVIRI LWP decreased from morning to late afternoon, after which a slow increase was observed. Terra and Aqua MODIS mean LWPs also suggested a similar diurnal variation. The relative amplitude of the 2-year-mean and seasonal-mean LWP diurnal cycle varied between 35% and 40% from morning to late afternoon for overcast cases. The diurnal variation in SEVIRI LWP was mainly due to changes in, while re showed only little diurnal variability. Â© Author(s) 2018.",
Regression analysis of aerosol optical properties with long-term MODIS data using forward selection method,"In this work, a new filtering method of forward selection (FS), has been employed for linear and multiple regression analysis of aerosol optical properties with meteorological parameters using long-term moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for New Delhi area. Long-term observation (15Â years, March 2000â€“December 2014) of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550Â nm, fine mode fraction particles (FMF) and Angstrom exponent (AE) are analyzed to study their variability on annual and seasonal basis. The analysis reveals relatively high mean AOD (0.71 Â± 0.25), associated with moderate AE (0.69 Â± 0.13) for the overall period. Considerable higher values of AOD (0.89 Â± 0.33) were reported in monsoon and AE (0.87 Â± 0.10) during winter season. Likewise, seasonal fraction for AOD was also found to be higher (42%) during the monsoon season and for AE (31%) and for FMF (55%) during winter season. The peak value of AOD was during Juneâ€“July and the lowest in the transitional months of February and September, while AE was high in Januaryâ€“February and low in Mayâ€“June suggesting significant urban and biomass burning contribution. In general, the analysis shows a rather well-mixed type of aerosols present in the urban environment, which affect the regional air quality as well as climate associated with long-range transport of pollutants through the westerly winds from the Thar Desert and biomass burning in the western parts of India. The presence of AOD trend is evidence of air quality deterioration particularly in highly populated areas. The aerosol classification with relationship between AOD and alpha shows that urban/biomass burning aerosols are dominant in Delhi during winter and pre-monsoon. It is clearly seen that irrespective of constant emissions occurring each month, the estimated pollution is much higher in winter months and lower in summer months. It is concluded that fine particles exhibit much higher variations than urban aerosols annually and seasonally. Â© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",
Single-particle characterization of biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA): Evidence for non-uniform mixing of high molecular weight organics and potassium,"Biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) can be emitted from natural forest fires and human activities such as agricultural burning and domestic energy generation. BBOA is strongly associated with atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) that absorbs near-ultraviolet and visible light, resulting in significant impacts on regional visibility degradation and radiative forcing. The mixing state of BBOA can play a critical role in the prediction of aerosol optical properties. In this work, single-particle measurements from a Soot-Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer coupled with a light scattering module (LS-SP-AMS) were performed to examine the mixing state of BBOA, refractory black carbon (rBC), and potassium (K, a tracer for biomass burning aerosol) in an air mass influenced by wildfire emissions transported from northern QuÃ©bec to Toronto, representing aged biomass burning plumes. Cluster analysis of single-particle measurements identified five BBOA-related particle types. rBC accounted for 3-14 wt% of these particle types on average. Only one particle type exhibited a strong ion signal for K+, with mass spectra characterized by low molecular weight organic species. The remaining four particle types were classified based on the apparent molecular weight of the BBOA constituents. Two particle types were associated with low potassium content and significant amounts of high molecular weight (HMW) organic compounds. Our observations indicate non-uniform mixing of particles within a biomass burning plume in terms of molecular weight and illustrate that HMW BBOA can be a key contributor to low-volatility BrC observed in BBOA particles. The average mass absorption efficiency of low-volatility BBOA is about 0.8-1.1 m2g-1 based on a theoretical closure calculation. Our estimates indicate that low-volatility BBOA contributes âˆ¼ 33-44 % of thermo-processed particle absorption at 405nnm; and almost all of the BBOA absorption was associated with low-volatility organics.

Public perception of rural environmental quality: Moving towards a multi-pollutant approach,"Most environmental epidemiology studies have examined pollutants individually. Multi-pollutant approaches have been recognized recently, but to the extent of our knowledge, no study to date has specifically investigated exposures to multiple air pollutants in rural environments. In this paper we characterized and quantified residential exposures to air pollutant mixtures in rural populations, provided a better understanding of the relationships between air pollutant mixtures and annoyance responses to environmental stressors, particularly odor, and quantified their predictive abilities. We used validated and highly spatially resolved atmospheric modeling of 14 air pollutants for four rural areas of Denmark, and the annoyance responses considered were annoyance due to odor, noise, dust, smoke and vibrations. We found significant associations between odor annoyance and principal components predominantly described by nitrate (NO3âˆ’), ammonium (NH4+), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and NH3, which are usually related to agricultural emission sources. Among these components, NH3 showed the lowest error when comparing observed population data and predicted probabilities. The combination of these compounds in a predictive model resulted in the most accurate model, being able to correctly predict 66% of odor annoyance responses. Furthermore, noise annoyance was found to be significantly associated with traffic-related air pollutants. In general terms, our results suggest that emissions from the agricultural and livestock production sectors are the main contributors to environmental annoyance, but also identify traffic and biomass burning as potential sources of annoyance.

Associations between source-specific fine particulate matter and emergency department visits for respiratory disease in four U.S. cities,"Background: Short-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Determining which sources of PM2.5 are most toxic can help guide targeted reduction of PM2.5. However, conducting multicity epidemio-logic studies of sources is difficult because source-specific PM2.5 is not directly measured, and source chemical compositions can vary between cities. oBjectives: We determined how the chemical composition of primary ambient PM2.5 sources varies across cities. We estimated associations between source-specific PM2.5 and respiratory disease emergency department (ED) visits and examined between-city heterogeneity in estimated associations. Methods: We used source apportionment to estimate daily concentrations of primary source-specific PM2.5 for four U.S. cities. For sources with similar chemical compositions between cities, we applied Poisson time-series regression models to estimate associations between source-specific PM2.5 and respiratory disease ED visits. results: We found that PM2.5 from biomass burning, diesel vehicle, gasoline vehicle, and dust sources was similar in chemical composition between cities, but PM2.5 from coal combustion and metal sources varied across cities. We found some evidence of positive associations of respiratory disease ED visits with biomass burning PM2.5; associations with diesel and gasoline PM2.5 were frequently imprecise or consistent with the null. We found little evidence of associations with dust PM2.5. conclusions: We introduced an approach for comparing the chemical compositions of PM2.5 sources across cities and conducted one of the first multicity studies of source-specific PM2.5 and ED visits. Across four U.S. cities, among the primary PM2.5 sources assessed, biomass burning PM2.5 was most strongly associated with respiratory health.

Four-dimensional variational inversion of black carbon emissions during ARCTAS-CARB with WRFDA-Chem,"Biomass burning emissions of atmospheric aerosols, including black carbon, are growing due to increased global drought, and comprise a large source of uncertainty in regional climate and air quality studies. We develop and apply new incremental four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) capabilities in WRFDA-Chem to find optimal spatially and temporally distributed biomass burning (BB) and anthropogenic black carbon (BC) aerosol emissions. The constraints are provided by aircraft BC concentrations from the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites in collaboration with the California Air Resources Board (ARCTAS-CARB) field campaign and surface BC concentrations from the Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environment (IMPROVE) network on 22, 23, and 24 June 2008. We consider three BB inventories, including Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN) v1.0 and v1.5 and Quick Fire Emissions Database (QFED) v2.4r8. On 22 June, aircraft observations are able to reduce the spread between a customized QFED inventory and FINNv1.0 from a factor of 3. 5 ( Ã— 3. 5) to only Ã— 2. 1. On 23 and 24 June, the spread is reduced from Ã— 3. 4 to Ã— 1. 4. The posterior corrections to emissions are heterogeneous in time and space, and exhibit similar spatial patterns of sign for both inventories. The posterior diurnal BB patterns indicate that multiple daily emission peaks might be warranted in specific regions of California. The US EPA's 2005 National Emissions Inventory (NEI05) is used as the anthropogenic prior. On 23 and 24 June, the coastal California posterior is reduced by Ã— 2, where highway sources dominate, while inland sources are increased near Barstow by Ã— 5. Relative BB emission variances are reduced from the prior by up to 35 % in grid cells close to aircraft flight paths and by up to 60 % for fires near surface measurements. Anthropogenic variance reduction is as high as 40 % and is similarly limited to sources close to observations. We find that the 22 June aircraft observations are able to constrain approximately 14 degrees of freedom of signal (DOF), while surface and aircraft observations together on 23/24 June constrain 23 DOF. Improving hourly- to daily-scale concentration predictions of BC and other aerosols during BB events will require more comprehensive and/or targeted measurements and a more complete accounting of sources of error besides the emissions.

CALIOP near-real-time backscatter products compared to EARLINET data,"The expedited near-real-time Level 1.5 Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) version 3 products were evaluated against data from the ground-based European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET). The statistical framework and results of the three-year evaluation of 48 CALIOP overpasses with ground tracks within a 100 km distance from operating EARLINET stations are presented and include analysis for the following CALIOP classifications of aerosol type: dust, polluted dust, clean marine, clean continental, polluted continental, mixed and/or smoke/biomass burning. For the complete data set comprising both the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the free troposphere (FT) data, the correlation coefficient (R) was 0.86. When the analysis was conducted separately for the PBL and FT, the correlation coefficients were R = 0.6 and R = 0.85, respectively. From analysis of selected specific cases, it was initially thought that the presence of FT layers, with high attenuated backscatter, led to poor agreement of the PBL backscatter profiles between the CALIOP and EARLINET and prompted a further analysis to filter out such cases; however, removal of these layers did not improve the agreement as R reduced marginally from R = 0.86 to R = 0.84 for the combined PBL and FT analysis, increased marginally from R = 0.6 up to R = 0.65 for the PBL on its own, and decreased marginally from R = 0.85 to R = 0.79 for the FT analysis on its own. This suggests considerable variability, across the data set, in the spatial distribution of the aerosol over spatial scales of 100 km or less around some EARLINET stations rather than influence from elevated FT layers. For specific aerosol types, the correlation coefficient between CALIOP backscatter profiles and the EARLINET data ranged from R = 0.37 for polluted continental aerosol in the PBL to R = 0.57 for dust in the FT.

Model elucidating the sources and formation mechanisms of severe haze pollution over Northeast mega-city cluster in China,"Recent studies on regional haze pollution over China come up in general with strong variability of main causes of heavy polluted episodes, in linkage with local specificities, sources and pollution characteristics. This paper therefore aims at elucidating the main specific sources and formation mechanisms of observed strong haze pollution episodes over 1â€“15 November 2015 in Northeast region considered as one of biggest megacity clusters in China. The Northeast China mega-city cluster, including Heilong Jiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces, is adjacent to Russia in the north, Mongolian at the west, North Korea at east, and representing key geographical location in the regional and transnational air pollution issues in China due to the presence of heavy industries and intense economic activities. The present study, based on air quality monitoring, remote sensing satellite data and sensitivity experiments carried on the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS), quantitatively assesses the impact of meteorological conditions and potential contributions from regional chemical transport, intensive energy combustion, illegal emission and biomass burning emissions to PM2.5 concentration variation. The results indicate strong inversion occurrence at lower atmosphere with weak near-surface wind speed and high relative humidity, leading to PM2.5 concentration increase of about 30â€“50%. Intensive energy combustion (plausibly for heating activities) and illegal emission also significantly enhance the overall PM2.5 accumulation by 100â€“200 Î¼g mâˆ’3 (60â€“70% increase), against 75â€“100 Î¼g mâˆ’3 from the biomass burning under the northeast-southwest transport pathway, corresponding to a contribution of 10â€“20% to PM2.5 concentration increase. Obviously, stagnant meteorological conditions, energy combustion, illegal emission and biomass burning are main drivers of strong haze formation and spatial distribution over Northeast China megacity cluster. In clear, much effort on emission abatement at both local and regional scales is still an urgent imperative to overcome current critical haze pollution. Â© 2017 The Authors",
Weed Seed Wizard: A tool that demonstrates the value of integrated weed management tactics such as harvest weed seed destruction,"Harvest weed seed destruction (HWSD) can be included in an integrated weed management (IWM) program to help control weed populations and combat herbicide resistance. However, it may not be possible or practical to use this technique in every year. This research utilised a computer model, the Weed Seed Wizard, to investigate the impact of employing HWSD every second year. Data from a long term trial in Merredin Western Australia demonstrated the value of residue burning (an early method of HWSD) compared to residue retention on the destruction of Lolium rigidum seed from 2003 to 2013. The agronomic practices utilised in this trial, soil type and rainfall at the field site, and crop yield data were used to parametrise two scenarios in the model. Scenario 1 was based on data from the field trial plots where residue was retained and scenario 2 was based on data from the plots where residue was burnt (i.e. HWSD). A third hypothetical scenario was based on scenario 2, but only incorporated HWSD in every second year. The model gave reasonable predictions of L. rigidum seed production each year (when compared to the actual seed production in the field trial), and accurately predicted when L. rigidum seed numbers would reach very low levels in scenario 2, due to annual HWSD. Scenario 3 indicated that HWSD in every second year could not reduce L. rigidum seeds to the same extent as annual HWSD, but the L. rigidum population was reduced to and maintained at less than one plant mâˆ’2 at harvest within four years. The model indicated that the total cost of weeds ranged from $85 haâˆ’1 in scenario 1 to $32 and $27 haâˆ’1 in scenario 3 and 2. However, income was greatest in scenario 1 as HWSD via burning residue caused a yield reduction in scenario 2 and 3. The results highlight both the benefits of HWSD as a weed management tactic and the value of the Weed Seed Wizard as a tool to investigate different IWM programs. Â© 2018",
Secondary organic aerosol formation in biomass-burning plumes: Theoretical analysis of lab studies and ambient plumes,"Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) has been shown to form in biomass-burning emissions in laboratory and field studies. However, there is significant variability among studies in mass enhancement, which could be due to differences in fuels, fire conditions, dilution, and/or limitations of laboratory experiments and observations. This study focuses on understanding processes affecting biomass-burning SOA formation in laboratory smog-chamber experiments and in ambient plumes. Vapor wall losses have been demonstrated to be an important factor that can suppress SOA formation in laboratory studies of traditional SOA precursors; however, impacts of vapor wall losses on biomass-burning SOA have not yet been investigated. We use an aerosol-microphysical model that includes representations of volatility and oxidation chemistry to estimate the influence of vapor wall loss on SOA formation observed in the FLAME III smog-chamber studies. Our simulations with base-case assumptions for chemistry and wall loss predict a mean OA mass enhancement (the ratio of final to initial OA mass, corrected for particle-phase wall losses) of 1.8 across all experiments when vapor wall losses are modeled, roughly matching the mean observed enhancement during FLAME III. The mean OA enhancement increases to over 3 when vapor wall losses are turned off, implying that vapor wall losses reduce the apparent SOA formation. We find that this decrease in the apparent SOA formation due to vapor wall losses is robust across the ranges of uncertainties in the key model assumptions for wall-loss and mass-transfer coefficients and chemical mechanisms. We then apply similar assumptions regarding SOA formation chemistry and physics to smoke emitted into the atmosphere. In ambient plumes, the plume dilution rate impacts the organic partitioning between the gas and particle phases, which may impact the potential for SOA to form as well as the rate of SOA formation. We add Gaussian dispersion to our aerosol-microphysical model to estimate how SOA formation may vary under different ambient-plume conditions (e.g., fire size, emission mass flux, atmospheric stability). Smoke from small fires, such as typical prescribed burns, dilutes rapidly, which drives evaporation of organic vapor from the particle phase, leading to more effective SOA formation. Emissions from large fires, such as intense wildfires, dilute slowly, suppressing OA evaporation and subsequent SOA formation in the near field. We also demonstrate that different approaches to the calculation of OA enhancement in ambient plumes can lead to different conclusions regarding SOA formation. OA mass enhancement ratios of around 1 calculated using an inert tracer, such as black carbon or CO, have traditionally been interpreted as exhibiting little or no SOA formation; however, we show that SOA formation may have greatly contributed to the mass in these plumes. In comparison of laboratory and plume results, the possible inconsistency of OA enhancement between them could be in part attributed to the effect of chamber walls and plume dilution. Our results highlight that laboratory and field experiments that focus on the fuel and fire conditions also need to consider the effects of plume dilution or vapor losses to walls.

Comparative assessment of aerosol optical properties over a mega city and an adjacent urban area in India,"The present work revolves around the comparative analysis of aerosol optical properties in a mega city, Delhi and in a nearby urban area, Rohtak. It is pertinent to note that despite of the close proximity and similar meteorological conditions, the two study locations show significant differences in aerosol characteristics. The study is conducted using ground based Sky-radiometer measurements for a period of one year. The mean annual Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 500 nm over Delhi and Rohtak is observed to be 1.01 and 0.73 respectively, with correlation coefficient of 0.67 and mean absolute difference of 0.51. The magnitude of AOD in Delhi is higher than in Rohtak throughout the year, except in post-monsoon season. The difference in Angstrom exponent (alpha) between the stations is minimal. However, lower magnitude of alpha is observed in Rohtak, indicating presence of more concentration of coarse-mode particles. Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) also shows seasonal variation with significantly lower values in Delhi throughout the year, indicating contribution of absorbing type of aerosols (like black carbon). The volume concentration in fine-size is found to be higher in Delhi than in Rohtak, indicating combined effect of dust, vehicular, biomass burning and industrial emissions. The aerosol classification via relationship between AOD and alpha shows that urban/biomass burning (U/B) aerosols are dominant in Delhi and mixed type (MT) aerosols in Rohtak during winter and pre-monsoon.

Deriving High-Resolution Emission Inventory of Open Biomass Burning in China based on Satellite Observations,"Open biomass burning plays an important role in atmospheric pollution and in climate change. However, the current emission inventory of open biomass burning is generally of highly uncertainty because of missing small fire data and limited resolution because of the lack of localized vegetation data. In this study, the MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) burned area product MCD64Al combined with the active fire product MCD14 ML, as well as a high-resolution land cover data set, were applied to develop a high-resolution emission inventory of open biomass burning in China in 2013. Total CO, CH4, NOx, NMVOC (nonmethane volatile organic compounds), SO2, NH3, PM2.5, PM10, OC (organic carbon), BC (black carbon), and CO2 emissions were estimated to be 1.03 Ã— 104, 666, 536, 1.91 Ã— 103, 87, 138, 1.45 Ã— 103, 2.09 Ã— 103, 741, 137, and 2.45 Ã— 105 Gg, respectively. The provinces that contributed the most emissions included Heilongjiang, Henan, Shandong, and Jilin. The major source for all pollutants was cropland burning, whereas Xizang, Xinjiang, and Heilongjiang had greater emissions from natural vegetation. The temporal distribution of average provincial emissions showed that the peaks were in June and October. This study updated the emission information that may support future research and policy-making on air pollution control and GHG emission abatement. Â© 2016 American Chemical Society.",
Intra-urban biomonitoring: Source apportionment using tree barks to identify air pollution sources,"It is of great interest to evaluate if there is a relationship between possible sources and trace elements using biomonitoring techniques. In this study, tree bark samples of 171 trees were collected using a biomonitoring technique in the inner city of SÃ£o Paulo. The trace elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Cl, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Rb, S, Sr and Zn) were determined by the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to identify the plausible sources associated with tree bark measurements. The greatest source was vehicle-induced non-tailpipe emissions derived mainly from brakes and tires wear-out and road dust resuspension (characterized with Al, Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn), which was explained by 27.1% of the variance, followed by cement (14.8%), sea salt (11.6%) and biomass burning (10%), and fossil fuel combustion (9.8%). We also verified that the elements related to vehicular emission showed different concentrations at different sites of the same street, which might be helpful for a new street classification according to the emission source. The spatial distribution maps of element concentrations were obtained to evaluate the different levels of pollution in streets and avenues. Results indicated that biomonitoring techniques using tree bark can be applied to evaluate dispersion of air pollution and provide reliable data for the further epidemiological studies.

Deriving aerosol hygroscopic mixing state from size-resolved CCN activity and HR-ToF-AMS measurements,"The ability of a particle to uptake water and form a cloud droplet depends on its hygroscopicity. To understand its impact on cloud properties and ultimately radiative forcing, knowledge of chemically-resolved mixing state information or the one based on hygroscopic growth is crucial. Typically, global models assume either pure internal or external mixing state which might not be true for all conditions and sampling locations. To investigate into this, the current study employed an indirect approach to infer the probable mixing state. The hygroscopic parameters derived from Îº-Kohler theory using size-resolved CCN measurements (ÎºCCN) and bulk/size-resolved aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements (ÎºAMS) were compared. The accumulation mode particles were found to be more hygroscopic (ÎºCCNÂ =Â 0.24) than Aitken mode (ÎºCCNÂ =Â 0.13), perhaps due to increased ratio of inorganic to organic mass fraction. The activation diameter calculated from size-resolved CCN activity measurements at 5 different supersaturation (SS) levels varied in the range of 115Â nmâ€“42Â nm with ÎºCCNÂ =Â 0.13â€“0.23 (avgÂ =Â 0.18Â Â±Â 0.10 (Â±1Ïƒ)). Further, ÎºAMS> ÎºCCN was observed possibly due to the fact that organic and inorganic mass present in the Aitken mode was not correctly represented by bulk chemical composition and size-resolved fractional contribution of oxidized OA was not accurately accounted. Better correlation of organic fraction (forg) and ÎºCCN at lower SS explained this behaviour. The decrease in ÎºCCN with the time of the day was more pronounced at lower SS because of the relative mass reduction of soluble inorganic species by âˆ¼17%. Despite the large differences between Îº measured from two approaches, less over-prediction (up to 18%) between measured and predicted CCN concentration suggested lower impact of chemical composition and mixing state at higher SS. However, at lower SS, presences of externally mixed CCN-inactive aerosols lead to CCN over-prediction reflecting the significance of aerosol mixing state information. Further examination of the effect of biomass burning aerosols (âˆ¼35% in least oxidized biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA-2 fraction) on hygroscopicity and CCN activity showed increase in the concentration of all AMS measured species (except NH4+ and SO42âˆ’), less O:C ratio, and organic mass fraction (forg) peak shift to lower diameter range caused âˆ¼13% change in critical diameter (Da) and âˆ¼40% change in ÎºCCN. Increased deviation of âˆ¼100% between ÎºCCN and ÎºAMS due to sudden influx of internally mixed BBOA caused suppressed hygroscopic growth. This study finally suggests the assumption of pure internally mixed aerosol does not completely hold true for this anthropogenically polluted site. Â© 2016",
Aerosol climatology over the Mexico City basin: Characterization of optical properties,"Climatology of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), and aerosol particle-size distribution were analyzed using a 15-year (1999â€“2014) dataset from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations over the Mexico City (MC) basin. The atmosphere over this site is dominated by two main aerosol types, represented by urban/industrial pollution and biomass-burning particles. Due to the specific meteorological conditions within the basin, seasons are usually classified into three as follows: Dry Winter (DW) (Novemberâ€“February); Dry Spring (DS) (Marchâ€“April), and the RAiny season (RA) (Mayâ€“October), which are mentioned throughout this article. Using a CIMEL sun photometer, we conducted continuous observations over the MC urban area from January 1999 to December 2014. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (Î±440â€“870), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), and aerosol particle-size distribution were derived from the observational data. The overall mean AOD500 during the 1999â€“2014 period was 0.34 Â± 0.07. The monthly mean AOD reached a maximal value of 0.49 in May and a minimal value of 0.27 in February and March. The average Î±440â€“870 value for the period studied was 1.50 Â± 0.16. The monthly average of Î±440â€“870 reached a minimal value of 1.32 in August and a maximal value of 1.61 in May. Average SSA at 440 nm was 0.89 throughout the observation period, indicating that aerosols over Mexico City are composed mainly of absorptive particles. Concentrations of fine- and coarse-mode aerosols over MC were highest in DS season compared with other seasons, especially for particles with radii measuring between 0.1 and 0.2 Î¼m. Results from the Spectral De-convolution Algorithm (SDA) show that fine-mode aerosols dominated AOD variability in MC. In the final part of this article, we present a classification of aerosols in MC by using the graphical method proposed by Gobbi et al. (2007), which is based on the combined analysis of Î± and its spectral curvature Î´Î±. Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.",
In vitro toxicity and epigenotoxicity of different types of ambient particulate matter,"Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) has been associated with adverse health effects, including pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Studies indicate that ambient PM originated from different sources may cause distinct biological effects. In this study, we sought to investigate the potential of various types of PM to cause epigenetic alterations in the in vitro system. RAW264.7 murine macrophages were exposed for 24 and 72 h to 5- and 50-Î¼g/ml doses of the water soluble extract of 6 types of PM: soil dust, road dust, agricultural dust, traffic exhausts, biomass burning, and pollen, collected in January-April of 2014 in the area of Little Rock, Arkansas. Cytotoxicity, oxidative potential, epigenetic endpoints, and chromosomal aberrations were addressed. Exposure to 6 types of PM resulted in induction of cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in a type-, time-, and dose-dependent manner. Epigenetic alterations were characterized by type-, time-, and dose-dependent decreases of DNA methylation/demethylation machinery, increased DNA methyltransferases enzymatic activity and protein levels, and transcriptional activation and subsequent silencing of transposable elements LINE-1, SINE B1/B2. The most pronounced changes were observed after exposure to soil dust that were also characterized by hypomethylation and reactivation of satellite DNA and structural chromosomal aberrations in the exposed cells. The results of our study indicate that the water-soluble fractions of the various types of PM have differential potential to target the cellular epigenome. Â© The Author 2015.

Identification of aerosol types over an urban site based on air-mass trajectory classification,"Columnar aerosol properties retrieved from MICROTOPS II Sun Photometer measurements during 2010-2013 over Pune (18Â°32'N; 73Â°49'E, 559m amsl), a tropical urban station in India, are analyzed to identify aerosol types in the atmospheric column. Identification/classification is carried out on the basis of dominant airflow patterns, and the method of discrimination of aerosol types on the basis of relation between aerosol optical depth (AOD500nm) and Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (AE, Î±). Five potential advection pathways viz., NW/N, SW/S, N, SE/E and L have been identified over the observing site by employing the NOAA-HYSPLIT air mass back trajectory analysis. Based on AE against AOD500nm scatter plot and advection pathways followed five major aerosol types viz., continental average (CA), marine continental average (MCA), urban/industrial and biomass burning (UB), desert dust (DD) and indeterminate or mixed type (MT) have been identified. In winter, sector SE/E, a representative of air masses traversed over Bay of Bengal and Eastern continental Indian region has relatively small AOD (Ï„pÎ»=0.43Â±0.13) and high AE (Î±=1.19Â±0.15). These values imply the presence of accumulation/sub-micron size anthropogenic aerosols. During pre-monsoon, aerosols from the NW/N sector have high AOD (Ï„pÎ»=0.61Â±0.21), and low AE (Î±=0.54Â±0.14) indicating an increase in the loading of coarse-mode particles over Pune. Dominance of UB type in winter season for all the years (i.e. 2010-2013) may be attributed to both local/transported aerosols. During pre-monsoon seasons, MT is the dominant aerosol type followed by UB and DD, while the background aerosols are insignificant. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.",
The importance of plume rise on the concentrations and atmospheric impacts of biomass burning aerosol,"We quantified the effects of the plume rise of biomass burning aerosol and gases for the forest fires that occurred in Saskatchewan, Canada, in July 2010. For this purpose, simulations with different assumptions regarding the plume rise and the vertical distribution of the emissions were conducted. Based on comparisons with observations, applying a one-dimensional plume rise model to predict the injection layer in combination with a parametrization of the vertical distribution of the emissions outperforms approaches in which the plume heights are initially predefined. Approximately 30 % of the fires exceed the height of 2 km with a maximum height of 8.6 km. Using this plume rise model, comparisons with satellite images in the visible spectral range show a very good agreement between the simulated and observed spatial distributions of the biomass burning plume. The simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) with data of an AERONET station is in good agreement with respect to the absolute values and the timing of the maximum. Comparison of the vertical distribution of the biomass burning aerosol with CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) retrievals also showed the best agreement when the plume rise model was applied. We found that downwelling surface short-wave radiation below the forest fire plume is reduced by up to 50 % and that the 2 m temperature is decreased by up to 6 K. In addition, we simulated a strong change in atmospheric stability within the biomass burning plume. Â© Author(s) 2016.",
"Comparison of Aerosol Optical Properties Between Two Nearby Urban Sites in Beijing, China","This study compares the aerosol optical properties measured by CE318 sunphotometers at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics and the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences in Beijing between January 2013 and July 2015 to provide the framework to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of aerosol properties. Aerosol optical parameters included extinction (scattering plus absorption) aerosol optical depth (EAOD), extinction Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (EAE), columnar water vapor (CWV), absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD), absorption Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (AAE), extinction aerosol optical depth of fine particles (EAODf), extinction aerosol optical depth of coarse particles (EAODc), real parts of the refractive index (REFR), imaginary parts of the refractive index (REFI), single scattering albedo (SSA), asymmetry factor (ASYM), size distribution, and sphericity fraction. Comparison of aerosol optical properties using the simultaneous observations between two sites showed that correlation coefficients were larger than or equal to 0.98 for EAOD, EAE, and CWV, but smaller than or equal to 0.90 for AAOD, REFR, REFI, and SSA; the percentage differences for most of the parameters were less than 2%, but for EAODf were relatively large, ranging from 4.35 to 6.45%; the mean size distributions simultaneously showed bi-modal patterns, with two peak volumes at the radii of 0.15 and 2.94 Î¼m; two kinds of tri-peak model were apparent during the study period; a case of EAODs at 440Â nm differing by more than 0.2 between the two sites reflected the effect of local aerosol pollution. Comparison of aerosol characterization inferred by absorption properties using all the inversion data showed that classification using EAE, AAE, and sphericity fraction indicated the main aerosol type was â€œU/I&BBâ€ (urban/industrial and biomass-burning), accounting for 59.87 and 57.43%, respectively; the volume size distribution retrievals binned by AAE exhibited coarse mode particles became dominant as AAE increased to 2.0; the SSA retrievals binned by AAE demonstrated SSA transitioned from spectra representing dust to U/I&BB pollution; averaged SSA for all the retrievals and SSA data partitioned by the EAE and Î·675Â nm suggested there were more absorbing aerosols at IAP. The results of the study will be beneficial in validating satellite observations and model simulation results, providing more accurate input parameters for model simulations.

"Classification of key aerosol types and their frequency distributions based on satellite remote sensing data at an industrially polluted city in the Yangtze River Delta, China","In the present study, characterization of columnar aerosol optical properties and classifying the major aerosol types was investigated at an urbanâ€“industrial city, Nanjing in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region over East China using simultaneous data sets retrieved from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) sensors during 2004â€“2015. A notable spatiotemporal heterogeneity was observed in the optical properties of aerosols on the seasonal scale over East China. Aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD550) exhibited pronounced seasonal variability over Nanjing in the YRD, with higher values during summer and spring seasons and lower in winter. Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (AE470â€“660) found higher in summer indicating the relative abundance of fine mode aerosols over the coarse mode. We also used the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model for presenting cluster trajectory analysis which revealed that the airmasses from different source regions contributed greatly to aerosol loading during the study period. In addition, we followed two techniques for studying classification of major aerosol types based on the predefined thresholds. Using the AODâ€“AE method (here called as Technique-I), five major aerosol types were identified via, continental clean (CC), marine (MA), biomass burning/urbanâ€“industrial (BU), desert dust (DD), and mixed (MX). In all the seasons, MX is the dominant aerosol type followed by the BU and DD type aerosols during summer and spring seasons, respectively. Further, the sub-classification of aerosol types was carried out considering into account of the characteristics of absorbing aerosol index (AAI) (here called as Technique-II). The two clustering techniques showed reasonable consistency in the obtained results. The various aerosol types (absorbing and non-absorbing) and their change over a region are highly helpful in fine tuning the models to decrease the uncertainty in the radiative and climatic effects of aerosols.

Understanding sources of organic aerosol during CalNex-2010 using the CMAQ-VBS,"Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations utilizing the traditional organic aerosol (OA) treatment (CMAQ-AE6) and a volatility basis set (VBS) treatment for OA (CMAQ-VBS) were evaluated against measurements collected at routine monitoring networks (Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) and Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE)) and those collected during the 2010 California at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) field campaign to examine important sources of OA in southern California.<br><br> Traditionally, CMAQ treats primary organic aerosol (POA) as nonvolatile and uses a two-product framework to represent secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. CMAQ-VBS instead treats POA as semivolatile and lumps OA using volatility bins spaced an order of magnitude apart. The CMAQ-VBS approach underpredicted organic carbon (OC) at IMPROVE and CSN sites to a greater degree than CMAQ-AE6 due to the semivolatile POA treatment. However, comparisons to aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements collected at Pasadena, CA, indicated that CMAQ-VBS better represented the diurnal profile and primary/secondary split of OA. CMAQ-VBS SOA underpredicted the average measured AMS oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA, a surrogate for SOA) concentration by a factor of 5.2, representing a considerable improvement to CMAQ-AE6 SOA predictions (factor of 24 lower than AMS).<br><br> We use two new methods, one based on species ratios (SOA/i""CO and SOA/O<i>x</i>) and another on a simplified SOA parameterization, to apportion the SOA underprediction for CMAQ-VBS to slow photochemical oxidation (estimated as 1.5 Ã— lower than observed at Pasadena using Ä'log(NO<i>x</i>Äâ‚¬:Äâ‚¬NO<i>y</i>)), low intrinsic SOA formation efficiency (low by 1.6 to 2 Ã— for Pasadena), and low emissions or excessive dispersion for the Pasadena site (estimated to be 1.6 to 2.3 Ã— too low/excessive). The first and third factors are common to CMAQ-AE6, while the intrinsic SOA formation efficiency for that model is estimated to be too low by about 7 Ã— .<br><br> From source-apportioned model results, we found most of the CMAQ-VBS modeled POA at the Pasadena CalNex site was attributable to meat cooking emissions (48 %, consistent with a substantial fraction of cooking OA in the observations). This is compared to 18 % from gasoline vehicle emissions, 13 % from biomass burning (in the form of residential wood combustion), and 8 % from diesel vehicle emissions. All ""other"" inventoried emission sources (e.g., industrial, point, and area sources) comprised the final 13 %. The CMAQ-VBS semivolatile POA treatment underpredicted AMS hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) + cooking-influenced OA (CIOA) at Pasadena by a factor of 1.8 compared to a factor of 1.4 overprediction of POA in CMAQ-AE6, but it did capture the AMS diurnal profile of HOA and CIOA well, with the exception of the midday peak.<br><br> Overall, the CMAQ-VBS with its semivolatile treatment of POA, SOA from intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs), and aging of SOA improves SOA model performance (though SOA formation efficiency is still 1.6-2 Ã— too low). However, continued efforts are needed to better understand assumptions in the parameterization (e.g., SOA aging) and provide additional certainty to how best to apply existing emission inventories in a framework that treats POA as semivolatile, which currently degrades existing model performance at routine monitoring networks. The VBS and other approaches (e.g., AE6) require additional work to appropriately incorporate IVOC emissions and subsequent SOA formation. Â© 2016 Author(s). CC Attribution 3.0 License.",
Single-particle characterizations of ambient aerosols during a wintertime pollution episode in nanning: Local emissions vs. regional transport,"Ambient aerosol during a heavily polluted episode in wintertime was characterized using real-time single particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS) in urban Nanning, a capital city in the Southwestern China. More than two million individual particles analyzed by SPAMS were classified into 8 major clusters based on the mass spectral patterns. A group of vanadium-rich particles were identified as the emissions from mining and smelting of vanadium mineral and were taken as markers of regional transported industrial emissions when air masses traversed northeast inland regions from Nanning. Number fractions of other industrially-emitted particles, including chromium-rich, elemental/organic carbon, organic carbon and fly ash, also increased during the regional transport events. During stagnant periods, local emissions sources, including vehicle exhaust (like Ca-EC particles) and local coal-fired power plants, contributed to the fine particles. During most of the sampling period, biomass burning particles produced by bagasse combustion were the most abundant, contributing ~25â€“ 80% of the total classified particles. Our observations suggest that biomass burning particles derived from industrial heat and electricity cogeneration processes could have a significant impact on the urban air quality without proper emission controls.

An AERONET-based aerosol classification using the Mahalanobis distance,"We present an aerosol classification based on AERONET aerosol data from 1993 to 2012. We used the AERONET Level 2.0 almucantar aerosol retrieval products to define several reference aerosol clusters which are characteristic of the following general aerosol types: Urban-Industrial, Biomass Burning, Mixed Aerosol, Dust, and Maritime. The classification of a particular aerosol observation as one of these aerosol types is determined by its five-dimensional Mahalanobis distance to each reference cluster. We have calculated the fractional aerosol type distribution at 190 AERONET sites, as well as the monthly variation in aerosol type at those locations. The results are presented on a global map and individually in the supplementary material. Our aerosol typing is based on recognizing that different geographic regions exhibit characteristic aerosol types. To generate reference clusters we only keep data points that lie within a Mahalanobis distance of 2 from the centroid. Our aerosol characterization is based on the AERONET retrieved quantities, therefore it does not include low optical depth values. The analysis is based on ""point sources"" (the AERONET sites) rather than globally distributed values. The classifications obtained will be useful in interpreting aerosol retrievals from satellite borne instruments. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",
Emission factors from different burning stages of agriculture wastes in Mexico,"Open-air burning of agricultural wastes from crops like corn, rice, sorghum, sugar cane, and wheat is common practice in Mexico, which in spite limiting regulations, is the method to eliminate such wastes, to clear the land for further harvesting, to control grasses, weeds, insects, and pests, and to facilitate nutrient absorption. However, this practice generates air pollution and contributes to the greenhouse effect. Burning of straws derived from the said crops was emulated in a controlled combustion chamber, hence determining emission factors for particles, black carbon, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide throughout the process, which comprised three apparent stages: pre-ignition, flaming, and smoldering. In all cases, maximum particle concentrations were observed during the flaming stage, although the maximum final contributions to the particle emission factors corresponded to the smoldering stage. The comparison between particle size distributions (from laser spectrometer) and black carbon (from an aethalometer) confirmed that finest particles were emitted mainly during the flaming stage. Carbon dioxide emissions were also highest during the flaming stage whereas those of carbon monoxide were highest during the smoldering stage. Comparing the emission factors for each straw type with their chemical analyses (elemental, proximate, and biochemical), some correlations were found between lignin content and particle emissions and either particle emissions or duration of the pre-ignition stage. High ash or lignin containing-straw slowed down the pre-ignition and flaming stages, thus favoring CO oxidation to CO2. Â© 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",
"Aerosol properties, source identification, and cloud processing in orographic clouds measured by single particle mass spectrometry on a central European mountain site during HCCT-2010","Cloud residues and out-of-cloud aerosol particles with diameters between 150 and 900gnm were analysed by online single particle aerosol mass spectrometry during the 6-week study Hill Cap Cloud Thuringia (HCCT)-2010 in September-October 2010. The measurement location was the mountain SchmÃ¼cke (937gmga.s.l.) in central Germany. More than 160g000 bipolar mass spectra from out-of-cloud aerosol particles and more than 13g000 bipolar mass spectra from cloud residual particles were obtained and were classified using a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. Analysis of the uncertainty of the sorting algorithm was conducted on a subset of the data by comparing the clustering output with particle-by-particle inspection and classification by the operator. This analysis yielded a false classification probability between 13 and 48g%. Additionally, particle types were identified by specific marker ions. <br><br> The results from the ambient aerosol analysis show that 63g% of the analysed particles belong to clusters having a diurnal variation, suggesting that local or regional sources dominate the aerosol, especially for particles containing soot and biomass burning particles. In the cloud residues, the relative percentage of large soot-containing particles and particles containing amines was found to be increased compared to the out-of-cloud aerosol, while, in general, organic particles were less abundant in the cloud residues. In the case of amines, this can be explained by the high solubility of the amines, while the large soot-containing particles were found to be internally mixed with inorganics, which explains their activation as cloud condensation nuclei. Furthermore, the results show that during cloud processing, both sulfate and nitrate are added to the residual particles, thereby changing the mixing state and increasing the fraction of particles with nitrate and/or sulfate. This is expected to lead to higher hygroscopicity after cloud evaporation, and therefore to an increase of the particles' ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei after their cloud passage.

Characterization of aerosol episodes in the greater Mediterranean Sea area from satellite observations (2000-2007),"An algorithm able to identify and characterize episodes of different aerosol types above sea surfaces of the greater Mediterranean basin (GMB), including the Black Sea and the Atlantic Ocean off the coasts of Iberia and northwest Africa, is presented in this study. Based on this algorithm, five types of intense (strong and extreme) aerosol episodes in the GMB are identified and characterized using daily aerosol optical properties from satellite measurements, namely MODIS-Terra, Earth Probe (EP)-TOMS and OMI-Aura. These aerosol episodes are: (i) biomass-burning/urban-industrial (BU), (ii) desert dust (DD), (iii) dust/sea-salt (DSS), (iv) mixed (MX) and (v) undetermined (UN). The identification and characterization is made with our algorithm using a variety of aerosol properties, namely aerosol optical depth (AOD), Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (Î±), fine fraction (FF), effective radius (reff) and Aerosol Index (AI).During the study period (2000-2007), the most frequent aerosol episodes are DD, observed primarily in the western and central Mediterranean Sea, and off the northern African coasts, 7 times/year for strong episodes and 4 times/year for extreme ones, on average. The DD episodes yield 40% of all types of strong aerosol episodes in the study region, while they account for 71.5% of all extreme episodes. The frequency of occurrence of strong episodes exhibits specific geographical patterns, for example the BU are mostly observed along the coasts of southern Europe and off the Atlantic coasts of Portugal, the MX episodes off the Spanish Mediterranean coast and over the Adriatic and northern Aegean Sea, while the DSS ones over the western and central Mediterranean Sea. On the other hand, the extreme episodes for all but DD aerosol display more patchy spatial patterns. The strong episodes exhibit AOD at 550 nm as high as 1.6 in the southernmost parts of central and eastern Mediterranean Sea, which rise up to 5 for the extreme, mainly DD and DSS, episodes. Although more than 90% of all aerosol episodes last 1 day, there are few cases, mainly extreme DD episodes, which last up to 4 days. Independently of their type, the Mediterranean aerosol episodes occur more frequently in spring (strong and extreme episodes) and summer (strong episodes) and most rarely during winter. A significant year by year variability of Mediterranean aerosol episodes has been identified, more in terms of their frequency than intensity. An analysis of 5-day back trajectories for the most extreme episodes provides confidence on the obtained results of the algorithm, based on the revealed origin and track of air masses causing the episodes. The 25 and 6% of all strong and extreme episodes, respectively, are MX, thus highlighting the co-existence of different aerosol types in the greater Mediterranean. The intensity of both MX and DSS episodes exhibits similar patterns to those of DD strong ones, indicating that desert dust is a determinant factor for the intensity of aerosol episodes in the Mediterranean, including DSS and MX episodes.

Graphical aerosol classification method using aerosol relative optical depth,"A simple graphical method is presented to classify aerosol types based on a combination of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and aerosol relative optical thickness (AROT). Six aerosol types, including maritime (MA), desert dust (DD), continental (CO), sub-continental (SC), urban industry (UI) and biomass burning (BB), are discriminated in a two dimensional space of AOT440 and AROT1020/440. Numerical calculations are performed using MIE theory based on a multi log-normal particle size distribution, and the AROT ranges for each aerosol type are determined. More than 5 years of daily observations from 8 representative aerosol sites are applied to the method to confirm spatial applicability. Finally, 3 individual cases are analyzed according to their specific aerosol status. The outcomes indicate that the new graphical method coordinates well with regional characteristics and is also able to distinguish aerosol variations in individual situations. This technique demonstrates a novel way to estimate different aerosol types and provide information on radiative forcing calculations and satellite data corrections. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",
Simulations of the effect of intensive biomass burning in July 2015 on Arctic radiative budget,"The impact of biomass burning (BB) on aerosol optical properties and radiative budget in the polar region following an intense boreal fire event in North America in July 2015 is explored in this paper. Presented data are obtained from the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) reanalysis and the Fu-Liou radiative transfer model. NAAPS provides particle concentrations and aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 1Â° x 1Â° spatial and 6-hourly temporal resolution, its AOD and vertical profiles were validated with field measurements for this event. Direct aerosol radiative forcings (ARF) at the surface, the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and within the atmosphere are calculated for clear-sky and all-sky conditions, with the surface albedo and cloud properties constrained by satellite retrievals. The mean ARFs at the surface, the TOA, and within the atmosphere averaged for the north pole region (latitudes north of 75.5N) and the study period (July 5â€“15, 2015) are âˆ’13.1 Â± 2.7, 0.3 Â± 2.1, and 13.4 Â± 2.7 W/m2 for clear-sky and âˆ’7.3 Â± 1.8, 5.0 Â± 2.6, and 12.3 Â± 1.6 W/m2 for all-sky conditions respectively. Local ARFs can be a several times larger e.g. the clear-sky surface and TOA ARF reach over Alaska âˆ’85 and âˆ’30 W/m2 and over Svalbard âˆ’41 and âˆ’20 W/m2 respectively. The ARF is found negative at the surface (almost zero over high albedo region though) with the maximum forcing over the BB source region, and weaker forcing under all-sky conditions compared to the clear-sky conditions. Unlike the ARFs at the surface and within the atmosphere, which have consistent forcing signs all over the polar region, the ARF at the TOA changes signs from negative (cooling) over the source region (Alaska) to positive (heating) over bright surfaces (e.g., Greenland) because of strong surface albedo effect. NAAPS simulations also show that the transported BB particle over the Arctic are in the low-to-middle troposphere and above low-level clouds, resulting in little difference in ARFs at the TOA between clear- and all-sky conditions over the regions with high surface albedo. Over dark surfaces, the negative TOA forcing increases with AOD about 50% slower under all-sky conditions compared to clear-sky case. The boreal BB event resulted in large magnitude of ARFs and the high variabilities of the forcings over the polar region has a significant impact on the polar weather conditions and important implications for the polar climate.

"Optical, microphysical and radiative properties of aerosols over a tropical rural site in Kenya, East Africa: Source identification, modification and aerosol type discrimination","A better understanding of aerosol optical, microphysical and radiative properties is a crucial challenge for climate change studies. In the present study, column-integrated aerosol optical and radiative properties observed at a rural site, Mbita (0.42Â°S, 34.20 Â°E, and 1125 m above sea level) located in Kenya, East Africa (EA) are investigated using ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data retrieved during January, 2007 to December, 2015. The annual mean aerosol optical depth (AOD500 nm), Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (AE440â€“870 nm), fine mode fraction of AOD500 nm (FMF500 nm), and columnar water vapor (CWV, cm) were found to be 0.23 Â± 0.08, 1.01 Â± 0.16, 0.60 Â± 0.07, and 2.72 Â± 0.20, respectively. The aerosol optical properties exhibited a unimodal distribution with substantial seasonal heterogeneity in their peak values being low (high) during the local wet (dry) seasons. The observed data showed that Mbita and its environs are significantly influenced by various types of aerosols, with biomass burning and/or urban-industrial (BUI), mixed (MXD), and desert dust (DDT) aerosol types contributing to 37.72%, 32.81%, and 1.40%, respectively during the local dry season (JJA). The aerosol volume size distribution (VSD) exhibited bimodal lognormal structure with a geometric mean radius of 0.15 Î¼m and 3.86â€“5.06 Î¼m for fine- and coarse-mode aerosols, respectively. Further, analysis of single scattering albedo (SSA), asymmetry parameter (ASY) and refractive index (RI) revealed dominance of fine-mode absorbing aerosols during JJA. The averaged aerosol direct radiative forcing (ARF) retrieved from the AERONET showed a strong cooling effect at the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA) and significant warming within the atmosphere (ATM), representing the important role of aerosols played in this rural site of Kenya. Finally, the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model revealed that aerosols from distinct sources resulted in enhanced loading during JJA. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",
Fire frequency drives decadal changes in soil carbon and nitrogen and ecosystem productivity,"Fire frequency is changing globally and is projected to affect the global carbon cycle and climate. However, uncertainty about how ecosystems respond to decadal changes in fire frequency makes it difficult to predict the effects of altered fire regimes on the carbon cycle; for instance, we do not fully understand the long-term effects of fire on soil carbon and nutrient storage, or whether fire-driven nutrient losses limit plant productivity. Here we analyse data from 48 sites in savanna grasslands, broadleaf forests and needleleaf forests spanning up to 65 years, during which time the frequency of fires was altered at each site. We find that frequently burned plots experienced a decline in surface soil carbon and nitrogen that was non-saturating through time, having 36 per cent (Â±13 per cent) less carbon and 38 per cent (Â±16 per cent) less nitrogen after 64 years than plots that were protected from fire. Fire-driven carbon and nitrogen losses were substantial in savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests, but not in temperate and boreal needleleaf forests. We also observe comparable soil carbon and nitrogen losses in an independent field dataset and in dynamic model simulations of global vegetation. The model study predicts that the long-term losses of soil nitrogen that result from more frequent burning may in turn decrease the carbon that is sequestered by net primary productivity by about 20 per cent of the total carbon that is emitted from burning biomass over the same period. Furthermore, we estimate that the effects of changes in fire frequency on ecosystem carbon storage may be 30 per cent too low if they do not include multidecadal changes in soil carbon, especially in drier savanna grasslands. Future changes in fire frequency may shift ecosystem carbon storage by changing soil carbon pools and nitrogen limitations on plant growth, altering the carbon sink capacity of frequently burning savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests.

Size-resolved aerosol and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) properties in the remote marine South China Sea-Part 1: Observations and source classification,"Ship-based measurements of aerosol and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) properties are presented for 2 weeks of observations in remote marine regions of the South China Sea/East Sea during the southwestern monsoon (SWM) season. Smoke from extensive biomass burning throughout the Maritime Continent advected into this region during the SWM, where it was mixed with anthropogenic continental pollution and emissions from heavy shipping activities. Eight aerosol types were identified using a k-means cluster analysis with data from a size-resolved CCN characterization system. Interpretation of the clusters was supplemented by additional onboard aerosol and meteorological measurements, satellite, and model products for the region. A typical bimodal marine boundary layer background aerosol population was identified and observed mixing with accumulation mode aerosol from other sources, primarily smoke from fires in Borneo and Sumatra. Hygroscopicity was assessed using the Îº parameter and was found to average 0.40 for samples dominated by aged accumulation mode smoke; 0.65 for accumulation mode marine aerosol; 0.60 in an anthropogenic aerosol plume; and 0.22 during a short period that was characterized by elevated levels of volatile organic compounds not associated with biomass burning impacts. As a special subset of the background marine aerosol, clean air masses substantially scrubbed of particles were observed following heavy precipitation or the passage of squall lines, with changes in observed aerosol properties occurring on the order of minutes. Average CN number concentrations, size distributions, and Îº values are reported for each population type, along with CCN number concentrations for particles that activated at supersaturations between 0.14 and 0.85%.

Method to establish the emission inventory of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds in China and its application in the period 2008-2012,"A method was developed to establish a comprehensive anthropogenic VOC emission inventory in China, in which a four-level source categorization was proposed, and an emission factor determination system together with a reference database were developed. And this was applied to establish VOC emission inventories for the period 2008-2012. Results show China's anthropogenic VOC emissions increased from 22.45 Tg in 2008 to 29.85 Tg in 2012 at an annual average rate of 7.38%, with Shandong, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Hebei provinces being the largest emitters. Industrial processes, transportation and solvent utilization were the key sources, accounting for 39.3%, 25.6%, and 14.9% of the total emissions in 2012, respectively. Passenger cars, biofuel combustion, coke production, field burning of biomass, and raw chemical manufacturing were the primary VOC sources nationwide. The key sources for each province were different because of the disparate industry and energy structure. China's VOC emissions displayed remarkable spatial variation, with emissions in the east and southeast regions being much larger than in the northwest, and the high emission areas mainly centered in the Bohai Economic Rim, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the Sichuan Basin. The size of high emission areas expanded over the period 2008-2012, with heavily polluted city clusters gradually emerging. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",
Source apportionment coupled with gas/particle partitioning theory and risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons associated with size-segregated airborne particulate matter,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured in airborne particulate matter (PM) collected by an eight-stage (S0, S1, ..., S7, and SF) particle sizing sampler in three sampling periods, 85 h (85-h) each period. The measured particle-phase PAHs (P-only) data set and the sum of predicted gas-phase and measured particle phase PAHs (predicted G + P) data set considering the effect of gas/particle partitioning were used in positive matrix factorization (PMF) for source apportionment. Benzo[a]pyrene equivalent concentration (BaPeq) and incremental life cancer risk (ILCR) model were utilized for risk assessment of PAHs. The average concentrations of 85-h PM10 and PM2.1 were 292.729 and 142.642 Î¼g/m3, respectively. The average concentration of 15 PAHs was 480.777 ng/m3 in PM10 and 254.464 ng/m3 in PM2.1. PAHs showed unimodal distribution among the nine sampling stages and S5 collected the most concentrations of PAHs and PM. PAHs with over four aromatic rings tended to accumulate in fine PM especially in S5 and S6 while PAHs with less than four rings preferred to stay in coarse PM especially in S0. A four source profiles for P-only were identified by PMF as follows with their source contributions: biomass burning (BB) (9.580 %), coal combustion (CC) (10.600 %), ""air-surface exchange"" (20.160 %), and vehicle emission (VE) (59.660 %). However, three source profiles for predicted G + P only identified including BB (93.330 %), CC (0.0600 %), and VE (6.610 %). The average 85-h average total BaPeq of 15 PAHs was 5.226 g/m3. S4, S5, and S6 had BaPeq concentrations greater than domestic standard concentration and ILCR value higher than 10-6. Â© 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",
Carbon isotope-constrained seasonality of carbonaceous aerosol sources from an urban location (Kanpur) in the Indo-Gangetic Plain,"The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in northern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh is a major source of carbonaceous aerosols in South Asia. However, poorly constrained seasonality of their sources over the IGP leads to large uncertainty in climate and health effects. Here we present a first data set for year-round radiocarbon (Î´14C) and stable carbon (Ïƒ13C)-based source apportionment of total carbon (TC) in ambient PM10 (n = 17) collected from an urban site (Kanpur: 26.5Â°N, 80.3Â°E) in the IGP during January 2007 to January 2008. The year-round 14C-based fraction biomass (fbio-TC) estimate at Kanpur averages ~77 Â± 7% and emphasizes an impact of biomass burning emissions (BBEs). The highest fbio-TC (%) is observed in fall season (October-November, 85 Â± 6%) followed by winter (December-February, 80 Â± 4%) and spring (March-May, 75 Â± 8%), while lowest values are found in summer (June-September, 69 Â± 2%). Since biomass/coal combustion and vehicular emissions mostly contribute to carbonaceous aerosols over the IGP, we predict Ïƒ13CTC (Ïƒ13Cpred) over Kanpur using known Ïƒ13C source signatures and the measured Î´14C value of each sample. The seasonal variability of Ïƒ13Cobs - Ïƒ13Cpred versus Î´14CTC together with air mass back trajectories and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer fire count data reveal that carbonaceous aerosols in winter/fall are significantly influenced by atmospheric aging (downwind transport of crop residue burning/wood combustion emissions in the northern IGP), while local sources (wheat residue combustion/vehicular emissions) dominate in spring/summer. Given the large temporal and seasonal variability in sources and emission strength of TC over the IGP, 14C-based constraints are, thus, crucial for reducing their uncertainties in carbonaceous aerosol budgets in climate models.

Sources of ultrafine particles in the Eastern United States,"Source contributions to ultrafine particle number concentrations for a summertime period in the Eastern U.S. are investigated using the chemical transport model PMCAMx-UF. New source-resolved number emissions inventories are developed for biomass burning, dust, gasoline automobiles, industrial sources, non-road and on-road diesel. According to the inventory for this summertime period in the Eastern U.S., gasoline automobiles are responsible for 40% of the ultrafine particle number emissions, followed by industrial sources (33%), non-road diesel (16%), on-road diesel (10%), and 1% from biomass burning and dust. With these emissions as input, the chemical transport model PMCAMx-UF reproduces observed ultrafine particle number concentrations (N3-100) in Pittsburgh with an error of 12%. For this summertime period in the Eastern U.S., nucleation is predicted to be the source of more than 90% of the total particle number concentrations. The source contributions to primary particle number concentrations are on average similar to those of their source emissions contributions: gasoline is predicted to contribute 36% of the total particle number concentrations, followed by industrial sources (31%), non-road diesel (18%), on-road diesel (10%), biomass burning (1%), and long-range transport (4%). For this summertime period in Pittsburgh, number source apportionment predictions for particles larger than 3nm in diameter (traffic 65%, other combustion sources 35%) are consistent with measurement-based source apportionment (traffic 60%, combustion sources 40%).

"Columnar-integrated aerosol optical properties and classification of different aerosol types over the semi-arid region, Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh","This study presents a characterization of aerosol columnar properties measured at a semi-arid station Anantapur in the southern part of India during the period from October 2012 to September 2013. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (Î±) have been retrieved from Microtops II Sunphotometer over the observation site. The results show that a pronounced spectral and monthly variability in the optical properties of aerosols is mainly due to anthropogenic sources. The results show that the spectral curvature can effectively be used as a tool for aerosol type discrimination, since the fine-mode aerosols exhibit negative curvature, while the coarse-mode particles are positive. The classification of aerosols is also proposed by using the values of AOD at 500nm and Angstrom exponent values (Î±(380-870)) by applying threshold values obtained from the frequency distribution of AOD. The results of the analysis were identified by four individual components (anthropogenic/biomass burning, coarse/dust, coarse/marine, clean continental) of different origin and compositions. The most frequent situations observed over the site are that due to the anthropogenic/biomass burning situations which account for about 45.37%, followed by coarse/dust (43.64%), clean continental (7.2%) and coarse/marine (3.82%) during summer. The identification of the aerosol source type and the modification processes are analyzed by using the Gobbi et al. (2007) classification scheme based on the measured scattering properties (Î±, dÎ±) derived from the Microtops II Sunphotometer. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.",
Radiocarbon-based source apportionment of elemental carbon aerosols at two South Asian receptor observatories over a full annual cycle,"Black carbon (BC) aerosols impact climate and air quality. Since BC from fossil versus biomass combustion have different optical properties and different abilities to penetrate the lungs, it is important to better understand their relative contributions in strongly affected regions such as South Asia. This study reports the first year-round 14C-based source apportionment of elemental carbon (EC), the mass-based correspondent to BC, using as regional receptor sites the international Maldives Climate Observatory in Hanimaadhoo (MCOH) and the mountaintop observatory of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Sinhagad, India (SINH). For the highly-polluted winter season (December-March), the fractional contribution to EC from biomass burning (fbio) was 53 Â±5% (n = 6) at MCOH and 56 Â±3% at SINH (n = 5). The fbio for the non-winter remainder was 53 Â±11% (n = 6) at MCOH and 48 Â±8% (n = 7) at SINH. This observation-based constraint on near-equal contributions from biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion at both sites compare with predictions from eight technology-based emission inventory (EI) models for India of (fbio)EI spanning 55-88%, suggesting that most current EI for Indian BC systematically under predict the relative contribution of fossil fuel combustion. A continued iterative testing of bottom-up EI with top-down observational source constraints has the potential to lead to reduced uncertainties regarding EC sources and emissions to the benefit of both models of climate and air quality as well as guide efficient policies to mitigate emissions.

Observations and analysis of organic aerosol evolution in some prescribed fire smoke plumes,"Open biomass burning is a significant source of primary air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) and non-methane organic gases (NMOG). However, the physical and chemical atmospheric processing of these emissions during transport is poorly understood. Atmospheric transformations of biomass burning emissions have been investigated in environmental chambers, but there have been limited opportunities to investigate these transformations in the atmosphere. In this study, we deployed a suite of real-time instrumentation on a Twin Otter aircraft to sample smoke from prescribed fires in South Carolina, conducting measurements at both the source and downwind to characterize smoke evolution with atmospheric aging. Organic aerosol (OA) within the smoke plumes was quantified using an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS); refractory black carbon (rBC) was quantified using a single-particle soot photometer, and carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were measured using a cavity ring-down spectrometer. During the two fires for which we were able to obtain aerosol aging data, normalized excess mixing ratios and ""export factors"" of conserved species (rBC, CO, CO2) suggested that changes in emissions at the source did not account for most of the differences observed in samples of increasing age. An investigation of AMS mass fragments indicated that the in-plume fractional contribution (fm/z) to OA of the primary fragment (m/z 60) decreased downwind, while the fractional contribution of the secondary fragment (m/z 44) increased. Increases in f44 are typically interpreted as indicating chemical aging of OA. Likewise, we observed an increase in the O : C elemental ratio downwind, which is usually associated with aerosol aging. However, the rapid mixing of these plumes into the background air suggests that these chemical transformations may be attributable to the different volatilities of the compounds that fragment to these m/z in the AMS. The gas-particle partitioning behavior of the bulk OA observed during the study was consistent with the predictions from a parameterization developed for open biomass burning emissions in the laboratory. Furthermore, we observed no statistically significant increase in total organic mass with atmospheric transport. Hence, our results suggest that dilution-driven evaporation likely dominated over the chemical production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) within our smoke plumes, presumably due to the fast dilution and limited aging times (< âˆ¼ 5 h) that we could sample.

Air quality pattern assessment in Malaysia using multivariate techniques; [Penilaian corak kualiti udara di Malaysia menggunakan teknik multivariat],"This study aims to investigate the spatial characteristics in the pattern of air quality monitoring sites, identify the most discriminating parameters contributing to air pollution, and predict the level of air pollution index (API) in Malaysia using multivariate techniques. Five parameters observed for five years (2000-2004) were used. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis classified the five air quality monitoring sites into two independent groups based on the characteristics of activities in the monitoring stations. Discriminate analysis for standard, backward stepwise and forward stepwise mode gave a correct assignation of more than 87% in the confusion matrix. This result indicates that only three parameters (PM10, SO2 and NO2) with a p<0.0001 discriminate best in polluting the air. The major possible sources of air pollution were identified using principal component analysis that account for more than 58% and 60% in the total variance. Based on the findings, anthropogenic activities (vehicular emission, industrial activities, construction sites, bush burning) have a strong influence in the source of air pollution. Furthermore, artificial neural network (ANN) was used to predict the level of air pollution index at R2 = 0.8493 and RMSE = 5.9184. This indicates that ANN can predict more than 84% of the API.

Development of PM2.5 source impact spatial fields using a hybrid source apportionment air quality model,"An integral part of air quality management is knowledge of the impact of pollutant sources on ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM). There is also a growing desire to directly use source impact estimates in health studies; however, source impacts cannot be directly measured. Several limitations are inherent in most source apportionment methods motivating the development of a novel hybrid approach that is used to estimate source impacts by combining the capabilities of receptor models (RMs) and chemical transport models (CTMs). The hybrid CTM-RM method calculates adjustment factors to refine the CTM-estimated impact of sources at monitoring sites using pollutant species observations and the results of CTM sensitivity analyses, though it does not directly generate spatial source impact fields. The CTM used here is the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, and the RM approach is based on the chemical mass balance (CMB) model. This work presents a method that utilizes kriging to spatially interpolate source-specific impact adjustment factors to generate revised CTM source impact fields from the CTM-RM method results, and is applied for January 2004 over the continental United States. The kriging step is evaluated using data withholding and by comparing results to data from alternative networks. Data withholding also provides an estimate of method uncertainty. Directly applied (hybrid, HYB) and spatially interpolated (spatial hybrid, SH) hybrid adjustment factors at withheld observation sites had a correlation coefficient of 0.89, a linear regression slope of 0.83 Â± 0.02, and an intercept of 0.14 Â± 0.02. Refined source contributions reflect current knowledge of PM emissions (e.g., significant differences in biomass burning impact fields). Concentrations of 19 species and total PM2.5 mass were reconstructed for withheld observation sites using HYB and SH adjustment factors. The mean concentrations of total PM2.5 at withheld observation sites were 11.7 (Â± 8.3), 16.3 (Â± 11), 8.59 (Â± 4.7), and 9.2 (Â± 5.7) Î¼gm-3 for the observations, CTM, HYB, and SH predictions, respectively. Correlations improved for concentrations of major ions, including nitrate (CMAQ-DDM (decoupled direct method): 0.404, SH: 0.449), ammonium (CMAQ-DDM: 0.454, SH: 0.492), and sulfate (CMAQ-DDM: 0.706, SH: 0.730). Errors in simulated concentrations of metals were reduced considerably: 295 % (CMAQ-DDM) to 139 % (SH) for vanadium; and 1340 % (CMAQ-DDM) to 326 % (SH) for manganese. Errors in simulated concentrations of some metals are expected to remain given the uncertainties in source profiles. Species concentrations were reconstructed using SH results, and the error relative to observed concentrations was greatly reduced as compared to CTM-simulated concentrations. Results demonstrate that the hybrid method along with a spatial extension can be used for large-scale, spatially resolved source apportionment studies where observational data are spatially and temporally limited.

The influence of mixed layer depth along the course of incoming air masses to the transport of PM10 components at three rural sampling sites in Spain,"The main objective of this research, was to incorporate Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) estimations across backward air mass trajectories to the broadly used Trajectory Sector Analysis (TSA) and Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) methods, in order to attain a three-dimensional (3D) identification of aerosol transport pathways and to reveal the role of the Mixed Layer (ML) on the transferring of particulates. The developed 3D-TSA and 3D-CWT tools, were combined with daily concentrations of PM10-bound SO42âˆ’, NO3âˆ’, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and K+ measured at three rural sampling sites in Spain during the years 2019â€“2020. Vertically extended Saharan dust intrusions from North Africa were associated with air masses travelling both inside and outside the ML and were related to increases of PM10-bound SO42âˆ’ and Ca2+ at all stations, attributed to the reactions of mineral dust with gaseous precursors of SO42âˆ’ such as SO2. The advection of sea salt particles, marked by high levels of Na+ and Mg2+, was associated with marine air masses from the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean, moving mainly within the ML. Enhanced levels of PM10 constituents emitted by anthropogenic sources, such as NO3âˆ’ (traffic and industrial emissions) and K+ (biomass burning), were clearly related to air masses originating from Iberian Peninsula, Central Europe and North African coastline, whilst in most cases the strongest contributions were transferred by air masses moving above the ML. Therefore, the implemented 3D version of TSA and CWT methods, revealed new information regarding the altitudinal characteristics of air masses affecting PM10 levels in Spain. Â© 2025 Elsevier B.V.",
Climate-vegetation intersection in determining the burn rate in an area of the Brazilian Cerrado,"This study aimed to develop a predictive model, using climatic data and vegetation indices collected via satellite from 2001 to 2021, to estimate the daily burn rate in a protected area of the Brazilian Cerrado. For this purpose, data from the MODIS sensor was used, covering variables such as temperature, evapotranspiration, active fire, and burned area, complemented by climatic information from CHIRPS and Terraclimate products. The determination of the burn rate involved the polygonization of burned areas and the accounting of the duration of fires. In this context, machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, and SVM were explored, implemented through the Scikit-learn library. The focus of the study was to evaluate which of these algorithms would show the most suitable performance in predictions. The results point to an annual average of 50,000 hectares affected by wildfires in the protected area and its vicinity, with notable variations over the years analyzed. A correlation was identified between the daily burn rate and variables such as wind speed and temperature, while NDVI and evapotranspiration showed an inversely proportional relationship. The results suggest that, among the tested models, Random Forest may have a relatively more efficient performance, standing out in the accuracy of predictions. However, it is emphasized that caution and additional studies are necessary to confirm these results. In summary, our foundings indicates the potential of machine learning techniques in environmental management of wildfires, potentially contributing to the protection of the Cerrado ecosystems, although further investigations are necessary for a more comprehensive understanding.

Organic tracers from biomass burning in snow from the coast to the ice sheet summit of East Antarctica,"Biomass burning is a significant process in the Earth system, driving ecosystem dynamics and changes in global vegetation, and affecting the carbon cycle and climate. Projections of future fire activities require an understanding of the connection between fire history and climate in the past. Polar snow/ice contain long-term records of past climates and fire activity and hold great promise to improve our understanding of wildfire patterns. Here, using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry techniques, we quantified three organic compounds (levoglucosan, vanillic, and syringic acids) released by biomass burning in snow samples collected along a 1250-km transect from the coast to the ice sheet summit Dome A in East Antarctica. Results indicate that these tracers are ubiquitous and have reached the ice sheet summit from the continental emissions in the Southern Hemisphere. These compounds showed high levels close to the coastal areas and decreased to a low level on the Antarctic plateau. The snow samples had similar levoglucosan/vanillic acid (âˆ¼45) and levoglucosan/syringic acid ratios (âˆ¼243) as aerosols from biomass burning. Multivariate analysis indicates that these compounds were likely derived from the burning of grasses and evergreen broadleaf trees that are widespread in Southern Hemisphere than from evergreen conifers that dominate northern hemisphere fire-prone ecosystems. Snow accumulation rate influenced the levels of these compounds, while coexisting ions had little effect on compound contents in the snow. The low concentrations of levoglucosan at inland sites (mean of 2.7 pg mLâˆ’1; versus 3.5 and 3.7 pg mLâˆ’1 in coastal and transition zones, respectively) could be associated with the oxidation by OH radicals under sunlight. Our analysis demonstrated that the ubiquity of multiple biomarkers from biomass burning in East Antarctic surface snow can provide baseline concentrations for future studies in Antarctica.

Insights from an Integrated LC-MS/MS and Machine Learning Analysis into the Role of Long-Chain CHO-Containing Compounds in Ambient Light-Absorbing Aerosols,"Fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning, and cooking are major emission sources of urban organic aerosols, which have a significant impact on human health and global radiative forcing. This study collected ambient PM2.5 in Shanghai, China, along with particulate matter from biodiesel/diesel-fueled vehicles, bio-oil pyrolysis, and laboratory-scale experiments conducted using a Miniature Combustion Aerosol Standard (lab-MINICAST) experiments. Targeted MS/MS using HPLC-Q-TOF-MS methodology and machine learning were applied to investigate and decode the light-absorbing chromophores of methanol-extracted organic aerosols. The results showed emissions from biomass burning and vehicles are the main contributors to ambient organic aerosols. CHO compounds accounted for the largest proportion. A fraction of the identified light-absorbing chromophores were long-chain CHO-containing compounds, including fatty acids (C18H34O2, C18H32O2, C16H30O2, C5H8O2, and a subset of CnH2nO2 (12 < n < 25)) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs, the remaining CnH2nO2 (12 < n < 25)) originatimg from vehicle emissions, accounting for 65.256% of the organic aerosol light-absorbing during nonbiomass burning days, but only accounting for 7.12% of the CHO compounds and 3.06% of the organic aerosols. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models revealed that all the light-absorbing molecules of the methanol-extracted samples identified in this study typically exhibit higher weights of atomic around oxygen-containing functional groups (>0.5), contrasting with non-light-absorbing substances, which display more uniformly distributed lower atomic weights. This may provide some explanation for the light-absorbing ability of fatty acids and FAMEs. Â© 2024 American Chemical Society.",
Unveiling the source contributions of fine and coarse particulate matter using PM-bound metals and PMF-AI modeling,"Particle pollution is a critical global concern with significant implications for public health and the environment. Both fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) particles exhibit diverse compositions and origins, leading to distinct health and environmental consequences. In this study, K-means clustering was employed to differentiate between local, regional, and long-range transport (LRT) sources, showing that LRT significantly increases PM2.5-10 levels, leading to a more than 1.26-fold rise in its annual mean concentration. Using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model, we identified five local and regional source of PM2.5 and four in case of PM2.5-10. Further, AutoML model explains up to 70 % and 71 % of the daily variance in PM2.5 and PM2.5-10, respectively. The complex relationship of these sources was explained using SHapley Additive ExPlanations (SHAP). Among the five major factors identified, SHAP analysis reveals that oil combustion (24 %), coal burning (18 %), and non-ferrous metal smelting/biomass burning (17 %) are the predominant contributors to PM2.5. In contrast, ocean spray (28 %) is identified as a significant source of PM2.5-10 pollution followed by oil, non-ferrous metal smelting/biomass burning (20 %) and traffic related emission (14 %). This study offers a novel and comprehensive methodology for identifying the distinct sources of fine and coarse particulate matter. It provides valuable insights that can inform future policies and regulations, particularly in regions facing challenges related to PM pollution.

"An integrated approach for determining the spatial distribution, source apportionment and human health risks of PAHs in soils of rapidly-urbanized areas","The rise of large urban agglomerations has exacerbated pollutant emissions, resulting in regional soil contamination with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which jeopardizes the development of urban agglomerations and affects human health. There is a lack of research in this area in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, with the existing studies on PAHs in soil in the larger region often neglecting the spatial heterogeneity of the pollution sources and systematic analysis of risk assessment. This study introduces the Distribution-Source-Risk framework, analyzed soil PAH pollutants in the region, and examined PAH sources, distribution patterns, and associated health risks. Random forest modeling was employed to map PAH distribution in the BTH soils. City classification analysis was conducted based on the derived pollution levels and urbanization degree, resulting in four city types: high urbanization and high pollution, high urbanization and low pollution, low urbanization and high pollution, and low urbanization and low pollution. Primary PAH sources include coal-burning (29%), coking (25%), traffic (25%), and biomass-burning (21%), with varying contributions based on city types. The overall order of human health risks was coal-burning â€‹> â€‹traffic â€‹> â€‹coking â€‹> â€‹biomass-burning sources. Finally, differen policies for soil PAH PAH management (such as energy transition and green infrastructure) were elaborated to promote coordinated development of regional urbanization environment. In summary, this research offers a comprehensive approach, linking processes to provide a precise understanding of pollution across different entities (cities, sources, and populations). Our findings reveal distinct pollution patterns across city types and highlight targeted mitigation priorities and provide a systematic, data-driven framework for regional soil PAH management and public health protection.

An AI-Based Framework for Characterizing the Atmospheric Fate of Air Pollutants Within Diverse Environmental Settings,"This study introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI) modeling framework that combines machine learning algorithms optimized through metaheuristics with explainable AI to capture complex interactions among pollutant concentrations, meteorological data, and socio-economic indicators. Applied to a COVID-19-related dataset comprising 404 variables, with benzene concentrations as the targetâ€”measured using proton transfer reactionâ€“mass spectrometry in Belgrade, Serbiaâ€”the framework demonstrated exceptional sensitivity in assessing the impact of complex environmental and societal changes during the pandemic. Explainable AI techniques, such as SHAP and SAGE, were employed to reveal the influence of each predictor, while the clustering of SHAP values identified distinct environmental settings that influenced benzene behavior. Three distinct settings were identified regarding benzene levels during the onset of the state of emergency. The first, involving local petroleum-related activities, biomass burning, chemical manufacturing, and traffic, led to a 15.7% reduction in benzene levels. The second, characterized by non-combustion processes, nocturnal chemistry, and the specific meteorological context, resulted in a 51.9% increase. The third, driven by local industrial processes, contributed to a modest 2.33% reduction. The study underscored the critical role of environmental settings in shaping air pollutant behavior, emphasizing the importance of integrating broader environmental contexts into models to gain a more comprehensive understanding of air pollutants and their dynamics.

Predicting opinion using deep learning: From burning to sustainable management of organic waste in Indian State of Punjab,"In winter season, the burning of crop residues for ease of sowing the next crop, along with industrial emissions and vehicular pollution leads to settling of a thick layer of smog in northern part of India. Therefore, to understand the opinion of farmers regarding sustainable management of organic waste, the present study was conducted in Ludhiana district of Indian state of Punjab. An ex post facto research design was used and a total of 800 dairy farmers having significant crop area were selected randomly for the study, grouped equally as small and large dairy farmers. Results revealed that majority of farmers had a highly favourable opinion regarding organic waste management due to the fact that they were aware of the ill-effects of undesirable practices like crop residue burning. Further, to predict the farmersâ€™ opinion and the effect of independent variables on farmersâ€™ opinion, a multi-layer perceptron feed-forward deep neural network was developed with mean squared error of 0.036 and 0.137 for validation and training data sets respectively, marking a novel approach of analysing farmersâ€™ behaviour. The neural network highlighted that with increase in the magnitude of input variables, namely, education, experience in dairying, information source utilisation, knowledge regarding organic waste management, etc., the farmersâ€™ opinion regarding sustainable waste management increases. The study concluded with the impression that cognitive processes like education, information and knowledge play a significant role in forming the opinion of the farmers. Therefore, efforts focusing on enhancing cognition should be made for sustainable management of organic waste. Â© The Author(s) 2023.",
NEIVAv1.0: Next-generation Emissions InVentory expansion of Akagi et al. (2011) version 1.0,"Accurate representation of fire emissions is critical for modeling the in-plume, near-source, and remote effects of biomass burning (BB) on atmospheric composition, air quality, and climate. In recent years application of advanced instrumentation has significantly improved knowledge of the compounds emitted from fires, which, coupled with a large number of recent laboratory and field campaigns, has facilitated the emergence of new emission factor (EF) compilations. The Next-generation Emissions InVentory expansion of Akagi (NEIVA) version 1.0 is one such compilation in which the EFs for 14 globally relevant fuel and fire types have been updated to include data from recent studies, with a focus on gaseous non-methane organic compounds (NMOC_g). The data are stored in a series of connected tables that facilitate flexible querying from the individual study level to recommended averages of all laboratory and field data by fire type. The querying features are enabled by assignment of unique identifiers to all compounds and constituents, including thousands of NMOC_g. NEIVA also includes chemical and physical property data and model surrogate assignments for three widely used chemical mechanisms for each NMOC_g. NEIVA EF datasets are compared with recent publications and other EF compilations at the individual compound level and in the context of overall volatility distributions and hydroxyl (OH) reactivity (OHR) estimates. The NMOC_g in NEIVA include âˆ¼ 4â€“8 times more compounds with improved representation of intermediate volatility organic compounds, resulting in much lower overall volatility (lowest-volatility bin shifted by as much as 3 orders of magnitude) and significantly higher OHR (up to 90 %) than other compilations. These updates can strongly impact model predictions of the effects of BB on atmospheric composition and chemistry. Â© Author(s) 2024.",
"Ambient Measurements of Daytime Decay Rates of Levoglucosan, Mannosan, and Galactosan","Quantifying atmospheric degradation of levoglucosan, a highly specific molecular marker for biomass burning (BB) aerosols, is essential in assessing impacts of BB on air quality and climate. However, the stability of levoglucosan in the atmosphere has only been evaluated through laboratory experiments or model simulations. Here, we investigated the atmospheric stability of levoglucosan and its two co-emitting isomers, mannosan and galactosan, utilizing bihourly measurement data at a suburban site in Hong Kong over a period of 4Â months. The concentrations of the three saccharides, upon normalization by BB-derived potassium, displayedÂ a distinct and consistent depletion during daytime hours from 08:00 to 16:00, which follows an exponential decay pattern. We calculated individual daytime decay rate constants of the three saccharides by utilizing their day-by-day decay kinetics. The decay rates of mannosan and galactosan were 34% and 40% higher than that of levoglucosan. The estimated lifetime of levoglucosan was 13Â Â±Â 7Â hr, ranging from 3 to 46Â hr underÂ the atmospheric condition of temperature of 22Â Â±Â 5Â°C, and a relative humidity of 55Â Â±Â 14%. This workÂ providesÂ the first kinetic data of levoglucosan degradation derived from real ambient measurements. TheyÂ are valuable for refining model predictions concerning BB aerosol impacts on local, regional, and global scales. Â© 2025. The Author(s).",
Aerosol classification by application of machine learning spectral clustering algorithm,"Precise understanding of aerosol classification is crucial for accurately quantifying the effects of aerosols on the Earth's energy budget, improving remote sensing retrieval algorithms, formulating climate change-related policies, and more. In this study, we used aerosol measurements from the quality assured AERosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) and utilized a multivariate spectral clustering algorithm, a machine learning tool, to classify global aerosols. The spectral clustering algorithm is a variant of the clustering algorithm that employs eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data matrix to project the data into a lower-dimensional space of a similar cluster. To accomplish this, we considered five aerosol optical parameters: fine-mode Aerosol Optical Depth, Extinction Angstrom Exponent, Absorption Angstrom Exponent, Single Scattering Albedo, and Refractive Index from 150 AERONET sites distributed in six continents (Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America) during 1993 to 2022. Using the clustering analysis, we identified four primary aerosol types: dust, urban, biomass burning, and mixed aerosols. Among the continents, the African and Asian sites exhibited the highest contribution of dust aerosols, as the region has significant global dust sources. Conversely, Australia, Europe, North, and South America are predominantly influenced by fine-mode aerosols, given their considerable distance from major dust source regions.

Global aerosol-type classification using a new hybrid algorithm and Aerosol Robotic Network data,"The properties of aerosols are highly uncertain owing to the complex changes in their composition in different regions. The radiative properties of different aerosol types differ considerably and are vital for studying aerosol regional and/or global climate effects. Traditional aerosol-type identification algorithms, generally based on cluster or empirical analysis methods, are often inaccurate and time-consuming. In response, our study aimed to develop a new aerosol-type classification model using an innovative hybrid algorithm to improve the precision and efficiency of aerosol-type identification. This novel algorithm incorporates an optical database, constructed using the Mie scattering model, and employs a random forest algorithm to classify different aerosol types based on the optical data from the database. The complex refractive index was used as a baseline to assess the performance of our hybrid algorithm against the traditional Gaussian kernel density clustering method for aerosol-type identification. The hybrid algorithm demonstrated impressive consistency rates of 90 %, 85 %, 84 %, 84 %, and 100 % for dust, mixed-coarse (mixed, course-mode aerosol), mixed-fine (mixed, fine-mode aerosol), urban/industrial, and biomass burning aerosols, respectively. Moreover, it achieved remarkable precision, with evaluation metric indexes for micro-precision, micro-recall, micro-F1-score, and accuracy of 95 %, 89 %, 91 %, and 89 %, respectively. Lastly, a global map of aerosol types was generated using the new hybrid algorithm to characterize aerosol types across the five continents. This study, utilizing a novel approach for the classification of aerosol, will help improve the accuracy of aerosol inversion and determine the sources of aerosol pollution. Â© Author(s) 2024.",
AEROSOL CLASSIFICATION IN CYPRUS USING ACTIVE AND PASSIVE REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES,"Limassol region in Cyprus, located in the Eastern Mediterranean, represents a major crossroads for various air masses, making the place a hub for mixing particles from both local and remote aerosol sources. The unique atmospheric conditions of the area offer an ideal place to study the vertical atmospheric structure. This study utilizes active and passive remote sensing techniques, such as the sun-photometer AERONET CUT-TEPAK station (Aerosol Robotic Network) and the Polly XT Raman LIDAR depolarization system available in Limassol (34.7Â°N, 33Â°E). An extended analysis of long-term ground-based measurements using AERONET Level 2.0 solar products is presented. The study focuses on the classification method proposed by Toledano et al. (2007) [1] for different aerosol types. Aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD) and Ã…ngstrÃ¶m Exponent at 440-870 nm (AE) are examined for 14 years (2010 - 2023). The results show a strong contribution of dust particles in spring months and continental particles in summer periods. Marine particles were found to be extremely dominant according to the classification. Subsequently, to examine the presence of dust particles in the marine's classification, the study incorporates the particle depolarization ratio (PDR) from the LIDAR vertical profiles at 532 nm using the Klett method. Thus, a new aerosol scheme has been developed concluding in four aerosol categories (dominating conditions of marine aerosol (M), mineral dust (D), anthropogenic haze/ biomass burning (H+S), mixed aerosol).

Modeling Novel Aqueous Particle and Cloud Chemistry Processes of Biomass Burning Phenols and Their Potential to Form Secondary Organic Aerosols,"Phenols emitted from biomass burning contribute significantly to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation through the partitioning of semivolatile products formed from gas-phase chemistry and multiphase chemistry in aerosol liquid water and clouds. The aqueous-phase SOA (aqSOA) formed via hydroxyl radical (â€¢OH), singlet molecular oxygen (1O2*), and triplet excited states of organic compounds (3C*), which oxidize dissolved phenols in the aqueous phase, might play a significant role in the evolution of organic aerosol (OA). However, a quantitative and predictive understanding of aqSOA has been challenging. Here, we develop a stand-alone box model to investigate the formation of SOA from gas-phase â€¢OH chemistry and aqSOA formed by the dissolution of phenols followed by their aqueous-phase reactions with â€¢OH, 1O2*, and 3C* in cloud droplets and aerosol liquid water. We investigate four phenolic compounds, i.e., phenol, guaiacol, syringol, and guaiacyl acetone (GA), which represent some of the key potential sources of aqSOA from biomass burning in clouds. For the same initial precursor organic gas that dissolves in aerosol/cloud liquid water and subsequently reacts with aqueous phase oxidants, we predict that the aqSOA formation potential (defined as aqSOA formed per unit dissolved organic gas concentration) of these phenols is higher than that of isoprene-epoxydiol (IEPOX), a well-known aqSOA precursor. Cloud droplets can dissolve a broader range of soluble phenols compared to aqueous aerosols, since the liquid water contents of aerosols are orders of magnitude smaller than cloud droplets. Our simulations suggest that highly soluble and reactive multifunctional phenols like GA would predominantly undergo cloud chemistry within cloud layers, while gas-phase chemistry is likely to be more important for less soluble phenols. But in the absence of clouds, the condensation of low-volatility products from gas-phase oxidation followed by their reversible partitioning to organic aerosols dominates SOA formation, while the SOA formed through aqueous aerosol chemistry increases with relative humidity (RH), approaching 40% of the sum of gas and aqueous aerosol chemistry at 95% RH for GA. Our model developments of biomass-burning phenols and their aqueous chemistry can be readily implemented in regional and global atmospheric chemistry models to investigate the aqueous aerosol and cloud chemistry of biomass-burning organic gases in the atmosphere.

The newest emission inventory of anthropogenic full-volatility organic in Central China,"Organic aerosol (OA) is the largest and most complicated component of aerosols that has significant impacts on human health and global climate. However, current models cannot accurately predict the concentrations and sources of primary and secondary OA due to the oversimplification of traditional organic emission inventories. Traditional emission inventories do not consider important precursors of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), such as semi-volatile and intermediate-volatility organic compounds (SVOCs and IVOCs). To improve the accuracy of OA prediction and source identification, it is essential to refine precursor emissions. In this study, a full-volatility organic compounds emission inventory was established for the Central China, with Henan Province as a representative in 2020. The anthropogenic emissions of ultralow volatility organic compounds (xLVOCs), SVOCs, IVOCs, and VOCs were 53.9 kt, 55.3 kt, 182.1 kt, and 586.3 kt, respectively, effectively filling the gap of 181.3 kt in traditional organic compound emission inventory. Residential biomass burning was identified as the primary contribution source for xLVOCs and SVOCs, accounting for 70.1% and 42.2%, respectively. Industrial process was the main contributor for IVOCs and VOCs, accounting for 31.7% and 44.0% of their emissions, respectively. Meanwhile, the emission of volatile organic compound from different sources showed an increasing trend as volatility increased. The gas-phase emission was 212.1 kt, primarily from industrial process (33.9% contribution), while the particle-phase emission was 79.2 kt, mainly from domestic biomass combustion (65.0% contribution). xLVOCs and SVOCs emissions were mainly concentrated in cities with agricultural activities, such as Zhoukou, while IVOCs and VOCs were concentrated in highly industrialized and urbanized areas, such as Zhengzhou. It is hoped that the incompleteness of emission factors (EFs) for full-volatility organic compounds, which mainly contributes to the uncertainty of this study's results, can be further improved to better understand source contributions.

Mercury stable isotopes revealing the atmospheric mercury circulation: A review of particulate bound mercury in China,"Human activities since industrialization have significantly raised global atmospheric mercury (Hg) levels. China's high Hg emissions with rapid industrial development have a global impact on implementing the Minamata Convention on Mercury due to the dispersion of atmospheric Hg. Here, we comprehensively reviewed the atmospheric particulate bound mercury (PBM) in China, given its highest deposition rate, aiming to elucidate Hg sources, transformation, and geochemical cycles. Firstly, we analyzed its spatiotemporal distribution and long-term trends in China by synthesizing published literature. Most of the studies were conducted in eastern China, where PBM concentrations are higher than in western China due to extensive anthropogenic emissions. Furthermore, meteorological factors and atmospheric transport significantly affect seasonal PBM variations. Local anthropogenic sources, atmospheric transport, and local atmospheric transformation contribute 56.2%, 14.9%, and 29.0% to China's PBM content, respectively. Notably, China's atmospheric PBM concentrations have declined significantly since 2015. Secondly, we compiled a comprehensive global Hg isotope dataset and employed structural equation modeling to quantify Hg geochemical cycling. The isotope ratios of atmospheric Hg primarily overlap with those of Hg raw materials and vegetation. The significant relationship (P < 0.01) between atmospheric Hg and Hg raw materials (0.91) and vegetation (1.78) suggests that they contribute significantly to atmospheric Hg. Besides water and fish, atmospheric Hg also shows a high regression coefficient with human Hg, raising concerns about direct human inhalation of atmospheric Hg. Thirdly, we combined compiled Hg isotopes with machine learning to predict PBM sources in China. Industrial activities, biomass burning, and soil/dust are the primary contributors to PBM in China, accounting for 58.67%, 22.11%, and 17.14%, respectively. Our findings indicate that the contribution of soil/dust to PBM, ranging from 0.51% to 56.42%, has been underrated in previous studies. It is feasible to trace atmospheric Hg transport using Hg isotopes, as PBM mainly undergoes photoreduction reactions, but quantifying regional Hg transport remains challenging.

Assessing Fire Regimes in the Paraguayan Chaco: Implications for Ecological and Fire Management,"This study analyzed the fire regime in the highly diverse Paraguayan Chaco, focusing on different aspects of fire patterns, including spatial (area burned) and temporal (frequency) aspects and magnitude (severity). We focused on fire as it is a natural phenomenon that drives ecosystem change and has significant economic, ecological and social impacts of particular concern in vulnerable ecosystems. Using the K-means clustering technique, we identified four distinct fire regimes in the study region: High (H), Moderately High (MH), Moderately Low (ML) and Low (L). On the one hand, the Dry Chaco predominantly featured Low and Moderately High regimes, characterized by a low fire frequency due to arid conditions. On the other hand, the Humid Chaco was particularly affected by agricultural burning, driven by extensive livestock activity and higher biomass productivity. Finally, in the Pantanal, the variations in fire intensity were influenced by flood pulses and rainfall patterns. Our findings highlight the distinct fire regimes across the Paraguayan Chaco and detail the differences in the regimes. The studyâ€™s findings are valuable for developing efficient management strategies that account for fire behaviour during agricultural burning in this poorly studied region. Â© 2024 by the authors.",
"Analysis of the Influencing Factors and Sources of Brown Carbon Light Absorption in a Typical Megacity of the Yangtze River Delta, China","Brown carbon (BrC) is a new term for organic aerosol (OA) with strong absorption ability from the visible to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, which plays a vital role in atmospheric visibility and climate change. Herein, we report field measurements from 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021, sampled at urban Suzhou, Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, to investigate the optical properties and sources of BrC. By analyzing the seasonal characteristics of the absorption of BrC at 370 nm (babs370), babs370 was found to be the highest (9.0 Â± 7.2 Mmâˆ’1) in winter and the lowest (5.1 Â± 3.3 Mmâˆ’1) in summer, respectively. The absorption Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (AAE) value of BrC in winter was 1.22 Â± 0.05, followed by 1.21 Â± 0.05, 1.20 Â± 0.05, and 1.19 Â± 0.05 for fall, spring, and summer, respectively. The mass absorption cross-section (MAC) of secondary organic carbon (SOC) was 3.3 Â± 0.2 m2gâˆ’1 in spring, 2.9 Â± 0.1 m2gâˆ’1 in summer, 4.3 Â± 0.1 m2gâˆ’1 in fall, and 2.8 Â± 0.2 m2gâˆ’1 in winter, significantly lower than that of primary organic carbon (POC) at 370 nm, suggesting the aging process could weaken the light absorption of BrC. Five different BrC factors were identified by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, including biomass-burning-related, vehicle-related, sulfate-related, nitrate-related, and dust-related factors, which on average account for 7.4%, 73.4%, 11.9%, 1.9%, and 5.4% of babs370, respectively. Potential Source Contribution Factor (PSCF) analysis showed that those high babs370 periods were mainly contributed by air mass from the south. Moreover, for the influence degree of the potential source areas, the sequence was winter > spring > fall > summer. Our results improve the understanding of BrC in an important industrial city in YRD, which could reduce the uncertainty of the prediction of its climate effect in this region.

A Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Approaches for Fire Hotspots Prediction in Thailand,"Northern Thailand faces a recurring ecological threat: forest fires. These fires, prevalent during the dry season, spread rapidly and consume vital forest fuels. Human activities exacerbate the problem, with agricultural burning of forests, grasses, and crop residues contributing to the fire regime. These fires not only alter forest structure, but also produce harmful PM10 and PM2.5 particles that threaten public health. The purpose of this work is to perform a comparative analysis of two deep learning approaches, including single and hybrid, for fire hotspots prediction. The dataset was acquired from NASA's MODIS and VIIRS S-NPP satellite, covering the period from January 2012 to February 2024. The dataset values were pre-processed by coding and normalization. The pairwise correlation coefficient between each feature and the number of hotspots was calculated and then sorted in descending order. Based on these correlation values, a dimensionality reduction step was performed to reduce the number of features from 4 to 2 for each experiment. The prepared dataset was then divided into 80% and 20%. Four deep learning models were trained and three error metrics were used to objectively evaluate the model performance. The investigation showed that the single approach using LSTM algorithm had promising results in identifying fire hotspots in Thailand, especially when using data from the VIIRS S-NPP dataset with two or three attributes: confidence, bright-ti5, and frp or confident and bright-ti5.

Morphological and Elemental Classification of Freshly-Emitted Individual Particles From Field and Laboratory Residential Biomass Burning,"Residential biomass burning significantly contributes to air pollution in developing countries. However, the microscopic properties of individual particles in their emissions have not been well understood. In this study, individual primary particles from 14 kinds of biomass fuels (including firewood, crop residue, and animal dung) were collected in laboratory and field measurements, and their morphology, composition and mixing state were acquired using transmission electron microscope. These results constitute a source profile database of individual primary particles from residential biomass burning. The database reveals that different types of biomass fuels exhibit different emission characteristics, that is, residential firewood burning mainly emits pure carbonaceous particles (including organic matter (OM) and soot particles), crop residue burning mainly emits K-containing particles (including OM-K, soot(-OM)-K, and K-rich particles), and animal dung burning mainly emits pure carbonaceous particles and K-containing particles. Moreover, our results indicate that the emission characteristics obtained from laboratory and field measurements are different. Field measurements conducted in two selected villages in North China Plain exhibit a higher presence of soot particles compared to laboratory measurements, owing to their higher combustion temperatures. In contrast, field measurements conducted in one selected village in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau contain less soot particles than those from laboratory measurements in plain areas, due to the deficient oxygen supply during combustion process in the high-altitude regions. These results warn us that the emission estimation from residential biomass burning should notice the large emission differences among different biomass types and between field and laboratory measurements.

Extraction of tracer elements of particulate matter emission source using association rule mining,"The source marker species represent the emission source in the ambient air. It aids in identifying specific emission sources, but it can deliver ambiguous results when similar species exhibit different emission sources. Therefore, robust marker/tracer species are always needed to clearly identify emission source. This study collected tracer elemental species for possible emission sources from Indian published literature and processed them by using machine learning-based apriori algorithm to obtain robust elemental marker of the emission source. Initially, significant rules were chosen with support >10% and lift >1.0. Subsequently, elemental markers have obtained by applying constraint i.e. conviction â‰¥1.1, lift â‰¥1.4 and confidence â‰¥20%. As an outcome, it reveals elemental markers of crustal emission (CE) (Al, Si, Fe, Ca, Mg, Ti), sea salt (SS) (Na, K), biomass burning (BB) (K), solid waste burning (SWB) (Ba, Cd, Cr, Sr), coal combustion (CC) (As, Se, Cr, Cd), oil combustion (OC) (V, Ni, S, As), and traffic emission (TE) (Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn, Cd, Ni). Finally, robust elemental markers corresponding to their respective emission source were derived by applying constraint of conviction â‰¥1.1, lift â‰¥1.5 and confidence â‰¥50% on the previously extracted association rule. Consequently, it defined CE by Mg, Al, Ca, Si, Fe, SS by Na, K, TE by Cu, Pb, Mn, Zn, SWB by Ba, Cr, Cd, Sr, OC by V, Ni, S, and CC by Se, As. Additionally, this study also demonstrate the successful implementation of the apriori algorithm for the aforementioned task.

"Fire in highland grasslands in the Atlantic Forest Biome, a burned areas time series analysis and its correlation with the legislation","Fire has been an intrinsic ecological component of the ecosystems, affecting the public, economic, and socio-cultural policies of human-nature interactions. Using fire over grassland vegetation is a traditional practice for livestock in the highland grasslands and has economic and environmental consequences that have not yet been understood. A better description of the spatio-temporal biomass burning patterns is needed to analyze the effects of creation and application in these areas. This study used remote sensing techniques based on Sentinel-2 data and machine learning algorithms to identify burning scars and compare them with a national fire collection database for the highland grasslands in the Atlantic Forest Biome in Brazil. The aim is to evaluate public management tools and legislation evolution during the 35Â years of the time series analyzed. The results indicated that 12,285Â ha of grasslands were converted to other uses, losing about 24% of their original formation, with 10% occurring after banned this practice in 2008. The burned areas classification using the Random Forest algorithm obtained an AUC = 0.9983. Divergences in the burned areaâ€™s extent and frequency were found between the municipalityâ€™s authorized license and those classified as burned. On average, only 43% of the burned area in the Parque Estadual do Tainhas and its buffer zone had an environmental permit in the last 5Â years. This researchâ€™s results provide subsidies for revising and creating public policies and consequently help territorial management. Copyright Â© 2023 Herrmann, Nascimento, Freitas and Ometto.",
"Source apportionment of fine particulate matter at a megacity in China, using an improved regularization supervised PMF model","The source apportionment of particulate matter plays an important role in solving the atmospheric particulate pollution. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) is a widely used source apportionment model. At present, high resolution online datasets are increasingly rich, but acquiring accurate and timely source apportionment results is still challenging. Integrating prior knowledge into modelling process is an effective solution and can yield reliable results. This study proposed an improved source apportionment method for the regularization supervised PMF model (RSPMF). This method leveraged actual source profile to guide factor profile for rapidly and automatically identifying source categories and quantifying source contributions. The results showed that the factor profile from RSPMF could be interpreted as seven factors and approach to actual source profile. Average source contributions were also an agreement between RSPMF and EPAPMF, including secondary nitrate (26 %, 27 %), secondary sulfate (23 %, 24 %), coal combustion (18 %, 18 %), vehicle exhaust (15 %, 15 %), biomass burning (10 %, 9 %), dust (5 %, 4 %), industrial emission (3 %, 3 %). The solutions of RSPMF also exhibited good generalizability during different episodes. This study reveals the superiority of supervised model, this model embeds prior knowledge into modelling process to guide model for obtaining more reliable results. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.",
"Variation of Aerosol Optical Properties over Cluj-Napoca, Romania, Based on 10 Years of AERONET Data and MODIS MAIAC AOD Product","Aerosols play an important role in Earthâ€™s climate system, and thus long-time ground- based measurements of aerosol optical properties are useful in understanding this role. Ten years of quality-assured measurements between 2010 and 2020 are used to investigate the aerosol climatology in the Cluj-Napoca area, in North-Western Romania. In this study, we analyze the aerosol optical depth (AOD), single scattering albedo (SSA) and angstrom exponent obtained by the CIMEL sun photometer, part of the aerosol robotic network (AERONET), to extract the seasonality of aerosols in the region and investigate the aerosol climatology of the area. Higher aerosol loads are found during July and August. The angstrom exponent has the lowest values in April and May, and the highest in August. The classification of aerosols using AERONET data is performed to separate dust, biomass burning, polluted urban, marine and continental-dominant aerosol mixtures. In addition, the study presents the validation efforts of the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) dataset against AERONET AOD over a 10-year period. Â© 2023 by the authors.",
Using machine learning to quantify sources of light-absorbing water-soluble humic-like substances (HULISws) in Northeast China,"Water-soluble humic-like substances (HULISws) are a group of heterogeneous organic compounds in the atmosphere, greatly impacting climate change and human health. As the most significant biomass burning (BB) and fossil fuel burning polluted area in China, Northeast China Plain could generate more light absorbing HULISws to the atmosphere. In this work, daily fine particle (PM2.5) samples were collected in Changchun, located in Northeast China Plain, from October 17th to November 29th, 2016, to investigate the potential sources of optical properties of HULISws. Here, the whole sampling period was divided into three sub-periods using the density of fire spots and the timeline of the central heating: the non-heating (October 17th to October 24th), early heating (October 25th to November 13th), and normal heating (November 14th to November 29th) periods. The mean mass concentrations of HULISws were 4.2 Â± 1.2, 8.6 Â± 3.6, and 2.4 Â± 1.3 Î¼g mâˆ’3 during the non-heating, early heating, and normal heating periods, respectively. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model results suggested that the contribution of primary BB, secondary BB, and fossil fuel burning emissions were 46%, 24%, and 19% during the non-heating period, 22%, 29%, and 17% during the early heating period, and 13%, 16%, and 50% during the normal heating period, respectively. Combining the PMF results with the random forest (RF) algorithm, the contribution of each source to the optical properties was quantified. Here, BB still dominated the optical properties of HULISws in Northeast China. During the study period, the primary BB and secondary BB contributed 25% and 34% in the light absorption coefficient (Abs), 22% and 33% in the mass absorption exponent (MAE), and 17% and 33% in the absorption Ã…ngstrÃ¶m exponent (AAE), respectively. Other sources like cooking and fossil combustion contributed 25% and 35% in Abs, 35% and 26% in MAE, and 16% and 33% in AAE, respectively. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd",
"Development of current and future high-resolution gridded emission inventory of anthropogenic air pollutants for urban air quality studies in Hanoi, Vietnam","A high-resolution (1 km Ã— 1 km) emission inventory was developed for Hanoi for 2017 and 2018. The total annual emissions of PM2.5, BC, OC, NOx, SO2, NMVOC, NH3, CH4, and CO were 14.9, 1.6, 2.9, 56.7, 19.1, 109.2, 23.0, 37.9, and 472.7 Gg, respectively. Transportation, industry, and agriculture contributed 89.1%, 92.2%, and 81.3% to the total emissions of PM2.5, BC, and OC, respectively. Transportation contributed 72.4%, 52.1%, and 72.5% to the emissions of NOx, NMVOC, and CO, respectively. Industry contributed 64.9% to the emissions of SO2. Agriculture was a major source of NH3 and CH4, contributing 84.2% and 76.6%, respectively. Future emissions of select sectors were estimated for 2030. The emissions from transportation can increase in the range of 26.9% (CH4) to 245.8% (NH3), despite the consideration of the EURO 5 standard. For domestic cooking, transitioning from coal to liquefied petroleum gas can help reduce the emissions of most pollutants in the range of 10.4% (NH3) to 52.6% (OC), except NOx and NMVOC. The crop residue burning (CRB) ban could reduce emissions in the range of 0.27 Gg (SO2) to 138.4 Gg (CO) in 2030, respectively. The study can help policy-makers to develop strategies for air pollution mitigation in developing economies such as Hanoi. Â© 2022",
"Aerosols over East and South Asia: Type Identification, Optical Properties, and Implications for Radiative Forcing","Identification of aerosol types has long been a difficult problem over East and South Asia due to various limitations. In this study, we use 2-dimensional (2-D) and multi-dimensional Mahalanobis distance (MD) clustering algorithms to identify aerosol characteristics based on the data from the Aerosol Robotic Network from March 1998 to February 2018 over the South and East Asian region (10â—¦ N~50â—¦ N, 70â—¦ E~135â—¦ E). The single scattering albedo (SSA), absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE), extinction Angstrom exponent (EAE), real index of refraction (RRI), and imaginary index of refraction (IRI) are utilized for classification of aerosols. Sub-regions with similar background conditions over East and South Asia are identified by hierarchical clustering algorithm to illustrate distinctive meteorological states in different areas. The East and South Asian aerosols are found to have distinct regional and seasonal features relating to the meteorological conditions, land cover, and industrial infrastructure. It is found that the proportions of dust aerosol are the highest in spring at the SACOL site and in summer at the sites near the Northern Indo-Gangetic Plain area. In spring, biomass-burning aerosols are dominant over the central Indo-China Peninsula area. The aerosol characteristics at coastal sites are also analyzed and compared with previous results. The 2-D clustering method is useful when limited aerosol parameters are available, but the results are highly dependent on the sets of parameters used for identification. Comparatively, the MD method, which considers multiple aerosol parameters, could provide more comprehensive classification of aerosol types. It is estimated that only about 50% of the data samples that are identifiable by the MD method could be classified by the 2-D methods, and a lot of undetermined data samples could be mis-classified by the 2-D methods. The aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) and the aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) of various aerosol types at the top and the bottom of the atmosphere (TOA and BOA) are determined based on the MD aerosol classification. The dust aerosols are found to have the largest ARF at the TOA (âˆ’36 W/m2 ), followed by the urban/industrial aerosols and biomass-burning aerosols. The ARFE of biomass-burning aerosols at the BOA (âˆ’165 W/m2 /AOD550nm ) is the strongest among those of the other aerosol types. The comparison of the results by MD and 2-D methods shows that the differences in ARF and ARFE are generally within 10%. Our results indicate the importance of aerosol type classification in accurately attributing the radiative contributions of different aerosol components. Â© 2022 by the authors.

An aerosol classification scheme for global simulations using the K-means machine learning method,"The K-means machine learning algorithm is applied to climatological data of seven aerosol properties from a global aerosol simulation using EMAC-MADE3. The aim is to partition the aerosol properties across the global atmosphere in specific aerosol regimes; this is done mainly for evaluation purposes. K-means is an unsupervised machine learning method with the advantage that an a priori definition of the aerosol classes is not required. Using K-means, we are able to quantitatively define global aerosol regimes, so-called aerosol clusters, and explain their internal properties and their location and extension. This analysis shows that aerosol regimes in the lower troposphere are strongly influenced by emissions. Key drivers of the clusters' internal properties and spatial distribution are, for instance, pollutants from biomass burning and biogenic sources, mineral dust, anthropogenic pollution, and corresponding mixtures. Several continental clusters propagate into oceanic regions as a result of long-range transport of air masses. The identified oceanic regimes show a higher degree of pollution in the Northern Hemisphere than over the southern oceans. With increasing altitude, the aerosol regimes propagate from emission-induced clusters in the lower troposphere to roughly zonally distributed regimes in the middle troposphere and in the tropopause region. Notably, three polluted clusters identified over Africa, India, and eastern China cover the whole atmospheric column from the lower troposphere to the tropopause region. The results of this analysis need to be interpreted taking the limitations and strengths of global aerosol models into consideration. On the one hand, global aerosol simulations cannot estimate small-scale and localized processes due to the coarse resolution. On the other hand, they capture the spatial pattern of aerosol properties on the global scale, implying that the clustering results could provide useful insights for aerosol research. To estimate the uncertainties inherent in the applied clustering method, two sensitivity tests have been conducted (i) to investigate how various data scaling procedures could affect the K-means classification and (ii) to compare K-means with another unsupervised classification algorithm (HAC, i.e. hierarchical agglomerative clustering). The results show that the standardization based on sample mean and standard deviation is the most appropriate standardization method for this study, as it keeps the underlying distribution of the raw data set and retains the information of outliers. The two clustering algorithms provide similar classification results, supporting the robustness of our conclusions. The classification procedures presented in this study have a markedly wide application potential for future model-based aerosol studies. Â© Copyright: ",
Ground-based investigation of HOxand ozone chemistry in biomass burning plumes in rural Idaho,"Ozone (O3), a potent greenhouse gas that is detrimental to human health, is typically found in elevated concentrations within biomass burning (BB) smoke plumes. The radical species OH, HO2, and RO2 (known collectively as ROx) have central roles in the formation of secondary pollutants including O3 but are poorly characterized for BB plumes. We present measurements of total peroxy radical concentrations ([XO2]Â¯[HO2]+[RO2]) and additional trace-gas and particulate matter measurements from McCall, Idaho, during August 2018. There were five distinct periods in which BB smoke impacted this site. During BB events, O3 concentrations were enhanced, evident by ozone enhancement ratios (Î´O3/Î´CO) that ranged up to 0.06ppbvppbv-1. [XO2] was similarly elevated during some BB events. Overall, instantaneous ozone production rates (P(O3)) were minimally impacted by the presence of smoke as [NOx] enhancements were minimal. Measured XO2 concentrations were compared to zero-dimensional box modeling results to evaluate the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) and GEOS-Chem mechanisms overall and during periods of BB influence. The models consistently overestimated XO2 with the base MCM and GEOS-Chem XO2 predictions high by an average of 28% and 20%, respectively. One period of BB influence had distinct measured enhancements of 15pptv XO2 that were not reflected in the model output, likely due to the presence of unmeasured HOx sources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BB study featuring peroxy radical measurements. Â© 2022 Andrew J. Lindsay et al.",
"Fuel consumption rates in resprouting eucalypt forest during hazard reduction burns, cultural burns and wildfires","Accurate estimation of emissions from biomass burning and their impact on carbon storage requires pre and post-fire plot measurement of fuel consumption across a range of forest types and fire severities, and this information is currently far from comprehensive in Australia or elsewhere. We measured fine and coarse fuels in 44 sites before and after 20 fires including cultural burns, hazard reduction burns and wildfires in resprouting dry sclerophyll (eucalypt) forests in the Sydney region of Australia. We compared consumption among the classes of fire severity and fire types. Most of the fires removed the great majority of fine litter and near surface fuels (mean 68% and 94% respectively) but a smaller and more variable percentage of other fine components and coarse fuels. Consumption was largely a function of pre-fire fuel levels. However, percentage consumption varied according to fire severity. Remaining fuel was negatively, and fresh fuel (i.e. immediate post-fire inputs) positively related to fire severity so that the two were in balance for litter, twigs and coarse woody debris. A higher proportion of twigs and coarse woody debris were consumed in hazard reduction and wildfires than in cultural burns, and more canopy and tree wood was consumed in wildfire than the other fire types. Total fuel consumption was 12.8 t haâˆ’1 (13% of pre-fire) in cultural burns, 75.7 t haâˆ’1 (27%) in hazard reductions, and 123.5 t haâˆ’1 (38%) in wildfires. This was dominated by tree biomass consumption (69% of total). Our estimates for hazard reduction burns are higher than most previous studies from Australian forests, probably because our fires spanned a greater range of severities. Our study provides a benchmark for estimating fire emissions and carbon dynamics for the region and will contribute to improving predictions of the impact of hazard reduction burns on fire behaviour and smoke emissions.

Quantifying the Influence of a Burn Event on Ammonia Concentrations Using a Machine-Learning Technique,"Although combustion is considered a common source of ammonia (NH3) in the atmo-sphere, field measurements quantifying such emissions of NH3 are still lacking. In this study, online measurements of NH3 were performed by a cavity ring-down spectrometer, in the cold season at a rural site in Xianghe on the North China Plain. We found that the NH3 concentrations were mostly below 65 ppb during the study period. However, from 18 to 21 November 2017, a close burn event (~100 m) increased the NH3 concentrations to 145.6 Â± 139.9 ppb. Using a machine-learning technique, we quantified that this burn event caused a significant increase in NH3 concentrations by 411%, compared with the scenario without the burn event. In addition, the ratio of âˆ†NH3 /âˆ†CO during the burn period was 0.016, which fell in the range of biomass burning. Future investigations are needed to evaluate the impacts of the NH3 combustion sources on air quality, ecosystems, and climate in the context of increasing burn events worldwide.

Sea Salt Aerosol Identification Based on Multispectral Optical Properties and Its Impact on Radiative Forcing over the Ocean,"The ground-based measurement of sea salt (SS) aerosol over the ocean requires the massive utilization of satellite-derived aerosol products. In this study, n-order spectral derivatives of aerosol optical depth (AOD) based on wavelength were examined to characterize SS and other aerosol types in terms of their spectral dependence related to their optical properties such as particle size distributions and complex refractive indices. Based on theoretical simulations from the second simulation of a satellite signal in the solar spectrum (6S) model, AOD spectral derivatives of SS were characterized along with other major types including mineral dust (DS), biomass burning (BB), and anthropogenic pollutants (APs). The approach (normalized derivative aerosol index, NDAI) of partitioning aerosol types with intrinsic values of particle size distribution and complex refractive index from normalized first-and second-order derivatives was applied to the datasets from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) as well as by the ground-based aerosol robotic network (AERONET). The results after implementation from multiple sources of data indicated that the proposed approach could be highly effective for identifying and segregating abundant SS from DS, BB, and AP, across an ocean. Consequently, each aerosolâ€™s shortwave radiative forcing and its efficiency could be further estimated in order to predict its impact on the climate. Â© 2022 by the authors.

"Compositions, source apportionment and health risks assessment of fine particulate matter in naturally-ventilated schools","Good indoor air quality in school environment is crucial for teaching and learning processes, as well as student development. This study aims to identify the composition of PM2.5 and the main sources of it which influence the indoor and outdoor school environment. The PM2.5 sampling was conducted using a portable low volume air sampler and took place at three different primary schools. The chemical composition of PM2.5 is comprised of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) and potentially toxic trace metals. WSII (Clâˆ’, NO3âˆ’, SO42âˆ’, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) were analysed using ion chromatography (IC) and trace metals concentrations (Al, Fe, Zn, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Ni, As, Co, Cd) using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that the highest average for PM2.5 concentrations in an indoor classroom was recorded at the school located in the industrial area (23.5 Î¼g/m3) followed by urban (18.6 Î¼g/m3) and suburban (9.58 Î¼g/m3). The indoor to outdoor (I/O) ratio values for PM2.5 concentrations were slightly above one, indicating that open doors and windows highly affected indoor PM2.5 concentrations. Source apportionment analysis indicated that the sources of both indoor and outdoor PM2.5 were mixed of natural (crustal, mineral dust and sea salt) and anthropogenic (vehicle, industrial and biomass burning). The hazard quotient (HQ) value was lower than the acceptable limits. The excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) value for all three stations, however, was found to be slightly higher than the acceptable level (1.0E-06) for Cr and Ni.

Identification and spatiotemporal distribution analysis of global biomass burning based on Suomi-NPP VIIRS Nightfire data,"Biomass burning refers to the combustion of various organisms formed through photosynthesis, including natural and man-made biomass burning. Biomass combustion has great impacts on nature and human health. Biomass combustion and industrial heat sources overlap in temperature range, it is difficult to distinguish them with traditional methods. In order to explore the distribution of biomass combustion, the influence of industrial heat sources must be eliminated. This paper used Suomi-NPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) Nightfire data to extract 1,457,930 global biomass combustion objects from 2012 to 2018 based on the spatial distribution, occurrence frequency and duration characteristics of biomass combustion. The extracted results were verified using industrial directory Point of Interest (POI) data obtained online from high-resolution remote sensing images and place name maps, and the results showed that 98.37% of the industrial heat sources were successfully removed. The spatial and temporal characteristics of biomass combustion in regions with varying levels of economic development at the intercontinental, international and global levels from 2012 to 2018 were revealed in this paper. It also compares the temporal and spatial differences in biomass burning among different climate zones and land cover types from 2012 to 2018. Overall, global biomass burning showed an upward trend from 2012 to 2018 and increased significantly from 2015 to 2016. Global biomass combustion was mostly distributed in Africa, followed by Oceania and South America. Australia, Brazil, Russia, the United States and Canada were the five countries with the most biomass burning. The proportions of biomass burning in different climatic zones and land cover types also showed obvious regularity. Biomass combustion mostly occurred in low-latitude and high-temperature areas and in areas where the land cover types included shrublands, grasslands and farmlands. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd",
Novel Application of Machine Learning Techniques for Rapid Source Apportionment of Aerosol Mass Spectrometer Datasets,"We apply machine learning approaches sparse multinomial logistic regression to classify aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) unit mass resolution (UMR) data followed by an ensemble regression technique for source apportionment of organic aerosols (OA). The classifier was trained on 60 well characterized laboratory and positive matrix factorization (PMF) deconvolved reference spectra to identify eight OA types. These include four laboratory-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) spectra, which include isoprene photooxidation SOA, isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) SOA, a monoterpene SOA type that includes Î±-pinene and Î²-pinene SOA, and aromatic SOA from oxidation of naphthalene and m-xylene precursors, as well as PMF deconvolved spectra for three primary organic aerosol (POA) types, namely, hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA), biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA), and cooking OA (COA), and a more oxidized oxygenated OA type (MO-OOA). A 5-fold cross-validation strategy, repeated 10 times, was used to assess the classifier's performance. The classifier had high classification accuracy for COA, aromatic SOA, and isoprene SOA spectra but incorrectly classified âˆ¼9% by number of MO-OOA spectra as BBOA, 12% of BBOA spectra as HOA (and vice versa), and 18% of IEPOX-SOA spectra as aromatic SOA. Next, an ensemble regression model was trained on an artificially generated dataset consisting of mixtures of different OA types to assess its ability to predict fractional mass abundances from classification probabilities of various OA species obtained from the multinomial logistic regression classifier trained on the reference spectra. Ultimately, the proposed approach was applied for source apportionment of aircraft-based AMS measurements of OA UMR spectra during the HI-SCALE field campaign. On two representative days (May 6th and 18th, 2016), the algorithm determined that âˆ¼50-60% of OA by mass was MO-OOA, which represented a highly aged organic aerosol mixture from different sources. On both days, BBOA was determined to contribute less than 10% to OA by mass. However, on May 18th, the aromatic SOA fraction was higher compared to that on May 6th. The proposed approach is capable of rapidly analyzing AMS data in real time, making it suitable for applications where rapid source apportionment of AMS OA spectra is desirable.

Inferring Polluted Asian Absorbing Aerosol Properties Using Decadal Scale AERONET Measurements and a MIE Model,"Absorbing aerosols uniquely impact radiation, aerosol transport, and meteorology. This paper quantifies black carbon core and sulphate shell size and mass using decadal measurements of multi-spectral aerosol optical depth, single scattering albedo, and angstrom exponent from Aerosol Robotic Network stations located throughout East, Southeast, and South Asia, in connection with a MIE model. All sites are uniquely characterized into four types: urban, biomass burning, long-range transport, and clean. Unique size and mass probability distributions of both the core and shell are calculated within each classification. Well known urban, biomass burning, and clean sites are all properly identified. Furthermore, two unique sites previously thought to not have multiple characteristics are identified, with urban and biomass burning significant in Beijing and long-range transport significant in the otherwise clean South China Sea at Taiping Island. It is hoped that these results will allow for advances in attribution and radiative forcing studies. Â© 2021 The Authors.",
"Variability in aerosols properties and sources over rohtak, India","Aerosols are crucial species in climate-related studies due to their significant impacts on radiative forcing. In the present study, Sky-radiometer POM-2 data was used to investigate the source of daily and monthly variability in aerosol properties over Rohtak city for the period from June, 2012-May, 2014. The annual mean values of AOD, Alpha, SSA and ASY were 0.71 Â± 0.36, 0.74 Â± 0.35, 0.93 Â± 0.05 and 0.71 Â± 0.02, respectively for the entire study period. The higher value of AOD and the lower value of Alpha during pre-monsoon months indicated the dominance of coarse mode dust particles. During November month, the lower value of SSA (0.84 Â± 0.01) suggesting the dominance of absorbing type aerosol which may be associated with the burning of paddy crop residue and firecrackers on Diwali festival, in North-Western India. Another crucial parameter for the aerosol study in volume size distribution which exhibits a bimodal distribution with the first peak at ~0.20 Âµm for fine mode particles and a second peak at ~ 5 Âµm for coarse mode particles. Aerosols are classified into four categories by using the ratio of AOD and Alpha: Dust Dominated (DD), Biomass Burning (BB), Anthropogenic Aerosol (AA) and Mixed Type (MT). Dust dominated (DD) aerosols are found maximum during pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons with a fraction of about 26.4% and 19.8%, respectively. Biomass burning (BB) type aerosols are dominant during the post-monsoon and winter seasons with a fraction of 34% and 30%, respectively. Â© 2021, India Meteorological Department.

"Disparities in particulate matter (PM10) origins and oxidative potential at a city scale (Grenoble, France) - Part 2: Sources of PM10 oxidative potential using multiple linear regression analysis and the predictive applicability of multilayer perceptron neural network analysis","The oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) measures PM capability to potentially cause anti-oxidant imbalance. Due to the wide range and complex mixture of species in particulates, little is known about the pollution sources most strongly contributing to OP. A 1-year sampling of PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter below 10) was performed over different sites in a medium-sized city (Grenoble, France). An enhanced fine-scale apportionment of PM10 sources, based on the chemical composition, was performed using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) method and reported in a companion paper (Borlaza et al., 2020). OP was assessed as the ability of PM10 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) using three different acellular assays: dithiothreitol (DTT), ascorbic acid (AA), and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) assays. Using multiple linear regression (MLR), the OP contributions of the sources identified by PMF were estimated. Conversely, since atmospheric processes are usually non-linear in nature, artificial neural network (ANN) techniques, which employ non-linear models, could further improve estimates. Hence, the multilayer perceptron analysis (MLP), an ANN-based model, was additionally used to model OP based on PMF-resolved sources as well. This study presents the spatiotemporal variabilities of OP activity with influences by season-specific sources, site typology and specific local features, and assay sensitivity. Overall, both MLR and MLP effectively captured the evolution of OP. The primary traffic and biomass burning sources were the strongest drivers of OP in the Grenoble basin. There is also a clear redistribution of source-specific impacts when using OP instead of mass concentration, underlining the importance of PM redox activity for the identification of potential sources of PM toxicity. Finally, the MLP generally offered improvements in OP prediction, especially for sites where synergistic and/or antagonistic effects between sources are prominent, supporting the value of using ANN-based models to account for the non-linear dynamics behind the atmospheric processes affecting OP of PM10.

Determination of lidar ratio for major aerosol types over western north pacific based on long-term MPLNET data,"East Asia is the most complex region in the world for aerosol studies, as it encounters a lot of varieties of aerosols, and aerosol classification can be a challenge in this region. In the present study, we focused on the relationship between aerosol types and aerosol optical properties. We analyzed the long-term (2005-2012) data of vertical profiles of aerosol extinction coefficients, lidar ratio (Sp), and other aerosol optical properties obtained from a NASA Micro-Pulse Lidar Network and Aerosol Robotic Network site in northern Taiwan, which frequently receives Asian continental outflows. Based on aerosol extinction vertical profiles, the profiles were classified into two types: type 1 (single-layer structure) and type 2 (two-layer structure). Fall season (October-November) was the prevailing season for the Type 1, whereas type 2 mainly happened in spring (March-April). In type 1, air masses normally originated from three regional sectors, i.e., Asia continental (AC), Pacific Ocean (PO), and Southeast Asia (SA). The mean Sp values were 39 Â± 17 sr, 30 Â± 12 sr, and 38 Â± 18 sr for the AC, PO, and SA sectors, respectively. The Sp results suggested that aerosols from the AC sector contained dust and anthropogenic particles, and aerosols from the PO sector were most likely sea salts. We further combined the EPA dust event database and backward trajectory analysis for type 2. Results showed that Sp was 41 Â± 14 sr and 53 Â± 21 sr for dust storm and biomass-burning events, respectively. The Sp for biomass-burning events in type 2 showed two peaks patterns. The first peak occurred within range of 30-50 sr corresponding to urban pollutant, and the second peak occurred within range of 60-80 sr in relation to biomass burning. Finally, our study summarized the Sp values for four major aerosol types over northern Taiwan, viz., urban (42 Â± 18 sr), dust (34 Â± 6 sr), biomass-burning (69 Â± 12 sr), and oceanic (30 Â± 12 sr). Our findings provide useful references for aerosol classification and air pollution identification over the western North Pacific. Â©",
Size-resolved characterization of organic aerosol in the North China Plain: New insights from high resolution spectral analysis,"Organic aerosol (OA), a large fraction of fine particles, has a large impact on climate radiative forcing and human health, and the impact depends strongly on size distributions. Here we conducted size-resolved OA measurements using a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer at urban and rural sites in the North China Plain (NCP) in summer and winter. Our results showed substantially different size distributions of OA with the diameters peaking at âˆ¼550 nm in summer, and 420 nm and 350 nm at urban and rural sites, respectively, during wintertime. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) of size-resolved high-resolution mass spectra of OA resolved various OA factors at urban and rural sites. In particular, we found that the mass spectra of the same type of secondary OA (SOA) from bulk PMF analysis can be largely different across different sizes. Biomass burning OA (BBOA) and fossil-fuel-related OA (FFOA) showed broad size distributions peaking at 350 nm in winter at the rural site, where primary OA (POA BBOA + FFOA) dominated OA across different sizes. Comparatively, secondary OA (SOA) in the NCP peaked at âˆ¼400-500 nm during wintertime, and âˆ¼500-650 nm in summer. SOA played an enhanced role during more severely polluted days with peak diameters shifting to larger sizes, while the changes in POA size distributions were small. The size-resolved oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratios were also determined and linked with the hygroscopicity parameter of OA (kOA). The results showed that kOA increased substantially with particle size, with higher values in summer in Beijing (0.28 Â± 0.021) than those during wintertime (0.17 Â± 0.019 and 0.12 Â± 0.018). The size-resolved kOA would benefit a better prediction of cloud condensation nuclei than bulk kOA in future studies. Â© 2021 Environmental Science: Atmospheres. All right reserved.",
Experimental manipulation of fuel structure to evaluate the potential ecological effects of fire,"A better understanding of how dominant fuels affect fire behavior can improve predictions and comparisons of the ecological effects of fires in forests and other ecosystems. Current methods for evaluating effects of fuel characteristics on fire behavior, including maximum temperature and heating duration, range from small-scale laboratory to large-scale field experiments. Small-scale experiments often have many replicates and high measurement precision but can lack realism, while field experiments may have few replicates and lower measurement precision, thereby making comparisons across ecosystems difficult. Here, we present a method to experimentally evaluate ecological effects of fire while maintaining realism in fuel structure. We applied the method to investigate fire behavior effects of cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), an invasive grass with a vertical growth form that is widespread across Southeast US forests. Examining the effect of fuel structure (piled vs. standing) on fire behavior for a range of fuel loads illustrated how more realistic standing fuels produced shorter heating duration (s above 100 Â°C), taller flame heights, and faster spread rates compared to piled fuels. Average heating duration was ~2â€“4 times longer and ranged more widely when fuels were piled (80â€“277 s) compared to standing (41â€“57 s). Flame heights were ~1.4 times taller when fuels were standing than piled. These differences highlight that maintaining natural fuel structure in experimental fires produces more realistic estimates of fire behavior and effects. Consequently, not maintaining realistic vertical fuel structure could lead to overestimation of potential fire impacts related to temperature (e.g., tissue damage) but underestimate potential impacts related to flame heights, such as total engulfment of tree seedlings and saplings by fire. Altogether, our method effectively maintained fuel structure, enabling assessment of more probable fire behavior and impacts of the invasive grass than if fuels were simply piled. This approach may help further bridge the gap in realism between small-scale experiments and large-scale fires, enabling comparisons of the ecological effects of fires and fire-invasion interactions across forest ecosystems.

"Source identification of fine and coarse aerosol during smog episodes in Debrecen, Hungary","In this study, the identification of PM sources during smog episodes in Debrecen is presented. The smog episodes were characterized by the high concentration of PM10, and were linked to a thermal inversion period in November 2011 in Hungary, when an anticyclone occurred across Europe. The sources of PM2.5 and PMcoarse were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF). Additionally, the source locations were explored by using the conditional probability function (CPF). A numerical weather prediction model (WRF) was also applied to evaluate the air pollution situation. In order to meet the goals of the study, the elemental composition with high (2-h) time resolution, the elemental size distribution, and the planetary boundary layer were examined in an urban background site of downtown Debrecen, Hungary. Our results highlight the importance of biomass burning (39%) and traffic (31%) as the major contributors to PM2.5. The main tracers of these sources (K, Cl, Pb, Zn) appeared mainly in droplet mode (0.5â€“1 Î¼m). The major sources of PMcoarse fraction were soil (32%), and dust attributed to tramline construction (30%). The combination of PMF and CPF results revealed that the PM10 concentrations were affected by sources within the urban agglomeration of Debrecen (city centre and suburban areas) under the given meteorological conditions. This conclusion is further validated by the fact that the diurnal variation of the identified source contributions presented a distinct pattern that depended strongly on the daily activities of the cityâ€™s residents (compared to the usually unstructured diurnals of transported sources).

Biomass burning organic aerosol from prescribed burning and other activities in the United States,"A three-dimensional chemical transport model, PMCAMx-SR, was applied in the continental U.S. to investigate the contribution of prescribed burning and other biomass burning sources to the total organic aerosol (OA) concentrations. Simulations were performed during three seasonally-representative months (April, July and September 2008). Prescribed biomass burning organic aerosol (bbOA) emission rates were estimated to be approximately 300, 80 and 250 tn dâˆ’1 during April, July and September respectively. Prescribed burning was limited during July due to the prevailing weather conditions. Prescribed burning is responsible for 45% of the total bbOA emissions during the simulated spring period, 20% during the fall, and just 3% during the summer. The predicted maximum hourly prescribed bbOA concentration reached approximately 100 Î¼g mâˆ’3 during April in South Carolina and during September in New Mexico, whereas it was less than 15 Î¼g mâˆ’3 during July in Arkansas. The average contribution of prescribed burning to OA in the continental U.S. is quite low (less than 5%) and 60â€“70% is predicted to be secondary OA. Biomass burning secondary organic aerosol (bbSOA) levels far away from the prescribed fires are predicted to exceed 2 Î¼g mâˆ’3. In states with intensive prescribed burning activities this source is predicted to contribute 20â€“40% of the OA on a monthly average basis. In these states (for example South Carolina during April), the predictions reveal that people can be exposed for 20 h per month on average to bbOA levels exceeding 5 Î¼g mâˆ’3 and for 200 h to levels above 0.5 Î¼g mâˆ’3. This should be contrasted to 220 h of exposure to bbOA above 5 Î¼g mâˆ’3 and 650 h to bbOA above 0.5 Î¼g mâˆ’3 for states and periods with intense wild fires (for example California during July).

"High-resolution emission inventory of gaseous and particulate pollutants in Shandong Province, eastern China","To characterize the anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, VOCs, NOx, SO2, and CO) in Shandong Province, eastern China, the high-resolution emission inventories were developed using the â€œbottom-upâ€ methodology. The emission sources were categorized to biomass burning, dust, fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, solvent utilization, waste disposal, and on-road vehicles, with five-level classification and 399 subclasses. Emission factors were collected from China's guidelines on the emissions of atmospheric pollutants and literatures with local measurements. Particularly, those for on-road vehicles were calculated by COPERT v5. The county-level activity data were obtained from the governmental statistics. Results showed that the estimated anthropogenic emissions of PM2.5, PM10, VOCs, NOx, SO2, and CO in Shandong Province in 2016 were 5136.8, 5685.4, 3257.1, 1430.6, 240.6, and 19618.8 kt, respectively. The main emission source of PM2.5 and PM10 were dust and it was industrial processes for VOCs and CO. On-road vehicles and fossil fuel combustion contributed the most to NOx and SO2 emissions, respectively. The composition of emissions by sources for each pollutant differed among cities. Emissions in Shandong displayed remarkable spatial variations, with the highest in the central, southern, and coastal areas. This study could be expected to supply sufficient information and basic data for formulating effective environmental management policies and further improving the air quality in Shandong Province and even in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.

Fire alters the availability of soil nutrients and accelerates growth of Eucalyptus grandis in Zambia,"Fire has been used to prepare land during tree plantation establishment for many years but uncertainty about how ecosystems respond to prescribed burning makes it difficult to predict the effects of fire on soil nutrients. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of burning accumulated forest residues (slash) on soil chemical properties and how trees respond. We analyzed 40 burned and unburned sites and compared growth of Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden between sites. Soil pH increased by 39% after fire, suggesting reduced soil acidity and increased liming. Total nitrogen increased by 100%; other nutrients (Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+) also increased. Increase in nutrients had a significant effect on the growth of E. grandis; larger and taller trees were associated more with burned than unburned sites. This study provides evidence that burning accumulated slash during land preparation prior to plantation establishment alters soil nutrient status and enhances the growth of E. grandis.

Organic aerosol volatility and viscosity in the North China Plain: Contrast between summer and winter,"Volatility and viscosity have substantial impacts on gas-particle partitioning, formation and evolution of aerosol and hence the predictions of aerosol-related air quality and climate effects. Here aerosol volatility and viscosity at a rural site (Gucheng) and an urban site (Beijing) in the North China Plain (NCP) in summer and winter were investigated by using a thermodenuder coupled with a highresolution aerosol mass spectrometer. The effective saturation concentration (C) of organic aerosol (OA) in summer was smaller than that in winter (0.55 Î¼gm-3 vs. 0.71- 0.75 Î¼gm-3), indicating that OA in winter in the NCP is more volatile due to enhanced primary emissions from coal combustion and biomass burning. The volatility distributions varied and were largely different among different OA factors. In particular, we found that hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) contained more nonvolatile compounds compared to coalcombustion- related OA. The more oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA) showed overall lower volatility than less oxidized OOA (LO-OOA) in both summer and winter, yet the volatility of MO-OOA was found to be relative humidity (RH) dependent showing more volatile properties at higher RH. Our results demonstrated the different composition and chemical formation pathways of MO-OOA under different RH levels. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and viscosity of OA in summer and winter are estimated using the recently developed parameterization formula. Our results showed that the Tg of OA in summer in Beijing (291.5 K) was higher than that in winter (289.7-290.0 K), while it varied greatly among different OA factors. The viscosity suggested that OA existed mainly as solid in winter in Beijing (RHD29-17 %), but as semisolids in Beijing in summer (RHD48-25 %) and Gucheng in winter (RHD68-24 %). These results have the important implication that kinetically limited gas-particle partitioning may need to be considered when simulating secondary OA formation in the NCP.

Simulation of the chemical evolution of biomass burning organic aerosol,"The chemical transport model PMCAMx was extended to investigate the effects of partitioning and photochemical aging of biomass burning emissions on organic aerosol (OA) concentrations. A source-resolved version of the model, PMCAMx-SR, was developed in which biomass burning emissions and their oxidation products are represented separately from the other OA components. The volatility distribution and chemical aging of biomass burning OA (BBOA) were simulated based on recent laboratory measurements. PMCAMx-SR was applied to Europe during an early summer period (129 May 2008) and a winter period (25 February22 March 2009). During the early summer, the contribution of biomass burning (both primary and secondary species) to total OA levels over continental Europe was estimated to be approximately 16 %. During winter the contribution was nearly 47 %, due to both extensive residential wood combustion but also wildfires in Portugal and Spain. The intermediate volatility compounds (IVOCs) with effective saturation concentration values of 105 and 106 ?gm3 are predicted to contribute around one third of the BBOA during the summer and 15% during the winter by forming secondary OA (SOA). The uncertain emissions of these compounds and their SOA formation potential require additional attention. Evaluation of PMCAMx-SR predictions against aerosol mass spectrometer measurements in several sites around Europe suggests reasonably good performance for OA (fractional bias less than 35% and fractional error less than 50 %). The performance was weaker during the winter suggesting uncertainties in residential heating emissions and the simulation of the resulting BBOA in this season. Â© Author(s) 2019.",
Positive matrix factorization of organic aerosol: Insights from a chemical transport model,"Factor analysis of aerosol mass spectrometer measurements (organic aerosol mass spectra) is often used to determine the sources of organic aerosol (OA). In this study we aim to gain insights regarding the ability of positive matrix factorization (PMF) to identify and quantify the OA sources accurately. We performed PMF and multilinear engine (ME-2) analysis on the predictions of a state-of-the-art chemical transport model (PMCAMx-SR, Particulate Matter Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions - source resolved) during a photochemically active period for specific sites in Europe in an effort to interpret the diverse factors usually identified by PMF analysis of field measurements. Our analysis used the predicted concentrations of 27 OA components, assuming that each of them is ""chemically different"" from the others. The PMF results based on the chemical transport model predictions are quite consistent (same number of factors and source types) with those of the analysis of AMS measurements. The estimated uncertainty of the contribution of fresh biomass burning is less than 30% and of the other primary sources less than 40 %, when these sources contribute more than 20% to the total OA. The PMF uncertainty increases for smaller source contributions, reaching a factor of 2 or even 3 for sources which contribute less than 10% to the OA. One of the major questions in PMF analysis of AMS measurements concerns the sources of the two or more oxygenated OA (OOA) factors often reported in field studies. Our analysis suggests that these factors include secondary OA compounds from a variety of anthropogenic and biogenic sources and do not correspond to specific sources. Their characterization in the literature as low-and high-volatility factors is probably misleading, because they have overlapping volatility distributions. However, the average volatility of the one often characterized as a low-volatility factor is indeed lower than that of the other (high-volatility factor). Based on the analysis of the PMCAMx-SR predictions, the first oxygenated OA factor includes mainly highly aged OA transported from outside Europe, but also highly aged secondary OA from precursors emitted in Europe. The second oxygenated OA factor contains fresher secondary organic aerosol from volatile, semivolatile, and intermediate volatility anthropogenic and biogenic organic compounds. The exact contribution of these OA components to each OA factor depends on the site and the prevailing meteorology during the analysis period. Â© Author(s) 2019.",
Comparison of modeled and measured ice nucleating particle composition in a cirrus cloud,"The contribution of heterogeneous ice nucleation to the formation of cirrus cloud ice crystals is still not well quantified. This results in large uncertainties when predicting cirrus radiative effects and their role in Earth's climate system. The goal of this case study is to simulate the composition, and thus activation conditions, of ice nucleating particles (INPs) to evaluate their contribution to heterogeneous cirrus ice formation in relation to homogeneous ice nucleation. For this, the regional model COSMO-Aerosols and Reactive Trace Gases (COSMO-ART) was used to simulate a synoptic cirrus cloud over Texas on 13 April 2011. The simulated INP composition was then compared to measured ice residual particle (IRP) composition from the actual event obtained during the NASA Midlatitude Airborne Cirrus Properties Experiment (MACPEX) aircraft campaign. These IRP measurements indicated that the dominance of heterogeneous ice nucleation was mainly driven by mineral dust with contributions from a variety of other particle types. Applying realistic activation thresholds and concentrations of airborne transported mineral dust and biomass-burning particles, the model implementing the heterogeneous ice nucleation parameterization scheme of Ullrich et al. is able to reproduce the overall dominating ice formation mechanism in contrast to the model simulation with the scheme of Phillips et al. However, the model showed flaws in reproducing the IRP composition. Â© 2019 American Meteorological Society.",

Regional impact of biomass burning in southeast Asia on atmospheric aerosols during the 2013 seven South-East Asian studies project,"A nested air quality prediction modeling system (NAQPMS) with an online tracer-tagged module was utilized to investigate the regional impact of biomass burning (BB) on aerosols and sourceâ€“receptor relationships in Southeast Asia during Marchâ€“April 2013. NAQPMS could reproduce the three-dimensional spatial distribution of aerosols. Both monthly and episodic analyses indicated that BB significantly contributed to surface and column aerosol concentrations in Southeast Asia along two long-range transport pathways. In the first pathway, aerosols from BB were blown northward from the Indochina peninsula to southwestern provinces in China. The mean contributions of BB decreased from 70%â€“ 80% in the source regions to 10%â€“40% in southwestern China. Myanmar was the largest exporter. In the second pathway, PM2.5 emitted by BB was uplifted into the mid-altitudes (2000 m) in the Indochina peninsula and transported eastward to the western Pacific at altitudes of 2500â€“4000 m, passing the South China Sea, southern China and western Pacific. In downwind regions, BB contributed 30%â€“60% of aerosols at altitudes of 2000â€“4000 m and 10%â€“30% below 2000 m. A simple estimation based on sourceâ€“receptor relationships showed that BB emissions were likely overestimated by 35%â€“ 50% in the Fire Inventory from National Center for Atmospheric Research (v1.5).

Resolving anthropogenic aerosol pollution types - Deconvolution and exploratory classification of pollution events,"Mass spectrometric measurements commonly yield data on hundreds of variables over thousands of points in time. Refining and synthesizing this raw data into chemical information necessitates the use of advanced, statistics-based data analytical techniques. In the field of analytical aerosol chemistry, statistical, dimensionality reductive methods have become widespread in the last decade, yet comparable advanced chemometric techniques for data classification and identification remain marginal. Here we present an example of combining data dimensionality reduction (factorization) with exploratory classification (clustering), and show that the results cannot only reproduce and corroborate earlier findings, but also complement and broaden our current perspectives on aerosol chemical classification. We find that applying positive matrix factorization to extract spectral characteristics of the organic component of air pollution plumes, together with an unsupervised clustering algorithm, k-means+ + , for classification, reproduces classical organic aerosol speciation schemes. Applying appropriately chosen metrics for spectral dissimilarity along with optimized data weighting, the source-specific pollution characteristics can be statistically resolved even for spectrally very similar aerosol types, such as different combustion-related anthropogenic aerosol species and atmospheric aerosols with similar degree of oxidation. In addition to the typical oxidation level and source-driven aerosol classification, we were also able to classify and characterize outlier groups that would likely be disregarded in a more conventional analysis. Evaluating solution quality for the classification also provides means to assess the performance of mass spectral similarity metrics and optimize weighting for mass spectral variables. This facilitates algorithm-based evaluation of aerosol spectra, which may prove invaluable for future development of automatic methods for spectra identification and classification. Robust, statistics-based results and data visualizations also provide important clues to a human analyst on the existence and chemical interpretation of data structures. Applying these methods to a test set of data, aerosol mass spectrometric data of organic aerosol from a boreal forest site, yielded five to seven different recurring pollution types from various sources, including traffic, cooking, biomass burning and nearby sawmills. Additionally, three distinct, minor pollution types were discovered and identified as amine-dominated aerosols. Â© Author(s) 2017.",
Seasonal assessment and classification of aerosols transported to Lahore using AERONET and MODIS deep blue retrievals,"Daily measurements of aerosol optical depth (Ï„) and Ã…ngstrom wavelength exponent (Î±) acquired from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) are analysed over LahoreÂ â€“Â an urban city of Pakistan (period: 2010â€“2014) to investigate contribution of different types of aerosols originating from both local and regional source locations. The obtained annual averages (mean Â± standard deviation) for AERONET retrievals of Ï„ (500 nm) and Î± (440â€“870 nm) are 0.68 Â± 0.37 (0.08â€“2.91) and 0.99 Â± 0.33 (0â€“1.8), respectively. Of all the sources, 61% are found within Pakistan, 11% in India, 19% in Afghanistan, 6% in Iran and 2% in Saudi Arabia with seasonal contributions of 35, 25, 23 and 17% in pre-monsoon, monsoon, winter and post-monsoon, respectively. The bimodal distributions of Î± show dominance of coarse-mode particles during pre-monsoon, fine-mode particles during post-monsoon and presence of both coarse-mode and fine-mode particles during winter and monsoon with winter showing more fine-mode particles. Two broad classes of aerosols namely desert dust (DD) and biomass burning/urban industrial (BU) are identified with criteria, e.g. Ï„ â‰¥ 0.3 and Î± â‰¤ 0.75 indicating presence of DD while Ï„ â‰¥ 0.2 and Î± â‰¥ 1.15 indicating BU. The frequency of occurrence (FOO) of DD and BU aerosols is further identified by applying classification criteria over Aqua-MODIS deep blue retrievals. The FOO identifies anthropogenic activity on-going throughout the year, disrupted with DD aerosols only during pre-monsoon and monsoon. The maximum dust activity is seen over Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) (localized maxima: 35â€“45%) and the Arabian peninsula (>55%) during pre-monsoon, while maximum BU aerosols are found over IGP, central and south-eastern plains of India and the state of Gujarat (localized maxima: >70%) in winter and post-monsoon.

Classification of aerosol over central Europe by cluster analysis of aerosol columnar optical properties and backward trajectory statistics,"A cluster analysis is applied to the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data obtained at Belsk, Poland, as well as three nearby Central European stations (Leipzig, Minsk and Moldova) for estimation of atmospheric aerosol types. Absorption Ã…ngstrom exponent (AAE), aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and extinction Ã…ngstrom exponent (EAE) parameters are used. Clustering in both 2D (AOT, EAE) and 3D (AOT, EAE, AAE) is investigated. A method of air mass backward trajectory analysis is then proposed, with the receptor site at Belsk, to determine possible source regions for each cluster. Four dominant aerosol source regions are identified. The biomass burning aerosol source is localized in the vicinity of Belarusian-Ukrainian border. Slovakia and northern Hungary are found to be the source of urban/industrial pollutants. Western Poland and eastern Germany are the main sources of polluted continental aerosols. The most differentiated source region of Scandinavia, Baltic Sea and Northern Atlantic, associated with lowest values of AOT, corresponds to clean continental and possibly maritime type aerosols.

On the effect of live fuel moisture content on fire rate of spread,"Aim of study: To reconcile the effects of live fuel moisture content (FMC) on fire rate of spread (ROS) derived from laboratory and field fires. Methods: The analysis builds on evidence from previous fire-spread experimental studies and on a comparison between two functions for the FMC damping effect: one derived from field burns, based on dead FMC, and another derived from laboratory trials, based on a weighted FMC (dead and live fuels). Main results: In a typical Mediterranean shrubland, laboratory and field-derived FMC damping functions are linearly related, which is explained by the correlation between monthly average live and dead FMC variation throughout the year. This clarifies why the effect of live FMC on real-world fires ROS has remained elusive, although in fact it has an influence. Research highlights: By providing evidence that the most significant effect of FMC on ROS is independent of vegetation phenology (dead or live condition), and explaining why in specific situations dead FMC is sufficient to provide satisfactory ROS predictions, our results can assist future modelling efforts.

Ammonia emissions from biomass burning in the continental United States,"This study quantifies ammonia (NH3) emissions from biomass burning from 2005 to 2015 across the continental US (CONUS) and compares emissions from biomass burning with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Emissions Inventory (NEI), the Fire Inventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (FINN) and the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). A statistical regression model was developed in order to predict NH3 emissions from biomass burning using a combination of fire properties and meteorological data. Satellite data were used to evaluate the annual fire strength and frequency as well as to calculate the total NH3 emissions across the CONUS. The results of this study showed the total fire number has decreased, while the total yearly burn area and the average fire radiative power has increased. The average annual NH3 emissions from biomass burning from this study, on a national scale, were approximately 5.4e8 Â± 3.3e8 kg yearâˆ’1. When comparing the results of this study with other emission inventories, it was found that ammonia emissions estimated by the NEI were approximately a factor of 1.3 lower than what was calculated in this study and a factor of 1.1 lower than what was modeled using the statistical regression model for 2010â€“2014. The calculated NH3 emissions from biomass burning were a factor of 5.9 and a factor of 13.1 higher than the emissions from FINN and the GFED, respectively. The modeled NH3 emissions from biomass burning were a factor of 5.0 and a factor of 11.1 higher than the emissions from FINN and the GFED, respectively. As the climate continues to change, the pattern (frequency, intensity and magnitude) of fires across the US will also change, leading to changes in NH3 emissions. The statistical regression model developed in this study will allow prediction of NH3 emissions associated with climate change. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",
Understanding the Southeast Asian haze,"The Southeast Asian region had been subjected to a drastic reduction in air quality from the biomass burnings that occurred in 2013 and 2015. The smoke from the biomass burnings covered the entire region including Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, with haze particulate matter (PM) reducing the air quality to hazardous levels. Here we report a comprehensive size-composition-morphology characterization of the PM collected from an urban site in Singapore during the two haze events. The two haze events were a result of biomass burning and occurred in two different geographical source regions. We show the similarities and variations of particle size distribution during hazy and clear days during the two haze events. Sub-micron particles (<1 Î¼m) dominate (âˆ¼50%) the aerosols in the atmosphere during clear and hazy days. Using electron microscopy, we also categorize the PM, namely soot, organic-inorganic clusters and hybrid particles. The composition and morphology were similar in both the haze events. The majority of the PM is composed of carbon (âˆ¼51%) and other elements pertaining to the earth's crust. The complexity of the mixing state of the PM is highlighted and the role of the capture mode is addressed. We also present the morphological characterization of all the classified PM. The box counting method is used to determine the fractal dimensions of the PM, and the dimensionality varied for every classification from 1.79 to 1.88. We also report the complexities of particles and inconsistencies in the existing approaches to understand them. Â© 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.",
Chemical transport model simulations of organic aerosol in southern California: Model evaluation and gasoline and diesel source contributions,"Gasoline- and diesel-fueled engines are ubiquitous sources of air pollution in urban environments. They emit both primary particulate matter and precursor gases that react to form secondary particulate matter in the atmosphere. In this work, we updated the organic aerosol module and organic emissions inventory of a three-dimensional chemical transport model, the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ), using recent, experimentally derived inputs and parameterizations for mobile sources. The updated model included a revised volatile organic compound (VOC) speciation for mobile sources and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from unspeciated intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs). The updated model was used to simulate air quality in southern California during May and June 2010, when the California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) study was conducted. Compared to the Traditional version of CMAQ, which is commonly used for regulatory applications, the updated model did not significantly alter the predicted organic aerosol (OA) mass concentrations but did substantially improve predictions of OA sources and composition (e.g., POA-SOA split), as well as ambient IVOC concentrations. The updated model, despite substantial differences in emissions and chemistry, performed similar to a recently released research version of CMAQ (Woody et al., 2016) that did not include the updated VOC and IVOC emissions and SOA data. Mobile sources were predicted to contribute 30-40% of the OA in southern California (half of which was SOA), making mobile sources the single largest source contributor to OA in southern California. The remainder of the OA was attributed to non-mobile anthropogenic sources (e.g., cooking, biomass burning) with biogenic sources contributing to less than 5% to the total OA. Gasoline sources were predicted to contribute about 13 times more OA than diesel sources; this difference was driven by differences in SOA production. Model predictions highlighted the need to better constrain multi-generational oxidation reactions in chemical transport models.",

Detailed source-specific molecular composition of ambient aerosol organic matter using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry and 1H NMR,"Organic aerosols (OA) are universally regarded as an important component of the atmosphere that have far-ranging impacts on climate forcing and human health. Many of these impacts are related to OA molecular characteristics. Despite the acknowledged importance, current uncertainties related to the source apportionment of molecular properties and environmental impacts make it difficult to confidently predict the net impacts of OA. Here we evaluate the specific molecular compounds as well as bulk structural properties of total suspended particulates in ambient OA collected from key emission sources (marine, biomass burning, and urban) using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (UHR-MS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). UHR-MS and 1H NMR show that OA within each source is structurally diverse, and the molecular characteristics are described in detail. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that (1) aromatic nitrogen species are distinguishing components for these biomass burning aerosols; (2) these urban aerosols are distinguished by having formulas with high O/C ratios and lesser aromatic and condensed aromatic formulas; and (3) these marine aerosols are distinguished by lipid-like compounds of likely marine biological origin. This study provides a unique qualitative approach for enhancing the chemical characterization of OA necessary for molecular source apportionment. Â© 2016 by the authors.",
Characteristics and seasonal variation of carbonaceous and water soluble organic components in the aerosols over East India,"The present investigation intends to measurement of PM2.5 and PM10 samples from agricultural (AG) and an Adityapur industrial (AI) site of East India to better characterize the carbonecous and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC).

"Aerosol optical properties under the condition of heavy haze over an urban site of Beijing, China","In January 2013, several serious haze pollution events happened in North China. Cimel sunphotometer measurements at an urban site of Beijing (Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciencesâ€”CAMS) from 1 to 30 January 2013 were used to investigate the detailed variation of aerosol optical properties. It was found that Angstrom exponents were mostly larger than 0.80 when aerosol optical depth values are higher than 0.60 at the urban region of Beijing during January 2013. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) at the urban region of Beijing can remain steady at approximately 0.40 before haze happening and then increased sharply to more than 1.50 at 500Â nm with the onset of haze, which suggests that the fine-mode AOD is a factor of 20 of the coarse-mode AOD during a serious haze pollution event. The single scattering albedo was approximately 0.90 Â± 0.03 at 440, 675, 870 and 1,020Â nm during the haze pollution period. The single scattering albedo at 440Â nm as a function of the fine-mode fraction was relatively consistent, but it was highly variable at 675, 870 and 1,020Â nm. Except on January 12 and 18, all the fine-mode particle volumes were larger than those of coarse particles, which suggests that fine particles from anthropogenic activities made up most of the haze. Aerosol type classification analysis showed that the dominant aerosol types can be classified as both â€œmixedâ€ and â€œurban/industrial (U/I) and biomass burning (BB)â€ categories during the heavy haze period of Beijing in January of 2013. The mixed category occurrence was about 31Â %, while the U/I and BB was about 69Â %. Â© 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",
Source attribution of aerosol size distributions and model evaluation using Whistler Mountain measurements and GEOS-Chem-TOMAS simulations,"Remote and free-tropospheric aerosols represent a large fraction of the climatic influence of aerosols; however, aerosol in these regions is less characterized than those polluted boundary layers. We evaluate aerosol size distributions predicted by the GEOS-Chem-TOMAS global chemical transport model with online aerosol microphysics using measurements from the peak of Whistler Mountain, British Columbia, Canada (2182gmga.s.l., hereafter referred to as Whistler Peak). We evaluate the model for predictions of aerosol number, size, and composition during periods of free-tropospheric (FT) and boundary-layer (BL) influence at ""coarse"" 4&deg;g Ã— g5&deg; and ""nested"" 0.5&deg;g Ã— g0.667&deg; resolutions by developing simple FT/BL filtering techniques. We find that using temperature as a proxy for upslope flow (BL influence) improved the model-measurement comparisons. The best threshold temperature was around 2 &deg;C for the coarse simulations and around 6 &deg;C for the nested simulations, with temperatures warmer than the threshold indicating boundary-layer air. Additionally, the site was increasingly likely to be in cloud when the measured relative humidity (RH) was above 90g %, so we do not compare the modeled and measured size distributions during these periods. With the inclusion of these temperature and RH filtering techniques, the model-measurement comparisons improved significantly. The slope of the regression for N80 (the total number of particles with particle diameter, Dp, &gt; g80gnm) in the nested simulations increased from 0.09 to 0.65, R2 increased from 0.04 to 0.46, and log-mean bias improved from 0.95 to 0.07. We also perform simulations at the nested resolution without Asian anthropogenic emissions and without biomass-burning emissions to quantify the contribution of these sources to aerosols at Whistler Peak (through comparison with simulations with these emissions on). The long-range transport of Asian anthropogenic aerosol was found to be significant throughout all particle number concentrations, and increased N80 by more than 50g%, while decreasing the number of smaller particles because of suppression of new-particle formation and enhanced coagulation sink. Similarly, biomass burning influenced Whistler Peak during summer months, with an increase in N80 exceeding 5000gcm&minus;3. Occasionally, Whistler Peak experienced N80g &gt; g1000gcm&minus;3 without significant influence from Asian anthropogenic or biomass-burning aerosol. Air masses were advected at low elevations through forested valleys during times when temperature and downwelling insolation were high, ideal conditions for formation of large sources of low-volatility biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA). This condensable material increased particle growth and hence N80. The low-cost filtering techniques and source apportionment used in this study can be used in other global models to give insight into the sources and processes that shape the aerosol at mountain sites, leading to a better understanding of mountain meteorology and chemistry.

Identification of columnar aerosol types under high aerosol optical depth conditions for a single AERONET site in Korea,"Dominant aerosol types were classified using level 2 inversion products for the Anmyon Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site in Korea for the period 1999â€“2007. The aerosol types were mineral dust (MD), MD mixed with carbon, and black carbon mixed coarse particles (BCCP) for coarse mode aerosols, black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), and secondary inorganic ions (SII) for fine mode aerosols, and mixed particles between. The classification was carried out using a clustering method based on parameters, including single scattering albedo (SSA), absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE), and fine mode volume fraction (FMVF). Among the seven aerosol types, MD was distinct, with the highest AAE and a very low FMVF and SII with the highest SSA and FMVF. BCCP was introduced to designate coarse particles mixed with BC, of which the AAE was lower than 1, despite a low FMVF. In addition to a large difference in AAE between BC and OC, the SSA of OC was larger than that of BC, indicating the effects of the white smoke produced from the smoldering phase of biomass burning. Monthly variations of the aerosol types were well interpreted by meteorology and emissions and coincided with those in the previous studies. Applying our results to well-characterized global AERONET sites, we confirmed that the aerosol types at Anmyon were valid at other sites. However, the results also showed that the mean properties for aerosol types were influenced by the specific aerosols prevalent at the study sites. Â© 2016. American Geophysical Union.

"Aerosol chemical profile of near-source biomass burning smoke in sonla, vietnam during 7-SEAS campaigns in 2012 and 2013","This study aimed to investigate aerosol chemical characteristics and to obtain the chemical profile of near-source biomass burning (BB) aerosols at a site (675 m a.s.l.) in Sonla, Northern Vietnam. Particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 Î¼m (PM2.5) was collected over a 24 h sampling period as part of the Seven South East Asian Studies (7-SEAS) campaign. The studies were conducted when BB was highly active â€” that is, in the spring of 2012 and 2013. The collected particles were analyzed for carbonaceous fractions and water-soluble components, in addition to the mass concentration. Data obtained were further analyzed to determine the stable species profile by classifying the 5-day air-mass backward trajectories. The average PM2.5 mass concentrations were 51 Â± 19 Î¼g mâ€“3 and 57 Â± 27 Î¼g mâ€“3 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Carbonaceous contents dominated BB aerosol, with 59% Â± 9% and 58% Â± 9% in organic carbon (OC) and 9% Â± 3% and 10% Â± 3% in elemental carbon (EC) of PM2.5 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Of the 8 carbonaceous fractions analyzed thermo-optically for PM2.5, OC3 (evolution temperature at 280Â°Câ€“480Â°C) was most abundant in OC fractions, and EC1-OP (elemental carbon evolved at 580Â°C minus the pyrolized OC fractions) was predominant in EC fractions in most occasions. Among the measured water-soluble inorganic ions, NH4 + and SO4                             2- widely varied, indicating the influence of different trajectory origins. This finding was confirmed by trajectory classification of aerosol data. The trajectories were also distinguished with respect to char-EC to soot-EC ratio, and water-soluble OC. These characteristics were highest in the trajectory from the BB source area. Â© Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.",
