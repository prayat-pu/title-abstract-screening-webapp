AI-Driven Boost in Detection Accuracy for Agricultural Fire Monitoring,"In recent years, agricultural landscapes have increasingly suffered from severe fire incidents, posing significant threats to crop production, economic stability, and environmental sustainability. Timely and precise detection of fires, especially at their incipient stages, remains crucial to mitigate damage and prevent ecological degradation. However, conventional detection methods frequently fall short in accurately identifying small-scale fire outbreaks due to limitations in sensitivity and response speed. Addressing these challenges, this research proposes an advanced fire detection model based on a modified Detection Transformer (DETR) architecture. The proposed framework incorporates an optimized ConvNeXt backbone combined with a novel Feature Enhancement Block (FEB), specifically designed to refine spatial and contextual feature representation for improved detection performance. Extensive evaluations conducted on a carefully curated agricultural fire dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving precision, recall, mean Average Precision (mAP), and F1-score of 89.67%, 86.74%, 85.13%, and 92.43%, respectively, thereby surpassing existing state-of-the-art detection frameworks. These results validate the proposed architecture’s capability for reliable, real-time identification, offering substantial potential for enhancing agricultural resilience and sustainability through improved preventive strategies. © 2025 by the authors.",yes,Yes,No
AI-Driven UAV Surveillance for Agricultural Fire Safety,"The increasing frequency and severity of agricultural fires pose significant threats to food security, economic stability, and environmental sustainability. Traditional fire-detection methods, relying on satellite imagery and ground-based sensors, often suffer from delayed response times and high false-positive rates, limiting their effectiveness in mitigating fire-related damages. In this study, we propose an advanced deep learning-based fire-detection framework that integrates the Single-Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) with the computationally efficient MobileNetV2 architecture. This integration enhances real-time fire- and smoke-detection capabilities while maintaining a lightweight and deployable model suitable for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based agricultural monitoring. The proposed model was trained and evaluated on a custom dataset comprising diverse fire scenarios, including various environmental conditions and fire intensities. Comprehensive experiments and comparative analyses against state-of-the-art object-detection models, such as You Only Look Once (YOLO), Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), and SSD-based variants, demonstrated the superior performance of our model. The results indicate that our approach achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 97.7%, significantly surpassing conventional models while maintaining a detection speed of 45 frames per second (fps) and requiring only 5.0 GFLOPs of computational power. These characteristics make it particularly suitable for deployment in edge-computing environments, such as UAVs and remote agricultural monitoring systems. © 2025 by the authors.",yes,Yes,No
"Domain Adaptation and Fine-Tuning of a Deep Learning Segmentation Model of Small Agricultural Burn Area Detection Using High-Resolution Sentinel-2 Observations: A Case Study of Punjab, India","High-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery combined with a deep learning (DL) segmentation model offers a promising approach for accurate mapping of small and fragmented agricultural burn areas. Initially, the model was trained using ICNF burn area data from Portugal to capture large fire and burn area delineation, thereby achieving moderate accuracy. Subsequent fine-tuning using annotated data from Punjab improved the model’s ability to detect small burn patches, demonstrating higher accuracy than the baseline Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) Index method. On-ground validation using buffer zone analysis and crop field images confirmed the effectiveness of DL approach. Challenges such as cloud interference, temporal gaps in satellite data, and limited reference data for training persist, but this study underscores the methodogical advancements and potential of DL models applied for small burn area detection in agricultural settings. The model achieved overall accuracy of 98.7%, a macro-F1 score of 97.6%, IoU 0.54, and a Dice coefficient of 0.64, demonstrating its capability for detailed burn area delineation. The model can capture burn area smaller than 250 m2, but the model at present is less efficient at representing the full extent of the fires. Overall, outcomes demonstrate the model’s applicability to generalize to a new domain despite regional differences among research areas. © 2025 by the authors.",yes,No,Yes
Comparison of CNN and Vision Transformers for Wildfire Detection: A Proxy for Stubble Burning,"Stubble burning is a widely used agricultural practice in India and several other countries that greatly contribute to heavy air pollution. It is done to clear crop residues, usually from April to May and October to November. The gases released during this practice, including particulate matter and greenhouse gases, pose serious health and environmental risks [5]. This research focuses on classifying wildfire burning using satellite imagery as a proxy for stubble burning. We employ deep learning approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to analyze their accuracy, computational efficiency, and real time suitability for environmental monitoring and potentially reduce wildfire burning's impact on air quality.  © 2025 IEEE.",,No,No
Development and Application of Self-Supervised Machine Learning for Smoke Plume and Active Fire Identification from the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality Datasets,"Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) was a field campaign aimed at better understanding the impact of wildfires and agricultural fires on air quality and climate. The FIREX-AQ campaign took place in August 2019 and involved two aircraft and multiple coordinated satellite observations. This study applied and evaluated a self-supervised machine learning (ML) method for the active fire and smoke plume identification and tracking in the satellite and sub-orbital remote sensing datasets collected during the campaign. Our unique methodology combines remote sensing observations with different spatial and spectral resolutions. With as much as a 10% increase in agreement between our produced masks and high-certainty hand-labeled pixels, relative to evaluated operational products, the demonstrated approach successfully differentiates active fire pixels and smoke plumes from background imagery. This enables the generation of a per-instrument smoke and active fire mask product, as well as smoke and fire masks created from the fusion of selected data from independent instruments. This ML approach has the potential to enhance operational active wildfire monitoring systems and improve decision-making in air quality management through fast smoke plume identification and tracking and could improve climate impact studies through fusion data from independent instruments. © 2025 by the authors.",,No,No
MLSFDD: Machine-Learning-Based Smart Fire Detection Device for Precision Agriculture,"The agriculture sector contributes significantly to the overall development of the Indian economy. This sector can be revamped by modern technological interventions such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) along with traditional processes. To improve sustainable growth in the agriculture field, monitoring of parameters such as temperature, light, smoke, and flame is given top priority in crop yields. In this work, a smart IoT-based device [(ML-based smart fire detection device (MLSFDD)] is designed for smart agriculture. The proposed MLSFDD has gathered data from agricultural crop fields through sensors and sensed data are analyzed using state-of-the-art ML algorithms such as random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree (DT) to detect the fire status by sending the notification through Android phones during strange hours. This model has been realized and examined using raw data received from different sensors. The accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination ( R2 ), and ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) of the proposed model have been calculated via extensive simulation of four ML algorithms. The accuracy of the prediction model of 94% for DT, 93% for RF, 90% for SVR, and 92% for KNN has been achieved. This suggested that mapping the field area’s agricultural fire content can be accomplished using the DT ML model. The study’s findings provide a valuable resource for accurate fire prediction in precision agriculture. (Figure presented) © 2025 IEEE. All rights reserved.",,No,No
Harnessing deep learning for forecasting fire-burning locations and unveiling PM2.5 emissions,"Climate change and human activity have increased fires in India. Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) is released into the atmosphere by stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana and forest fires in the north-eastern and central areas of the country. Accurate short-term PM 2.5 estimates are essential to protect human health and reduce acute air pollution. However, global air quality forecasting methods grapple with a persistent assumption of fire emissions. They use near-real-time fire emissions throughout the prediction cycle. Air quality forecasts are prone to inaccuracies and biases due to fire emissions’ dynamic nature. We employ spatiotemporal deep learning techniques, specifically ConvLSTM and ConvGRU, to forecast fire emission locations up to three days in advance. Through our evaluation, we find that ConvLSTM outperforms ConvGRU in terms of prediction accuracy and performance. The chosen model provides a very good correlation coefficient (≈ 0.8) for the 1st day forecast and a moderate value (0.5 - 0.55) for subsequent 2nd and 3rd days forecasts. The predictors NDVI, temperature, wind, surface pressure, and total cloud cover are included to our model training to improve these correlations. In Punjab-Haryana, wind input improves results. This fire burning location prediction method could improve air quality forecasting. Our deep learning model can improve forecasts by revealing the complex interactions of components and reflecting fire emissions’ dynamic nature. This research may help improve air quality forecasts in the face of rising fire events, protecting communities across the Indian subcontinent. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,No,No
Fire monitoring and detection using brightness-temperature difference and water vapor emission from the atmospheric infrared sounder,"Radiance data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on board NASA's Aqua satellite provide an opportunity for fire detection. As wildfires play an increasingly great role in the environments of the United States West Coast, emergency teams face an ever-challenging task of mitigation and prediction. Furthermore, the increasing rate of wildfires in the American West Coast places an ever-increasing strain on ecosystems and global climate. Of particular interest is the ability to create effective near real-time (NRT) imaging and prediction. Advances in this field can play a crucial role in assisting wildfire detection and monitoring. Typical sources for satellite fire imaging study are the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instruments, but we present AIRS as complementary to these instruments with a new method of hotspot analysis. In this study, we propose a new method of fire detection by using AIRS's cloud-cleared radiance to detect hotspots and find new applications for this method of retrieval. We present the fire detection algorithm and initial assessments showing AIRS's ability to detect fires. In addition, we notice that there is more water vapor from the surface to the upper troposphere during the fire event as a result of biomass burning and an increase in air temperature. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No
Yolo-Based Technique for Stubble Burning Detection System Using Web App,"Stubble burning is the process of clearing rice crop remnants from the field in preparation for the next crop, wheat. Combine harvesters, as we all know, leave behind crop residue. Hence, stubble burning becomes crucial in areas where the ""combine harvesting"" technique is used since it has a negative environmental impact (it is a large source of air pollution and causes the soil to lose nutrients, which increases the need for fertilizer). Therefore, it is very important to put a stop to this practice. To keep a check on these burning, we are devising a stubble burning detection system. The burning or smoke will be detected using an imaging system to capture the data and report the appropriate information by backtracking the datasets. The machine learning model will be trained using an accurate dataset of wildfires, forest fires, and existing datasets on stubble burning. The problem would be solved using a highly efficient automated system that uses neural networks which would be built using and testing different ML models. The GPS location of the affected area will be provided to the concerned department, i.e., gram panchayat and local police station, through an app for further action. © 2024, Auricle Global Society of Education and Research.

Enhanced open biomass burning detection: The BranTNet approach using UAV aerial imagery and deep learning for environmental protection and health preservation,"Open biomass burning (OBB) in agriculture presents a significant and well-documented challenge, posing severe consequences for both environmental and human health. OBB releases air pollutants that degrade air quality and contribute to climate change, leading to premature deaths in regions with high concentrations of open crop straw burning (OCSB) emissions. Although policies aimed at prohibiting OBB are in place, the efficacy of these regulations in mitigating OCSB emissions remains ambiguous. Consequently, early prevention and monitoring of open biomass combustion are imperative for environmental preservation. Traditional monitoring techniques, reliant on fixed-position cameras, are constrained by their location and monitoring intensity, making concealed fire recognition a complex problem. To address this limitation and monitor the human living environment more flexibly and accurately, we propose a new method to identify straw fires in UAV Aerial Image Using CNN Branch Reinforce Transformer which named BranTNet, enabling early detection and rapid response to crop straw fires. By integrating computer vision technology and deep learning algorithms, straw fires in UAV-acquired aerial survey images can be detected and categorized. In the realm of artificial intelligence algorithms, we skillfully merge convolution and attention mechanisms, harnessing the full potential of both methodologies. Moreover, we seamlessly incorporate transfer learning, skillfully unifying self-training convolution modules with pre-trained transformer modules. This strategic amalgamation not only minimizes time costs but also ensures optimal experimental outcomes. Regarding data, we meticulously collected a substantial number of authentic samples, ensuring the sufficiency of our experimental dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits exceptional accuracy and robustness in detecting and identifying straw fires in UAV aerial survey images. Our approach outperforms the use of convolution or attention mechanisms alone. By integrating this approach with drone technology, we unlock the potential for developing more versatile and precise monitoring solutions, expanding the application of drones to diverse domains. This progress contributes significantly to the early detection and prevention of crop straw fires, fundamentally reducing environmental pollution, curbing carbon emissions, and advancing the cause of carbon neutrality. This innovative technique for monitoring and preventing OBB holds substantial promise in mitigating the adverse effects of OBB on the environment and human health. © 2023 The Author(s)",,No,No
Applicability of UAVs in detecting and monitoring burning residue of paddy crops with IoT Integration: A step towards greener environment,"The disposal of paddy-based residue in some parts of Indian north-western states, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, has emerged as a significant issue, leading farmers to resort to on-site burning. This practice wastes valuable resources, has detrimental effects on the local economy, and poses a global environmental challenge. The consequences of burning agricultural residues include soil erosion, carbon sequestration problems, and a negative impact on the ecosystem. Recognizing the importance of managing paddy residue due to its nutrient content and its contribution to soil–plant-atmosphere continuity, this article aims to quantify the amount of residue generated and shed light on the adverse effects of residue burning on human health, soil quality, and the environment in the region. Employing drone technology, the study presents an experimental case based on data collected from selected states in India. Real-time monitoring of agricultural land using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enables the acquisition of crucial data on paddy residue. The collected images are then transferred to the cloud for analysis and decision-making purposes. By leveraging this approach, the study achieves an accuracy of 96.67% in analysing paddy crop waste and identifying areas where residue burning occurs. The proposed work offers timely assistance to state authorities in pinpointing burning locations promptly, and taking necessary measures accordingly. This monitoring initiative not only contributes to climate control efforts but also aids in combating the rising AQI levels of air pollution, and potentially exploring other means of monitoring various environmental factors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No
An Investigation of Non-Spherical Smoke Particles Using CATS Lidar,"Smoke particles originating from biomass burning events are typically assumed to be spherical, yet non-spherical smoke particles are also reported from in situ observations. The spatial and temporal distributions of non-spherical smoke particles, which could have impacts on passive- and active-based satellite aerosol retrievals, are not yet well understood. In this analysis, using NASA's Cloud Aerosol Transport System (CATS) lidar data during the biomass burning season over Africa and South America from 2015 to 2017, we studied the frequency and distribution of non-spherical smoke particles. A supplemental smoke aerosol typing algorithm was developed to identify aerosol layers containing non-spherical smoke particles which could otherwise be misclassified as dust or dust mixture using the CATS standard aerosol typing algorithm. Approximately 30% of smoke layers over Africa and South America are non-spherical (depolarization ratio >0.1) and align with dry biomes of low soil moisture values. Conversely, spherical smoke layers (depolarization ratio <0.1) are in moist regions. The modified algorithm with improved discrimination of non-spherical smoke detection using CATS depolarization ratio was further verified with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model, Aerosol Robotic Network Ångström exponent retrievals, and National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis soil moisture data. This study highlights the limitations of current aerosol typing algorithms and the potential of algorithms employing ancillary data to improve aerosol typing such as multi-wavelength volume depolarization ratio measurements or synergy with passive sensors to further discriminate between aerosol types from spaceborne elastic backscatter lidar. © 2023.

Stubble Burning Detection and Prevention using Machine Learning and Blockchain,"Stubble burning in India contributes significantly to air pollution by emitting harmful gases and particles into the atmosphere. This annual practice is responsible for the severe pollution that envelops the country every winter, particularly in the National Capital Region. Lower temperatures and steadier air in winter exacerbate the impact of rice stubble burning. However, research on using machine learning with blockchain to address this problem is limited. This study aims to provide a conceptual framework for using machine learning and blockchain to prevent and detect stubble burning. With the help of machine learning and satellite images, areas originating the pollution can be identified. This can be done with pre-processed images sent to pre-trained models to identify the place of origin of the pollution. If the pollution crosses a threshold limit, then the location will be stored in the blockchain. A decentralized application will be created from where these details can be accessed by concerned authorities. © 2023 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.",,No,No
An AI-based Image Recognition System for Early Detection of Forest and Field Fires,"Forest fires and field fires (agricultural areas, grasslands, etc.) have severe global implications, causing significant environmental and economic harm. Traditional fire detection methods often rely on human personnel, which can pose safety risks and reduce their efficiency in large-scale monitoring. There is an urgent need for real-time fire detection technology to address these challenges and minimize losses. In this research, we propose the utilization of artificial intelligence techniques, specifically Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to tackle this issue. Our proposed system analyzes real-time images captured by IP cameras and stored on a cloud server. Its primary objective is to detect signs of fires and promptly notify users through a mobile application, ensuring timely awareness. We meticulously assembled a dataset to train our model by merging three existing datasets comprising both fire and non-fire images. Also, we incorporated images that could potentially be misinterpreted as fire, such as red trees, individuals wearing red clothing, and red flags. Furthermore, we supplemented the dataset with images of unaffected areas obtained from online sources. The final dataset consisted of 1,588 fire images and 909 non-fire images. During evaluations, our model achieved an accuracy of 93.07%. This enables effective detection, thus rapid intervention and damage reduction. It is a proactive and preventive solution to combat these devastating fires. © Copyright 2023 by Forest Engineering and Technologies Platform.",,No,No
Assessing predictability of post-monsoon crop residue fires in Northwestern India,"Over the past five decades, the Green Revolution in India has been a great success resulting in significantly increased crop yields and food grain productivity. Northwestern India, also known as the country’s breadbasket, alone produces two-thirds of the wheat and rice grains under the crop rotation system. Our previous study has shown that the post-monsoon rice crop production in the Punjab state of India has increased by 25%. The crop yields produce proportionate amounts of residue, a large part of which is subjected to burn in the open fields due to the near-absence of a wide-scale, affordable, and environmentally sustainable removal mechanism. A significant increase in crop productivity coincides with a 60% increase in post-harvest crop residue burning during 2002–2016. The study also demonstrated a robust relationship between satellite measurements of vegetation index—a proxy for crop amounts, and post-harvest fires—a precursor of air pollution events, for predicting seasonal agricultural burning. In this report, the efficacy of the proposed prediction model is assessed by comparing the forecasted seasonal fire activity against the actual detection of active fires for the post-monsoon burning seasons of 2017–2021. A simple linear regression model allows efficient prediction of seasonal fire activity within an error of up to 10%. In addition to forecasting seasonal fire activity, the linear regression model offers a practical tool to track and evaluate the effectiveness of the residue management system intended to reduce fire activities and resulting air pollution.

Stubble Burning Detection Using Multi-Sensor and Multi-Temporal Satellite Data,"Stubble burning is one of the major environmental hazards in almost all parts of the world. As agriculture became mechanized, combine harvesters leaves root-bound and scattered crop residues that are labor and cost intensive to remove, causing an increase in the recorded cases for burning of residues. The problem of stubble burning is more intense in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of India due to highly mechanized farming practices, which leaves a huge amount of stubble in the field particularly after the harvest of rice. Traditionally, farmers collect crop residue to feed livestock manually. In this stubble burning study we explore the potential of the MODIS ""MCD14DL-NRT""(Active Fire Data) product at a spatial resolution of 1000m available since November 2000, for the identification of fire prone areas in India. This study highlights the count of fire occurrences recorded from the MODIS Active Fire Data over a period of more than 20 years. During the months of October and November, which coincide with the paddy harvest season in the area an abrupt increase in fire activity is observed. The period of paddy harvesting, coupled with the onset of the winter season in the northern part of the country makes the region highly polluted and a breeding ground for numerous health problems for the citizens. In our study, we found that the state of Punjab records the majority of fires in India during this time period. © 2023 IEEE.",,No,No
Forecasting Crop Residue Fires in Northeastern China Using Machine Learning,"With repeated changes to local crop residue disposal policies in recent years, the distribution and density of crop residue fire events have been irregular in both space and time. A nonlinear and complex relationship between natural and anthropogenic factors often affects the occurrence of crop residue field fires. To overcome this difficulty, we used the Himawari-8 wildfire data for 2018–2021 to verify the likelihood of crop residue fires against the results of three machine learning methods: logistic regression, backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and decision tree (DT). The results showed the verified accuracies of BPNN and DT methods were 68.59 and 79.59%. Meantime, the sensitivity and specificity of DT performed the best, with the value of area under the curve (AUC) 0.82. Furthermore, among all the influencing factors, open burning prohibition constraints, relative humidity and air pressure showed significant correlations with open burning events. As such, BPNN and DT could accurately forecast the occurrence of agricultural fires. The results presented here may improve the ability to forecast agricultural field fires and provide important advances in understanding fire formation in Northeastern China. They would also provide scientific and technical support for crop fire control and air quality forecasting. © 2022 by the authors.",,No,No
Open Agricultural Burning Detection with Natural Inspired Swarm-based Detection Platform,"Agriculture often plays a big part in economic growth in most countries such as India, Indonesia, Thailand as well as Malaysia. Countries such as Thailand and Indonesia contribute a large volume of rice imports and export, however, in Indonesia, this major rice production comes with a large setback. Agriculture practices in Indonesia utilize open burning to process by-products of harvested rice fields to process it into bio-fertilizers which later fertilize the crop field. This is a problem as open burning on large scale causes major haze storms which spreads from Indonesia to the majority of parts of Malaysia annually. The composition of haze which includes carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide is hazardous to the human body when inhaled, they also contribute to the cause of air pollution. To reduces the severity of illegal open burning, we must first understand the overall characteristic of the smoke plume before introducing detection methods. Platforms such as drones and gliders with olfaction sensors can detect the plume thus locating the fire source. With the introduction of Swarm intelligence (SI), a drone detection platform can be deployed at large volumes to cover larger areas while localizing fire sources in a much more efficient fashion. Thus, this paper provides a review of swarm intelligence with the collaboration of sensors in optimizing plume dispersion problems and suggestions for future research ideas in collaborating detection platforms and SI. Open Burning has been a decade-long issue that the world trying to tackle when it comes to climate change. In Southeast Asia countries often, left-over crops are burnt openly, and the by-product of these open burning are utilized as bio-fertilizers which nourishes the crop fields. This has not only addressed the source of global warming but contributes to annual haze storm that affects countries like Malaysia and Thailand severely. To reduce the severity of open burning problems, we must first tackle the source of the problem, thus detecting the smoke plume emitted by these open burning can be the key to shutting down the possibility of open burning. However, detecting a smoke plume can be challenging as it is a dynamic problem that changes over time with external influences. Introducing Swarm Intelligence (SI) into the drone platform can reduce the time taken to localize the source of these open burning, and thus distinguishing these fire sources can minimize the impact of already ongoing open burning.  © 2022 IEEE.",,No,No
Smoke detection from himawari-8 satellite data over kalimantan island using multilayer perceptrons,"The smoke from biomass burning on Kalimantan Island has caused severe environmental problems in Southeast Asia’s primary burning regions and surrounding regions due to the overspread haze. To monitor the biomass burning aerosol plumes on Kalimantan Island, the high-temporal-resolution Himawari-8 satellite data were used in this study. However, studies are limited on smoke detection using satellite remote sensing for Kalimantan Island because of the difficulty caused by frequently occurring clouds and the lack of prior knowledge on applying traditional threshold methods. In this study, we used the multilayer perceptron (MLP) method to identify smoke over Kalimantan Island in August 2015, one of the most severe fire seasons. To prepare sufficient supervision information, a pixel-level labeled dataset was established based on the Himawari-8 data. Based on the labeled dataset, three MLP approaches and two sampling methods were applied to create training samples. A comparison between the detection results for the MLP approaches and classification tree analysis (i.e., CTA) showed that MLP is superior to CTA. The visualization results also showed that the detected smoke areas included those mixed with clouds. Some detected smoke is difficult to identify by the human eye, suggesting that the explanatory dataset built for this study is sufficiently comprehensive. Therefore, the pixel-level labeled dataset and MLP are suitable for regions that are frequently cloud-covered. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,No,No
A Global Bottom-Up Approach to Estimate Fuel Consumed by Fires Using Above Ground Biomass Observations,"Real-time estimates of the fuel consumed during a fire (dry-matter) relies on indirect estimate from remotely sensed released energy combined with biome dependent conversion coefficients. The uncertainties in the conversions lead to the use of inflation factors to avoid large underestimations in the prediction of aerosol load during fires. In this study, adopting two different fire inventories for burned areas, we apply above ground biomass (AGB) observations [from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L-band vegetation optical depth] as proxy for fuel load in deriving estimates of dry-matter. These new estimates are then converted into biomass burning aerosols and validated against independent aerosol optical depth observations from the AERONET in situ global network. Results showed that use of AGB as a proxy observation of fuel load improves fire emission estimates and substituting the need for indirect dry-matter estimates from remotely sensed fire activity or for the use of inflation factors. © 2021.

Can neural networks forecast open field burning of crop residue in regions with anthropogenic management and control? A case study in northeastern China,"Open burning is often used to remove crop residue during the harvest season. Despite a series of regulations by the Chinese government, the open burning of crop residue still frequently occurs in China, and the monitoring and forecasting crop fires have become a topic of active research. In this paper, crop fires in Northeastern China were forecasted using an artificial neural network (ANN) based on moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite fire data from 2013–2020. Both natural factors (meteorological, soil moisture content, harvest date) and anthropogenic factors were considered. The model’s forecasting accuracy under natural factors reached 77.01% during 2013–2017. When considering the influence of anthropogenic management and control policies, such as the straw open burning prohibition areas in Jilin Province, the accuracy of the forecast results for 2020 was reduced to 60%. Although the forecasting accuracy was lower than for natural factors, the relative error between the observed fire points and the back propagation neural network (BPNN) forecasting results was acceptable. In terms of influencing factors, air pressure, the change in soil moisture content in a 24h period and the daily soil moisture content were significantly correlated with open burning. The results of this study improve our ability to forecast agricultural fires and provide a scientific framework for regional prevention and control of crop residue burning. © 2021 by the authors.

Applications of artificial intelligence in fire safety of agricultural structures,"Artificial intelligence applications in fire safety of agricultural structures have practical economic and technological benefits on commercial agriculture. The FAO estimates that wildfires result in at least USD 1 billion in agriculture-related losses due to the destruction of livestock pasture, destruction of agricultural buildings, premature death of farm animals, and general disruption of agricultural activities. Even though artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and adaptive neurofuzzy inference systems (AN-FISs), among others, have proven useful in fire prevention, their application is limited in real farm environments. Most farms rely on traditional/non-technology-based methods of fire prevention. The case for AI in agricultural fire prevention is grounded on the accuracy and reliability of computer simulations in smoke movement analysis, risk assessment, and postfire analysis. In addition, such technologies can be coupled with next-generation fire-retardant materials such as intumescent coatings with a polymer binder, blowing agent, carbon donor, and acid donor. Future prospects for AI in agriculture transcend basic fire safety to encompass Society 5.0, energy systems in smart cities, UAV monitoring, Agriculture 4.0, and decentralized energy. However, critical challenges must be overcome, including the health and safety aspects, cost, and reliability. In brief, AI offers un-limited potential in the prevention of fire hazards in farms, but the existing body of knowledge is inadequate. © 2021 by the authors.

"Exploring prisma scene for fire detection: Case study of 2019 bushfires in ben halls gap national park, nsw, australia","Precursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (Hyperspectral Precursor of the Application Mission, PRISMA) is a new hyperspectral mission by the ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, Italian Space Agency) mission launched in 2019 to measure the unique spectral features of diverse materials including vegetation and forest disturbances. In this study, we explored the potential use of this new sensor PRISMA for active wildfire characterization. We used the PRISMA hypercube acquired during the Australian bushfires of 2019 in New South Wales to test three detection techniques that take advantage of the unique spectral features of biomass burning in the spectral range measured by PRISMA. The three methods—the CO2-CIBR (continuum interpolated band ratio), HFDI (hyperspec-tral fire detection index) and AKBD (advanced K band difference)—were adapted to the PRISMA sensor’s characteristics and evaluated in terms of performance. Classification techniques based on machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, SVM) were used in combination with the visual interpretation of a panchromatic sharpened PRISMA image for validation. Preliminary analysis showed a good overall performance of the instrument in terms of radiance. We observed that the presence of the striping effect in the data can influence the performance of the indices. Both the CIBR and HFDI adapted for PRISMA were able to produce a detection rate spanning between 0.13561 and 0.81598 for CO2-CIBR and that between 0.36171 and 0.88431 depending on the chosen band combination. The potassium emission index turned out to be inadequate for locating flaming in our data, possibly due to multiple factors such as striping noise and the spectral resolution (12 nm) of the PRISMA band centered at the potassium emission. © 2021 by the authors.

A classification scheme to determine wildfires from the satellite record in the cool grasslands of southern Canada: Considerations for fire occurrence modelling and warning criteria,"Daily polar-orbiting satellite MODIS thermal detections since 2002 were used as the baseline for quantifying wildfire activity in the mixed grass and agricultural lands of southernmost central Canada. This satellite thermal detection record includes both the responsible use of fire (e.g. for clearing crop residues, grassland ecosystem management, and traditional burning) and wildfires in grasslands and agricultural lands that pose a risk to communities and other values. A database of known wildfire evacuations and fires otherwise requiring suppression assistance from provincial forest fire agencies was used to train a model that classified satellite fire detections based on weather, seasonality, and other environmental conditions. A separate dataset of high resolution (Landsat 8 thermal anomalies) of responsible agricultural fire use (e.g. crop residue burning) was collected and used to train the classification model to the converse. Key common attributes of wildfires in the region included occurrence on or before the first week of May with high rates of grass curing, wind speeds over 30 km h-1, relative humidity values typically below 40 %, and fires that are detected in the mid-afternoon or evening.

In this study, we explored the potential use of this new sensor PRISMA for active wildfire characterization. We used the PRISMA hypercube acquired during the Australian bushfires of 2019 in New South Wales to test three detection techniques that take advantage of the unique spectral features of biomass burning in the spectral range measured by PRISMA. The three methods—the CO2-CIBR (continuum interpolated band ratio), HFDI (hyperspec-tral fire detection index) and AKBD (advanced K band difference)—were adapted to the PRISMA sensor’s characteristics and evaluated in terms of performance. Classification techniques based on machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, SVM) were used in combination with the visual interpretation of a panchromatic sharpened PRISMA image for validation. Preliminary analysis showed a good overall performance of the instrument in terms of radiance. We observed that the presence of the striping effect in the data can influence the performance of the indices. Both the CIBR and HFDI adapted for PRISMA were able to produce a detection rate spanning between 0.13561 and 0.81598 for CO2-CIBR and that between 0.36171 and 0.88431 depending on the chosen band combination. The potassium emission index turned out to be inadequate for locating flaming in our data, possibly due to multiple factors such as striping noise and the spectral resolution (12 nm) of the PRISMA band centered at the potassium emission. © 2021 by the authors.

Insurance Fraud Identification using Computer Vision and IoT: A Study of Field Fires,"Insurance fraud detection has always been manual labor relegated to claim agents, who examine the facts and reach on an intuition-based conclusion. The following article proposes an automated solution to regulate the process of fraud detection of field fire-based insurance claims in the agricultural sector. The proposed work is an amalgam of computer vision, deep learning, and Internet of Things and aims to inculcate the positives of each of these technologies. To the best of our knowledge, a combination of the said technologies has never been used for insurance fraud analyses in the field of agriculture, making this a novel approach. The proposed model actively reads the input from the IR and temperature sensors of the IoT device, which further collects images of the field once the sensor values cross their respective thresholds. The collected images are then fed into a fire detection model trained using a variety of classifiers for performance comparisons. The results display that the proposed solution has an accuracy of 97%, which can be further increased with a refined dataset dedicated solely to fraud detection. © 2020 The Authors.

Long-Lead Prediction of the 2015 Fire and Haze Episode in Indonesia,"We conducted a case study of National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System version 2 seasonal model forecast performance over Indonesia in predicting the dry conditions in 2015 that led to severe fire, in comparison to the non-El Niño dry season conditions of 2016. Forecasts of the Drought Code (DC) component of Indonesia's Fire Danger Rating System were examined across the entire equatorial Asia region and for the primary burning regions within it. Our results show that early warning lead times of high observed DC in September and October 2015 varied considerably for different regions. High DC over Southern Kalimantan and Southern New Guinea were predicted with 180 day lead times, whereas Southern Sumatra had lead times of up to only 60 days, which we attribute to the absence in the forecasts of an eastward decrease in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures. This case study provides the starting point for longer-term evaluation of seasonal fire danger rating forecasts over Indonesia. ©2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",,No,No
Active fire detection using Landsat-8/OLI data,"The gradual increase in Landsat-class data availability creates new opportunities for fire science and management applications that require higher-fidelity information about biomass burning, improving upon existing coarser spatial resolution (≥ 1 km) satellite active fire data sets. Targeting those enhanced capabilities we describe an active fire detection algorithm for use with Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) daytime and nighttime data. The approach builds on the fire-sensitive short-wave infrared channel 7 complemented by visible and near-infrared channel 1–6 data (daytime only), while also expanding on the use of multi-temporal analysis to improve pixel classification results. Despite frequent saturation of OLI's fire-affected pixels, which includes radiometric artifacts resulting from folding of digital numbers, our initial assessment based on visual image analysis indicated high algorithm fidelity across a wide range of biomass burning scenarios, gas flares and active volcanoes. Additional field data verification confirmed the sensor's and algorithm's ability to resolve fires of significantly small areas compared to current operational satellite fire products. Commission errors were greatly reduced with the addition of multi-temporal analysis tests applied to co-located pixels, averaging less than 0.2% globally. Because of its overall quality, Landsat-8/OLI active fire data could become part of a network of emerging earth observation systems providing enhanced spatial and temporal coverage of biomass burning at global scales. © 2015 The Authors",,No,No
Introducing a smoke prediction tool for small scale agricultural burn management,"The adverse health effects of sugarcane burning emissions on surrounding communities are well documented. The state of Louisiana is the second largest producer of sugarcane in the US, but mitigation of burn emissions remains voluntary. Sugarcane farmers in Louisiana attempt to mitigate the effects of burn emission by estimating the characteristics of the resultant smoke plume using meteorological variables as rough parameters. The current mitigation method is a manual process requiring the tedious look-up of atmospheric variables from multiple sources and physically drawing a predicted smoke plume on a paper map, leaving room for human error. We present the development and initial assessment of the adoptability of a new online burn emission application developed to replace the manual mitigation process. © 2016, University of North Carolina Press.

Development and demonstration of a Lagrangian dispersion modeling system for real-time prediction of smoke haze pollution frombiomass burning in Southeast Asia,"Transboundary smoke haze caused by biomass burning frequently causes extreme air pollution episodes in maritime and continental Southeast Asia. With millions of people being affected by this type of pollution every year, the task to introduce smoke haze related air quality forecasts is urgent. We investigate three severe haze episodes: June 2013 in Maritime SE Asia, induced by fires in central Sumatra, and March/April 2013 and 2014 on mainland SE Asia. Based on comparisons with surface measurements of PM10 we demonstrate that the combination of the Lagrangian dispersion model NAME with emissions derived from satellite-based active-fire detection provides reliable forecasts for the region. Contrasting two fire emission inventories shows that using algorithms to account for fire pixel obscuration by cloud or haze better captures the temporal variations and observed persistence of local pollution levels. Including up-to-date representations of fuel types in the area and using better conversion and emission factors is found to more accurately represent local concentration magnitudes, particularly for peat fires. With both emission inventories the overall spatial and temporal evolution of the haze events is captured qualitatively, with some error attributed to the resolution of the meteorological data driving the dispersion process. In order to arrive at a quantitative agreement with local PM10 levels, the simulation results need to be scaled. Considering the requirements of operational forecasts, we introduce a real-time bias correction technique to the modeling system to address systematic and random modeling errors, which successfully improves the results in terms of reduced normalized mean biases and fractional gross errors. © 2015.

"Climate, landowner residency, and land cover predict local scale fire activity in the Western Amazon","The incidence of escaped agricultural fire has recently been increasing in the Western Amazon, driven by climate variability, land use change, and changes in patterns of residency and land occupation. Preventing and mitigating the negative impacts of fire in the Amazon require a comprehensive understanding not only of what the drivers of fire activity are, but also how these drivers interact and vary across scales. Here, we combine multi-scalar data on land use, climate, and landowner residency to disentangle the drivers of fire activity over 10 years (2001-2010) on individual landholdings in a fire-prone region of the Peruvian Amazon. We examined the relative importance of and interactions between climate variability (drought intensity), land occupation (in particular, landowner absenteeism), and land cover variables (cover of fallow and pasture) for predicting both fire occurrence (whether or not fire was detected on a farm in a given year) and fire size. Drought intensity was the most important predictor of fire occurrence, but land-cover type and degree of landowner absenteeism increased fire probability when conditions were dry enough. On the other hand, drought intensity did not stand out relative to other significant predictors in the fire size model, where degree of landowner absenteeism in a village and percent cover of fallow in a village were also strongly associated with fire size. We also investigated to what extent these variables measured at the individual landholding versus the village scale influenced fire activity. While the predictors measured at the landholding and village scales were approximately of equal importance for modeling fire occurrence, only village scale predictors were important in the model of fire size. These results demonstrate that the relative importance of various drivers of fire activity can vary depending on the scale at which they are measured and the scale of analysis. Additionally, we highlight how a full understanding of the drivers of fire activity should go beyond fire occurrence to consider other metrics of fire activity such as fire size, as implications for fire prevention and mitigation can be different depending on the model considered. Drought early warning systems may be most effective for preventing fire in dry years, but management to address the impacts of landowner absenteeism, such as bolstering community fire control efforts in high-risk areas, could help minimize the size of fires when they do occur. Thus, interventions should focus on minimizing fire size as well as preventing fires altogether, especially because fire is an inexpensive and effective management tool that has been in use for millennia. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,No,No
Near-source dispersion and coagulation parameterization: Application to biomass burning emissions,"Aerosol size distributions near biomass-burning sources undergo rapid evolution, primarily due to coagulation, which significantly alters the particle number size distribution. Existing long-range aerosol transport and climate prediction models often overlook near-source dynamics involving simultaneous coagulation and dispersion. To bridge this gap, the present study introduces a coagulation-dispersion model and provides semi-analytical solutions for the effective size distribution parameters. The precise solution for a diffusion-less coagulating plume with spatially varying particle concentration supports the conceptual accuracy of the semi-analytical parameterization for dispersion-coagulation model. These solutions form the basis for a parameterization scheme that considers input parameters such as source dimensions, particle mass flux, particle size, and atmospheric conditions. Utilizing this parameterization for case-specific biomass burning emissions shows a decrease in number emission rate by approximately a factor of 600, while the count median diameter of the initial size distribution increases by around 7 times. Additionally, we estimate the optical properties of aerosols both before and after the introduction of the near-source parameterization scheme. Results indicate an increase by a factor of 4 in the aerosol extinction coefficient and by a factor of ∼20 in the scattering coefficient, which will significantly influence the calculation of aerosol optical properties in global models. These changes in optical properties primarily stem from modifications in aerosol size distribution resulting from near-source aerosol dynamics. The results are further discussed. © 2024 The Authors",,No,No
A fuzzy machine learning approach for identification of paddy stubble burnt fields,"Stubble burning is the most common practice in Northern region of India and is considered as the main reason for pollution in nearby NCR (National Capital Region) New Delhi, India. Therefore, in this research work, paddy stubble burnt fields were identified by using fuzzy based machine learning algorithms for a test site in Patiala, Punjab, India. An Euclidean Distance (ED) and Gaussian Kernel based Modified Possibilistic c-Means (MPCM) algorithms were used for this purpose. The main objective of this research work was to test the effectiveness of machine learning approach for identification of paddy stubble burnt filed and also to find out the better classifier amongst Euclidean Distance (ED) and Gaussian Kernel MPCM classifier. The Sentinel 2A/2B cloud free temporal data having a high frequency of repetitiveness in the interval of 5-days were used. To reduce spectral dimensionality of data Class Based Sensor Independent Indices (CBSII) database were generated. The burning was mainly observed from the last week of October to the first week of November and has been visualized using variation of CBSII-NDVI temporal plot. Normalized Burnt Ratio (NBR) was computed and compared with CBSII-NDVI outputs for both the ED and Kernel based MPCM classifiers. Delta Normalized Burnt Ratio (ΔNBR) was computed for cross-validation of burnt patches and is found to be in between 0.45 and 0.66. Thus, it can be concluded that kernel based MPCM classifiers are more efficient in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise in comparison to distance based MPCM classifiers, for the mapping of paddy burnt fields. © 2020, Korean Spatial Information Society.",,No,No
Analysis fire patterns and drivers with a global SEVER-FIRE v1.0 model incorporated into dynamic global vegetation model and satellite and on-ground observations,"                             Biomass burning is an important environmental process with a strong influence on vegetation and on the atmospheric composition. It competes with microbes and herbivores to convert biomass to CO                             2                              and it is a major contributor of gases and aerosols to the atmosphere. To better understand and predict global fire occurrence, fire models have been developed and coupled to dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and Earth system models (ESMs). We present SEVER-FIRE v1.0 (Socio-Economic and natural Vegetation ExpeRimental global fire model version 1.0), which is incorporated into the SEVER DGVM. One of the major focuses of SEVER-FIRE is an implementation of pyrogenic behavior of humans (timing of their activities and their willingness and necessity to ignite or suppress fire), related to socioeconomic and demographic conditions in a geographical domain of the model application. Burned areas and emissions from the SEVER model are compared to the Global Fire Emission Database version 2 (GFED), derived from satellite observations, while number of fires is compared with regional historical fire statistics. We focus on both the model output accuracy and its assumptions regarding fire drivers and perform (1) an evaluation of the predicted spatial and temporal patterns, focusing on fire incidence, seasonality and interannual variability; (2) analysis to evaluate the assumptions concerning the etiology, or causation, of fire, including climatic and anthropogenic drivers, as well as the type and amount of vegetation. SEVER reproduces the main features of climate-driven interannual fire variability at a regional scale, for example the large fires associated with the 1997-1998 El Niño event in Indonesia and Central and South America, which had critical ecological and atmospheric impacts. Spatial and seasonal patterns of fire incidence reveal some model inaccuracies, and we discuss the implications of the distribution of vegetation types inferred by the DGVM and of assumed proxies of human fire practices. We further suggest possible development directions to enable such models to better project future fire activity.                          © 2019 Author(s).",,No,No
Human-ignited wildfire patterns and responses to policy shifts,"Development of efficient forest wildfire policies requires an understanding of the underlying reasons behind forest fire occurrences. Globally, there is a close relationship between forest wildfires and human activities; most wildfires are human events due to negligence (e.g., agricultural burning escapes) and deliberate actions (e.g., vandalism, pyromania, revenge, land use change attempts). We model the risk of wildfire as a function of the spatial pattern of urban development and the abandonment/intensity of agricultural and forestry activities, while controlling for biophysical and climatic factors. We use a count data approach to model deliberately set fires in Galicia, N.W. Spain, where wildfire is a significant threat to forest ecosystems, with nearly 100,000 wildfires recorded during a thirteen-year period (1999-2011). The spatial units of analysis are more than 3600 parishes. Data for the human influences are derived from fine-resolution maps of wildland-urban interface (WUI), housing spatial arrangements, road density, forest ownership, and vegetation type. We found wildfire risk to be higher where there are human populations and development/urbanisation pressure, as well as in unattended forest areas due to both rural exodus and a fragmented forest ownership structure that complicates the profitability of forestry practices. To better help direct management efforts, parameter estimates from our model were used to predict wildfire counts under alternative scenarios that account for variation across space on future land-use conditions. Policies that incentivize cooperative forest management and that constrain urban development in wildlands at hotspot fire locations are shown to reduce wildfire risk. Our results highlight the need for spatially targeted fire management strategies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,No,No
Future projections of Siberian wildfire and aerosol emissions,"Wildfires are among the most influential disturbances affecting ecosystem structure and biogeochemical cycles in Siberia. Therefore, accurate fire modeling via dynamic global vegetation models is important for predicting greenhouse gas emissions and other biomass-burning emissions to understand changes in biogeochemical cycles. We integrated the widely used SPread and InTensity of FIRE (SPITFIRE) fire module into the spatially explicit individual-based dynamic global vegetation model (SEIB-DGVM) to improve the accuracy of fire predictions and then simulated future fire regimes to better understand their impacts. The model can reproduce the spatiotemporal variation in biomass, fire intensity, and fire-related emissions well compared to the recent satellite-based estimations: aboveground biomass (R2 = 0.847, RMSE =18.3 Mg ha−1), burned fraction (R2 = 0.75, RMSE= 0.01), burned area (R2 = 0.609, RMSE = 690 ha), dry-matter emissions (R2 = 0.624, RMSE = 0.01 kg DM m−2; dry matter), and CO2 emissions (R2 = 0.705, RMSE = 6.79 Tg). We then predicted that all of the 33 fire-related gas and aerosol emissions would increase in the future due to the enhanced amount of litter as fuel load from increasing forest biomass production under climate forcing of four Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP8.5, RCP6.0, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6. The simulation under RCP8.5 showed that the CO2, CO, PM2.5, total particulate matter (TPM), and total particulate carbon (TPC) emissions in Siberia in the present period (2000–2020) will increase relatively by 189.66±6.55, 15.18±0.52, 2.47±0.09, 1.87±0.06, and 1.30±0.04 Tg species yr−1, respectively, in the future period (2081–2100) and the number of burned trees will increase by 100 %, resulting in a 385.19 ± 40.4 g C m−2 yr−1 loss of net primary production (NPP). Another key finding is that the higher litter moisture by higher precipitation would relatively suppress the increment of fire-related emissions; thus the simulation under RCP8.5 showed the lowest emissions among RCPs. Our study offers insights into future fire regimes and development strategies for enhancing regional resilience and for mitigating the broader environmental consequences of fire activity in Siberia. © Author(s) 2024.",,No,No
