Spatiotemporal Analysis and Anomalous Trends of Asia AOD (2001–2024): Insights from a Deep Learning Fusion Model and EOF Decomposition,"Long-term investigations of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) across Asia are crucial for understanding its regional impacts on the global climate system. However, satellite-derived AOD datasets frequently suffer from missing values due to factors such as cloud cover, algorithmic limitations, and various atmospheric conditions. To overcome these challenges, this study employs the deep learning model TabNet, incorporating Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data and ERA5 meteorological variables, to fuse MERRA-2 AOD with MODIS MAIAC AOD observations. The resulting integration yields a high-resolution, seamless daily AOD dataset for Asia spanning the period from 2001 to 2024. The fused dataset demonstrates significant improvements over the original MERRA-2 AOD, with an increase in the coefficient of determination (R2) by 0.1065 and a reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.0369. Spatio-temporal analysis, conducted using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) decomposition, reveals that AOD concentrations across Asia are strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors, including industrial activities, transportation emissions, and biomass burning. The results indicate a generally increasing trend in AOD from 2001 to 2014, followed by a declining trend from 2015 to 2024. Notably, EOF results show a marked rise in AOD levels in Mongolia after 2020, likely attributable to an uptick in dust storm activity. This research offers valuable insights into the spatiotemporal trends of aerosols across Asia, underscoring the need for sustained air quality measures to mitigate pollution and protect public health. © 2025 by the authors.",no,No,No,No
Urban Air Quality Shifts in China: Application of Additive Model and Transfer Learning to Major Cities,"The impact of reduced human activity on air quality in seven major Chinese cities was investigated by utilizing datasets of air pollutants and meteorological conditions from 2016 to 2021. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was developed to predict air quality during reduced-activity periods and rigorously validated against ground station measurements, achieving an R2 of 0.85–0.93. Predictions were compared to the observed pollutant reductions (e.g., NO2 declined by 34% in 2020 vs. 2019), confirming model reliability. Transfer learning further refined the accuracy, reducing RMSE by 32–44% across pollutants when benchmarked against real-world data. Notable NO2 declines were observed in Beijing (42%), Changchun (38%), and Wuhan (36%), primarily due to decreased vehicular traffic and industrial activity. Despite occasional anomalies caused by localized events such as fireworks (Beijing, February 2020) and agricultural burning (Changchun, April 2020), our findings highlight the strong influence of human activity reductions on urban air quality. These results offer valuable insights for designing long-term pollution mitigation strategies and urban air quality policies. © 2025 by the authors.",no,No,No,No
Continental aerosol properties and absorption retrieval using random forest machine learning method specific to geostationary remote sensing,"The utilization of satellite remote sensing images for retrieving aerosol optical parameters has been extensively discussed over the past few decades. While employing machine learning models is indeed a viable approach, a significant portion of these studies still rely on redundant data. Moreover, the discussion regarding aerosol absorption, a crucial factor for determining aerosol radiative impact and distinguishing aerosol components, is limited in current machine learning studies. In this study, we propose a random forest model to retrieve high-precision aerosol properties and their absorption over land from Himawari-8 geostationary satellite images. Remarkably, this model attains a high degree of accuracy in estimating aerosol optical depth (AOD), absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD), and single scattering albedo (SSA) of heavy air mass using only seven primary predictors (observational radiances or their mathematical combinations, geometries, and wavelength). For AOD, the new random forest model demonstrates excellent performance on an hourly scale (R2 ≥ 0.89, MAE < 0.07, RMSE <0.13), >80% of the samples fall within the expected error (EE) range. Concerning AAOD, the validation indicates that at least 65% of AAODs have a bias of ≤50%, with an R2 exceeding 0.78, MAE ≤ 0.008 and RMSE ≤0.016. SSA also demonstrates a high accuracy (R2 ≥ 0.57, MAE < 0.03, RMSE <0.05), with >70% of the results have an error ≤ 0.03. Through more comprehensive independent spatiotemporal cross validation, it can be determined that the model also offers reliable spatial and temporal predictions. The proposed RF model is capable of learning aerosol properties under most atmosphere scenarios, providing a reasonable conversion from predictors to AOD and AAOD/SSA under high aerosol loadings. The spatial patterns of these parameters suggest that the retrievals show considerable potential in capturing high aerosol loading in East Asia and biomass burning in Southeast Asia. The method introduced in this study offers a new approach to obtaining aerosol properties from geostationary satellite remote sensing, featuring a flexible process, simple inputs, high accuracy, and enhanced robustness. Additionally, it furnishes supplementary insights into aerosol absorption, presenting new possibilities in determining aerosol radiative impact and distinguishing aerosol components. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",no,No,No,No
"Comparison of PAH mass emissions and their toxicity-weighted trends in China, 2000–2022","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions are often used as direct evidence for subsequent environmental monitoring, governance, and policy-making. However, the toxicity among individual PAH varies significantly, causing their toxicity-based risk to be overlooked. The analysis revealed that total PAH emissions (EΣPAHs) has peaked in 2007 (i.e., 1.1 × 105 t), then declined to 2022 (i.e., 7.4 × 104 t) in China. However, the toxicity-weighted PAH emissions (EΣTEQ) has not decreased, because the emissions of high molecular weight PAH (EΣHPAHs) with high toxicity has not decreased, although the emissions of low molecular weight PAH (EΣLPAHs) with low toxicity has decreased significantly. It was verified that the trend of variation in PAH emissions is comprehensively determined by the decrease in biomass and increase in fossil fuel consumption. The decline in EΣLPAHs from biomass burning exceeded emission increases attributable to fossil fuel combustion, driving an overall reduction in total LPAHs post-2007 of China. In contrast, EΣHPAHs exhibited temporal variability after 2007, as emission reductions from biomass burning were offset by comparable increases from fossil fuel. Despite efforts to reduce emissions of conventional atmospheric pollutants, EΣTEQ have not decreased due to the rising fossil fuel consumption and limited pollution control efficiency on EΣHPAHs. The findings addressed the gap between PAH mass emissions and their toxicity-weighted trends, which enabled us to pay attention to the variation of EΣTEQ for accurate risk management to any region with shifting PAH source profiles. Moreover, emphasis should be placed on transitioning fossil fuel consumption to clean energy and implementing effective measures to reduce EΣHPAHs in flue gas, such as adsorption and degradation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",no,No,No,No
"Climatology, trend and correlations of aerosol, cloud and meteorology over the climatologically important monsoon and adjacent northern regions of Pakistan","Quantifying changes in aerosols, cloud characteristics, and their correlations on both spatial and temporal scales is essential for understanding future climate changes. In this study, 11 years (2009–2019) of aerosol, meteorological, and cloud datasets are analyzed to evaluate climatology, trends, and their relationships over the climatologically important core monsoon- (R1) region and the adjacent high-altitude northern (R2) region of Pakistan. The study utilizes Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) data for aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom Exponent (AE), CLARA-A3 data for liquid cloud properties such as cloud droplet effective radius (CER), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), cloud geometrical thickness (CGT), and liquid water path (LWP), and ERA-5 data for meteorological variables at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°. Negative trend in AE over both the R1 and R2 regions (−5 % and −10 %) are observed which could be due to deforestation, increasing temperature, and changing precipitation patterns that may disturb the dust activity and monsoon circulations. The concurrent increasing trend in AOD (12.4 %) and Aerosol Index (AI) (3.2 %) is observed over R1, likely driven by rapid urbanization, industrialization, and biomass burning. Conversely, a decreasing trend in AOD (−7.0 %) and AI (−14.14 %) is observed over R2, possibly due to anthropogenic emission control policies in China, that reduces aerosol inflow in remote areas, including the high-altitude R2 region. Positive trends are observed in CDNC, CER, CGT, COT, and LWP, with percent changes of 9.2 %, 20.7 %, 4.06 %, 6.7 %, and 10.7 % over R1 region and 34.7 %, 5.4 %, 16.98 %, 21.9 %, and 24.8 % over R2 region, respectively. Meteorological variables, including mixing ratio (q), geopotential (z), convective available potential energy (CAPE), horizontal wind speed at 10 m above the surface (si10m), dew point temperature at 2 m (d2m) and temperature at 2 m (t2m), show positive trends over both R1 and R2 regions. Correlation analysis reveals positive AOD-CDNC and negative AOD-CER relationships in both regions. In contrast, AI-COT, AI-CGT and AI-LWP correlations are negative (−0.13, −0.26 and −0.20) over R1 region but insignificant weak negative AI-CGT (−5.7 × 10−6) and positive AI-COT (0.099) and AI-LWP (0.061) are observed over R2 region. The contrasting behavior of AI-COT and AI-LWP correlations can be attributed to the difference in cloud regime and meteorological conditions over the R1 and R2 regions. The results of this study provide critical insights into aerosol-cloud-meteorology interactions, with implications for regional climate modeling, monsoon variability, and future climate projections. The findings also contribute to global aerosol-cloud research by emphasizing the importance of region-specific mechanisms in shaping aerosol-cloud interactions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",no,No,No,No
Study on global atmospheric aerosol type identification from combined satellite and ground observations,"Accurate identification of aerosol types is essential for understanding the radiative properties of aerosols and further studying aerosol regional and global climate effects. However, aerosol type identification studies combining satellite and ground observations are rare. In this paper, an aerosol type identification model based on aerosol relative optical depth (AROD) and volume depolarization ratio (VDR) is developed by effectively matching satellite and ground observation data. The accuracy and applicability of the new model are verified by typical AERONET sites with dominant aerosols, and the spatial distribution characteristics of aerosol types in global continents are also studied and analyzed with joint observation data from 2018 to 2023 globally. The results show that the East Asian continent, North America, and Europe are the main source regions for continental aerosol emissions. Among the continents, densely populated East/Southeast Asia is more heavily polluted by anthropogenic aerosols than other continents, while North America and Europe are relatively less polluted. The Indo-China Peninsula, central and southern Africa, central South America, and central and northern North America are the main source emission regions of global biomass burning aerosol, while northern Africa, West Asia, and Central Asia emit most of the global dust and polluted dust aerosols. Additionally, marine aerosols are more frequent along the east coast of North America, the west coast of Africa, the Malay Archipelago, and some island sites. The present study provides a basis for aerosol type identification using joint observation data and effectively promotes research in related fields. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",yes,No,No,Yes
Release of Organochlorine Pollutants from Forest Fires: 1. Emission Factors and Revisiting Their Emissions in the Himalayan Regions,"Worldwide forest fires have occurred frequently in recent years, a result of which may be the emission of so-called “legacy” organochlorine pollutants (OCPs) accumulated in forests. However, few studies have measured the emission factors (EFs) of the toxicity of the OCPs from forest fires. In this study, the EFs of vegetation burning were observed in forests along the altitudinal gradient from 1000 to 4200 m, and the EFs of ∑DDTs (dechlorodiphenylthrichloroethanes), HCB (hexachlorobenzene), ∑HCHs (hexachlorocyclohexanes), and ∑PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were 2050 ± 1175, 379 ± 409, 48 ± 51, and 65 ± 59 ng/kg, respectively. Re-evaporation was the primary mechanism of the emission of OCP from forest fires. The masses of HCB, β-HCH, o,p′-DDD, p,p′-DDD, and PCB-28 in smoke increased 3-7 times compared with those in unburnt vegetation, suggesting the formation of these pollutants by the pyrolysis of biomass or other pollutants. Based on the observed EFs, previously estimated quantities of fire-emitted OCPs in the Himalayan regions were revisited. The DDT emissions from the Himalayan forest fires increased ∼70% compared with the previous estimation (from 19 to 32 kg/year). This highlighted that the EF observations could decrease the uncertainties of estimating OCP emissions from forest fires, which is helpful in revealing the potential roles of forest fires on global POP cycling. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",no,No,No,No
Critical review of air pollution contribution in Delhi due to paddy stubble burning in North Indian States,"The application of diverse methods/tools (satellite data, ground-based monitoring and dispersion modelling) for quantitative assessment of air pollution has created a critical challenge for policymakers, in understating the actual stubble burning contribution in North Indian states including Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh. Considering the variations in monitoring sites, quantified emissions, satellite data resolutions, parameterization schemes, meteorology and/or adopted models, huge differences in the source contribution are reported. Considering these ambiguities, the present study is an attempt to review the studies revealing actual paddy stubble burning contribution to air quality of Delhi conducted year 2015 onwards; one year before the severe episodic smog event of November 2016. A total of 114 articles were searched using different keywords for subsequent in-depth analysis. The biomass burning share was broadly studied for winter, summer and post-monsoon seasons. Further, to understand the season-specific nature of the paddy stubble burning activity, the analysis was restricted to post-monsoon months. A co-occurrence keyword network analysis was performed based on which biomass/stubble burning related studies were divided into three clusters based on i) source apportionment using receptor modeling, ii) satellite data (AOD values coupled with ground-based observation and wind back trajectory and, iii) regional scale chemical transport modeling approach. Some studies were generalized displaying correlation patterns, some used only fire count data and correlated with AOD while some used either satellite data or regional scale models. Learning from the gap analysis of the reviewed studies led to the development of an integrated assessment protocol to quantify the stubble-burning contribution in the region. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",yes,No,No,Yes
Modeling the impacts of open biomass burning on regional O3 and PM2.5 in Southeast Asia considering light absorption and photochemical bleaching of Brown carbon,"Open biomass burning in Southeast Asia has significant adverse impacts on air quality in the region and in downwind areas. These biomass burning events emit large amounts of light absorbing brown carbon (BrC). Once in the atmosphere, the light absorbing capacity of BrC is reduced by various oxidation processes. However, few modeling studies have been conducted to explicitly examine light absorption and bleaching on the prediction of ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In this study, a modified Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model that explicitly tracks the concentrations of light absorbing and non-light absorbing organic aerosol components from different emission sources and the bleaching of BrC due to photooxidation and OH oxidation is applied to widespread open biomass burning events in March 2018 in Southeast Asia. Open biomass burning accounts for as much as 20–40 ppb (30–50%) of the maximum daily average 8-h ozone (MDA8 O3) and 40–120 μg m−3 (60–90%) of the daily average PM2.5 in the emission source regions. Compared to a simulation without BrC light absorption, the predicted MDA8 O3 and PM2.5 are as much as 16 ppb and 16 μg m−3 lower, respectively, than a simulation with light absorption. This confirms that neglecting the UV light absorption of BrC can lead to significant overpredictions of O3 and PM2.5 during the open biomass burning periods, which may lead to an overestimation of the adverse impacts of biomass burning on public health in Southeast Asia. The addition of BrC bleaching results in a 0.5–1% increase in MDA8 O3 and 1–5% increase in PM2.5 compared to the case without BrC bleaching. The results of this study indicate that light absorption by BrC needs to be considered in chemical transport modeling of large open biomass burning events. The BrC bleaching process is relatively slow and neglecting this process does not significantly change the predictions of MDA8 O3 and PM2.5 during open biomass burning. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",yes,No,No,Yes
The Lack of Real-Time Air Pollution Monitoring in Africa Supports Environmental Injustice,"Poor air quality has become a daily occurrence throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa because of urbanization, emission sources from transportation, industrial pollution, energy extractive industries, seasonal dust storms, and biomass burning at local and regional scales. Additionally, elements of environmental injustice exist requiring observations near emission sources. The lack of real-time measurements of air quality limits actions to understand, predict, and protect the public, especially vulnerable populations. Low-cost measurements can provide real-time data, and data from 2021–2022 suggest negative pulmonary health implications. Low-cost observations increase science capacity to enabling analysis and publishing of work for air quality by African scientists. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",no,No,No,No
Analysis of Aerosol Optical Mixing Using the EOMOS Model From Typical AERONET Sites,"Satellite remote sensing predominantly employs optical properties for aerosol classification, often neglecting aerosol mixing and lacking validation accuracy. This study defines five aerosol types: marine, continental, dust, urban-industrial, and biomass-burning. Proposing the external optical mixing optimization solver (EOMOS) model based on the external mixing assumption, the model's accuracy is enhanced by approximately 95.0% through constraints and optimization. Perturbation experiments on particle size distribution and complex refractive index validate the model's robustness. The EOMOS model analyzes aerosol mixing states, and quantifies contributions to aerosol optical depth (AOD) for each aerosol type, surpassing traditional methods by at least 139.7%. Additionally, the EOMOS model examines trends in aerosol type AOD, revealing a noticeable post-2013 reduction in AOD of urban-industrial aerosols in Beijing, suggesting pollution mitigation. In Brazil, urban-industrial and biomass-burning aerosol AODs were 328.1% and 107.7% higher in 2005, 2007, and 2010, primarily due to fire impact. © 2024. The Author(s).",yes,No,No,Yes
"Comparison of satellite and ground-based measurements of erythemal dose from two tropical sites: Belo Horizonte (20° S, 44° W, 858 m) and Saint-Denis La Reunion (21° S, 55° E, 85 m)","The ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the Sun on the Earth surface depends on the altitude and surface albedo of the site, solar zenith angle (SZA), attenuation in the atmosphere (absorption by ozone and other trace gases, molecular scattering, scattering by clouds, and scattering and absorption by aerosols). Belo Horizonte (BH, 20° S, 44° W, 858 m a.s.l.) and Saint-Denis La Reunion (SDR, 21° S, 55° E, 85 m a.s.l.) are two very-similar-latitude tropical sites to which the incidence of solar UVR is compared. Despite the statistically significant difference in both altitude and total ozone column (TOC), where SDR has lower altitude and higher TOC, the annual averages of climatological daily erythemal dose (DED) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) for the sites show only -1% difference (SDR-BH·100%/BH): 4486 ± 1621 (1 standard deviation) J m−2 for BH and 4434 ± 1687 J m−2 for SDR. Equivalent ground-based data are 13% and 11% (OMI-site∙100%/site), respectively, lower: 3976 ± 1072 J m−2 for BH and 4012 ± 1199 J m−2 for SDR with 1% difference between them. The comparison between the sites of atmospheric geophysical parameters of TOC, cloud fraction (CF), and UV aerosol index (AI) from OMI indicates clouds and aerosols as the main culprit to such a small difference. After clouds, aerosols play an important role, as BH is a metropolis polluted mainly by by-products from fossil-fuel and ethanol combustion and smoke from surrounding biomass burning sources, while SDR is virtually a pristine seashore locality affected by marine and long-distance biomass burning aerosols. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.",no,No,No,No
Spatial and seasonal variations and trends in carbon monoxide over China during 2013–2022,"Carbon monoxide (CO) pollution is one of the unsolved atmospheric environmental issues over countries worldwide. Here, we comprehensively assess the spatial-seasonal variations and trends in CO over China during 2013–2022, by site categorization and cause analysis, which have not been reported in previous studies. Our analysis is based on surface observations, statistical classification techniques, and sensitivity simulations from a global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem. The results show that CO concentrations and their seasonal variation are higher over the North China Plain than other areas of China during 2013–2022. CO concentrations have decreased at −38.2 ± 31.4 ppbv yr−1 (−3.7% ± 1.8% yr−1) over China during 2013–2022. The declining trends in CO concentrations vary with space, stronger over larger, more polluted, and more industralized cities. GEOS-Chem simulations suggest that the decrease in CO anthropgenic emissions in China would be the main driver for the decreasing trends of CO over China, with a contribution of 80% to the trend. Meteorology, CO anthropgenic emissions over foreign regions, and emissions from biomass burning are the remaining drivers. Our results suggest remarkable benefits of emission reductions in China in abating CO pollution and enhance our understanding on trends of long-term CO pollution over China during 2013–2022. © 2025 The Authors",no,No,No,No
Mapping the constituent preference of tree species for capturing particulate matter on leaf surfaces using single-particle mass spectrometry and supervised machine learning,"Respiratory health is negatively influenced by the dimensions and constituents of particulate matter (PM). Although mass concentration is widely acknowledged to be key to assessing dust retention by urban trees, the role of plant leaves in filtering PM from the urban atmosphere, particularly regarding the particle dimensions and chemical constituents of retained PM on the leaf, remains elusive. Here we combined single-particle aerosol mass spectrometry and a particle resuspension chamber to investigate how urban tree species capture PM constituents. Results indicate that leaves are efficient in capturing relatively larger particles (1.0–2.0 μm). Compositionally, airborne particles were mostly composed of elemental carbon (EC, 20%), organic carbon (OC, 17%), and secondary reaction products (13%). However, leaf surfaces revealed a preference for retaining crustal species, comprising 55% of captured particulates. Notably, specific tree species demonstrated varied affinities for different PM constituents: Osmanthus fragrans Lour. predominantly captured levoglucosan (LEV), indicative of its efficiency against biomass burning particles, whereas Cinnamomum camphora (L.) J.Presl and Sabina chinensis var. kaizuca W.C.Cheng & W.T.Wang were more effective in capturing heavy metals (HMs). XGBoost modelling identified indicator ions, e.g., CN−, NO3−, NO2−, PO3−, with SHAP values surpassing 0.035, suggesting a preferential adsorption of these ions among different tree species. These findings demonstrate that the particulate capture efficiency of urban tree species varies with species-specific leaf properties, particularly in their ability to selectively adsorb particles containing hazardous constituents such as LEV and HMs. This study provides a scientific basis for the strategic selection of tree species in urban forestry initiatives aimed at improving air quality and public health. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",no,No,No,No
Observational evidence reveals the significance of nocturnal chemistry in seasonal secondary organic aerosol formation,"Oxidized Organic Aerosol (OOA), a major component of fine atmospheric particles, impacts climate and human health. Previous experiments and atmospheric models emphasize the importance of nocturnal OOA formation from NO3· oxidation of biogenic VOCs. This seasonal study extends the understanding by showing that nocturnal oxidation of biomass-burning emissions can account for up to half of total OOA production in fall and winter. It is the first to distinguish nocturnal OOA characteristics from daytime OOA across all seasons using bulk aerosol measurements. Summer observations of nocturnal OOA align well with regional chemistry transport model predictions, but discrepancies in other seasons reveal a common model deficiency in representing biomass-burning emissions and their nocturnal oxidation. This study underscores the significance of near-ground nocturnal OOA production, proposes a method to differentiate it using bulk aerosol measurements, and suggests model optimization strategies. These findings enhance the understanding and prediction of nighttime OOA formation. © The Author(s) 2024.",no,No,No,No
Predicting tropospheric nitrogen dioxide column density in South African municipalities using socio-environmental variables and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression,"Atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollution is a major health and social challenge in South African induced mainly by fossil fuel combustions for power generation, transportation and domestic biomass burning for indoor activities. The pollution level is moderated by various environmental and social factors, yet previous studies made use of limited factors or focussed on only industrialised regions ignoring the contributions in large parts of the country. There is a need to assess how socio-environmenral factors, which inherently exhibit variations across space, influence the pollution levels in South Africa. This study therefore aimed to predict annual tropospheric NO2 column density using socio-environmental variables that are widely proven in the literature as sources and sinks of pollution. The environmental variables used to predict NO2 included remotely sensed Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Temperature and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) while the social data, which were obtained from national household surveys, included energy sources data, settlement patterns, gender and age statistics aggregated at municipality scale. The prediction was accomplished by applying the Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression that fine-tunes the spatial scale of each variable when building geographically localised relationships. The model returned an overall R2 of 0.92, indicating good predicting performance and the significance of the socio-environmental variables in estimating NO2 in South Africa. From the environmental variables, AOD had the most influence in increasing NO2 pollution while vegetation represented by EVI had the opposite effect of reducing the pollution level. Among the social variables, household electricity and wood usage had the most significant contributions to pollution. Communal residential arrangements significantly reduced NO2, while informal settlements showed the opposite effect. The female proportion was the most important demographic variable in reducing NO2. Age groups had mixed effects on NO2 pollution, with the mid-age group (20–29) being the most important contributor to NO2 emission. The findings of the current study provide evidence that NO2 pollution is explained by socio-economic variables that vary widely across space. This can be achieved reliably using the MGWR approach that produces strong models suited to each locality. © 2024 Hlatshwayo et al.

Spatiotemporal estimation of hourly PM2.5 using AOD derived from geostationary satellite Fengyun-4A and machine learning models for Greater Bangkok,"This study used four individual machine learning (ML) models (random forest, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting), and a stacked ensemble model (SEM) for PM2.5 estimation over Greater Bangkok (GBK) during the dry season for 2018–2022. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Fengyun-4A satellite was used as the main predictor variable. The other predictor variables include meteorological variables, fire hotspots, vegetation index, terrain elevation, and population density. Surface PM2.5 from 17 air quality monitoring stations was used for model development and evaluation. Satellite AOD aligns reasonably well with AOD from two AERONET stations in the study area in terms of correlation coefficient (r), mean bias (MB), mean error (ME), and root mean square error (RMSE). Among the individual models, adaptive boosting performed the best with r = 0.75, MB = 0.55 µg m−3, ME = 9.1 µg m−3, and RMSE = 12.9 µg m−3. As for SEM which comprises all individual models, it outperformed every individual model, with r = 0.84, zero MB, ME = 7.2 µg m−3, and RMSE = 10.4 µg m−3. In two additional cases of haze hours and clean hours, SEM is best overall while adaptive boosting is superior to the other individual ML models. The case of haze hours has lower model predictability, suggesting elevated PM2.5 is difficult to predict. SEM was thus chosen to map PM2.5 as well as exposure intensity over GBK. Good agreement between the observed and predicted diurnal and monthly patterns is achieved by every model. PM2.5 tends to be relatively high at 08–10 LT and declines in later hours, corresponding to higher traffic emissions in the morning and daytime meteorological conditions more favorable to dilute air pollutants, respectively. PM2.5 intensifies in the winter but decreases in March and April. During these two months, the areas outside Bangkok tend to have higher PM2.5 than within Bangkok, possibly linked to active summertime biomass burning in those areas that are less urbanized with more agricultural lands. Relatively high exposure intensity is constrained to Bangkok due likely to its much denser population. The findings indicate a significant potential for leveraging the Fengyun-4A satellite data and ML to advance space-based air quality monitoring for Thailand and other data-scare regions in Southeast Asia. A satellite-based PM2.5 dataset could support the formulation of effective air quality management strategies in GBK. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",no,No,No,No
Source-specific health effects of internally exposed organics in urban PM2.5 based on human serum albumin adductome analysis,"Once inhaled, organic compounds in ambient PM2.5 permeate the bloodstream, resulting in internal exposure. The intricate composition of these internalized organic molecules complicates the processes of source attribution and toxicity assessment. A systematic framework to assess the health impacts of water-soluble organic molecules (WSOMs) originating from diverse sources is still undeveloped. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the source-specific health effects of internalized organics in urban PM2.5 through human serum albumin (HSA) non-covalent adductomes with WSOMs. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and machine learning, we mapped HSA-WSOM interactions, uncovering WSOM's potential internal exposure through its HSA adductome. The study identified eight distinct sources of internalized WSOMs, primarily from biogenic emissions, gasoline exhaust, and biomass combustion. Notably, WSOMs from these sources exhibited a predominant interaction with HSA residues ARG257, LEU238, and TRP150, substantially altering the functional dynamics of fatty acid binding site two and the hydrophobic cavity via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The primary health impacts of internalized WSOMs were identified as neurotoxicity and respiratory toxicity. WSOMs originating from biogenic sources and ocean emissions were mainly responsible for neurotoxic effects, whereas those from biomass burning and gasoline exhaust predominantly caused respiratory toxicity. Using the HSA adductome framework, our study identifies source-specific profiles and health effects of internally exposed WSOMs in urban PM2.5, emphasizing the importance of targeted mitigation strategies. © 2024",yes,No,No,Yes
The Role of the Intertropical Convergence Zone on the Aerosol Transport Pathways From Africa Towards the Western Tropical Atlantic Ocean,"This study investigates the pathways of aerosol transport from Africa towards the Western Tropical Atlantic Ocean (WTAO), and the consequent deposition of terrigenous particulates in the ocean's surface, especially relating the deposition of these elements with the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The work uses meteorological, oceanographic and geochemical data collected in situ during the PIRATA (Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic) BR-XVIII (hereinafter P18) campaign performed in October–November 2018 in along the 38° W meridian between 1° S and 15° N. Atmospheric radiosondes and Expendable Bathythermographs (XBTs), launched from aboard the Brazilian Navy, Research Vessel (R/V) Vital de Oliveira, allowed us to delineate the exact latitudinal band of the ITCZ and the associated ocean divergence occurring in the study area and period. Surface water samples were taken along the ship's track at the same locations where radiosondes and XBTs were launched. After processing in the laboratory, the water samples allowed us to estimate the concentrations of lithogenic, suspended particulate aluminium and iron in surface water. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) back-trajectory model was used to reconstruct the transport paths of aerosols (including aluminium and iron) originating from the African continent towards the WTAO, as well as the relation of these paths with the ITCZ position during the study period. Our results underline the influence of the ITCZ position on the aerosol paths and on the aluminium and iron deposition in the WTAO. The ITCZ position during the study period was, particularly, important for modulating the deposition of aluminium and iron in surface waters at about 10° N, the northern edge of the ITCZ at the time. This modulation was evident in the spatial distribution of the studied minerals at sea surface along the 38° W meridian, suggesting a barrier effect of the ITCZ on aerosol transport south of 10° N. Using satellite-derived data of several sources, this study also identified the seasonal variations in aerosol inputs from Africa towards the open sea, with mineral dust predominantly originating from the Sahara and biomass burning aerosols originating from central and sub-Saharan Africa. The unique integration of observational atmospheric, oceanographic and geochemical data used here allowed a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean for modulating the deposition of aluminium and iron in the WTAO. These minerals are key to more complex processes such as the ocean's fertilisation and consequent productivity. Nevertheless, the possibility of other sources of minerals contributing to the concentrations found in the study area cannot be ruled out. These other sources can be the Amazon River discharge and the proximity of the Brazilian coast in the southern part of the 38° W meridian. In this sense, future complementary studies are indicated to be performed in our study region. © 2025 Royal Meteorological Society.",no,No,No,No
Investigation of fire regime dynamics and modeling of burn area over India for the twenty-first century,"The characteristics of the vegetation fire (VF) regime are strongly influenced by geographical variables such as regional physiographic settings, location, and climate. Understanding the VF regime is extremely important for managing and mitigating the impacts of fires on ecosystems, communities, and human activities in forest fire-prone regions. The present study thereby aimed to explore the potential effects of the confounding factors on VF in India to offer actionable and achievable solutions for mitigating this concurring environmental issue sustainably. A global burn area (250 m) data (Fire-CCIv5.1) and fire radiative power (FRP) were used to investigate the dynamics of VF across seven different divisions in India. The study also used the maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, population density, and intensity of human modification to model forest burn areas (including grassland). The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-6 (CMIP6) was used to predict the burn area for 2030 and 2050 future climate scenarios. The present study accounted for a sizable increasing trend of VF during 2001–2019 period. The highest increasing trend was found in central India (513 and 343 km2 year−1 in the forest and crop fire, respectively), followed by southern India (364 km2 year−1 in forest fire), and upper Indo-Gangetic plain (128 km2 year−1 in crop fire). The FRP has varied significantly across the divisions, with the north-eastern Himalayas exhibiting the highest FRP hotspot. The maximum and minimum temperatures have the greatest influence on forest fires, according to Random Forest (RF) modeling. The estimated pre-monsoonal burn area for 2050 and 2050 future scenarios suggested a more frequent forest fire occurrence across India, particularly in southern and central India. A comprehensive forest fire control policy is therefore essential to safeguard and conserve forest cover in the regions, affected by forest fire periodically. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",yes,No,Yes,No
Temporal distributions of aerosols over the Horn of Africa–Ethiopia using MODIS satellite data: Part 01,"There are large temporal variations in the optical properties and types of aerosols. These are due to the effects of environmental and meteorological conditions, industrial and agricultural influences, and other human influences and natural factors in each ecological functional area. Aerosol optical depth AOD and Ångström exponent AE parameters were extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS satellite with a 3 km resolution of MOD04_3K and MYD04_3K. The study covers sixteen selected stations in Horn Africa–Ethiopia with neighboring Eritrea, Djibouti, and South Sudan countries clustered into four regions for the periods of 2001–2022 to obtain detailed information on the temporal behaviors and classification of aerosols in each season. The results show that the temporal variability of AOD and AE values is large, with values ranging from 0.00 to 2.10 and 0.67 to 1.23, with minimum values most likely between December 16 and January 07, and maximum values between June 22 and July 24 for both Terra and Aqua in the southeast and northeast clusters, respectively. The lowest AOD and AE values were most common in the Belg (during September–November) and sometimes in Bega (during December–February), while the highest were in the Kiremt season (during June–August). The minimum values were observed at the Kebri Dahar site, and the maximum were at the Erta Ale site, which belongs to Ethiopia. Appropriate AOD and AE thresholds were used to classify the aerosol types into marine (MR), dust (DS), biomass burning (BB), desert dust (DD), urban (UR), and the residual cases were considered mixture (MX) types. The study concludes that marine aerosols were the most abundant at 47.71%, followed by urban aerosols at 28.29%, while desert dusts, enriched at 14.65%, accounted for the third place with free of dust particles. The Mann–Kendall (MK) statistical trend test was applied to the annual time series in all clustered regions and shows an almost positive increasing variability with a slight decrease in the forward series and vice–versa. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",yes,No,No,Yes
Patchy Response of Cheatgrass and Nontarget Vegetation to Indaziflam and Imazapic Applied After Wildfire in Sagebrush Steppe,"Control of nonnative grasses is needed where they are altering fire regimes and degrading rangelands, such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) invasion of perennial sagebrush-steppe communities. Aerial broadcast of the pre-emergent and postemergent herbicide imazapic has been used for decades over vast areas to control cheatgrass after fire. Recent small-scale studies indicate that the pre-emergent herbicide indaziflam may provide more enduring cheatgrass control. We evaluated landscape-level vegetation responses to indaziflam sprayed in replicated areas at 66.7 g · ai · ha−1, with and without imazapic (66.1 g · ai · ha−1) over almost 500 ha of sagebrush steppe. Herbicides were strip-sprayed by helicopter in the fall of 2019 in subregions that either 1) had burned in the summer of 2019 and had moderate background cheatgrass invasion, 2) had burned in 2011 and became heavily invaded, or 3) were burned in both 2011 and 2019 and had intermediate invasion. Tarps were temporarily deployed to intercept herbicides and create untreated controls. Overall, indaziflam + imazapic had greater initial control of cheatgrass, but by 2023, both treatments led to similar ∼17 percentage-point reductions in cheatgrass cover. Cheatgrass individuals that “escaped” the herbicide treatment grew exceptionally large and fecund. There were no reductions in cover in any native vegetation type, including biocrusts, and nontarget increases in cover were observed for 1) deep-rooted perennial grasses treated with indaziflam + imazapic in the 2011 burn subregion and 2) the shallow-rooted Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda) treated with either herbicide in the 2011 or 2011 + 2019 burn subregions. Consideration of burn legacies, pretreatment landscape condition, and evenness of treatment application may improve restoration outcomes and help prioritize management allocation, timing, and treatment expectations. © 2024 The US Geological Survey",no,No,No,No
Reviewing the methodologies used to assess household PM2.5 air pollution in sub-Saharan Africa,"Exposure to household air pollution (HAP) is a major global health issue in low- and middle-income countries, with exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) a major risk factor for a wide range of diseases. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has unique contextual challenges for assessing HAP exposure, it is critical that learning from existing research is applied in future research. Reviews conducted to date have not considered in detail the methods applied when deploying PM2.5 sensors to measure indoor air quality, nor did they focus on HAP. A review of HAP PM2.5 measurement studies in SSA was conducted, focusing on measurement methods in order to understand how monitors have been deployed in the region. A search and extraction following PRISMA guidelines was applied. After exclusions, 51 papers were reviewed and information related to HAP sampling methods was extracted. Common themes in methodologies, assessing their effectiveness, and gaps in future research were highlighted. The findings highlight a considerable lack of research into HAP in the region where there is both an increasing population and an increase in the use of unclean fuels. A lack of standardisation in measurement practices was also identified. A key finding is the necessity for calibration of low-cost sensors against reference instruments within the region where they are deployed and calibrated against specific emission sources. This review provides recommendations to improving the accuracy and reliability of HAP measurement in SSA as well as key learnings for future larger-scale exposure and epidemiological studies to inform robust public health policy. © 2024 The Authors",no,No,No,No
Improving residential wood burning emission inventories with the integration of readily available data sources,"Residential wood burning (RWB) is the largest anthropogenic source of PM2.5 in many North American and European cities in the winter. The current lack of information on the locations, types, and intensity of use of wood burning appliances limits the ability to accurately assess the exposure of the population to RWB emissions. In this study, we generated a high spatial resolution emission inventory for RWB in the province of Quebec, Canada using a novel data driven approach. The method first combines real estate and socioeconomic census data through machine learning models to estimate ownership rates of fireplaces and wood stoves. These ownership rates are then combined with household survey data (on wood consumption and types of appliances), emission factors and building registry data to generate the emission inventory at a 1Km2 resolution. Our proposed approach was able to capture spatial patterns in RWB appliance ownership and intensity of use, which may be overlooked by using simple urban vs rural or population based spatial proxies. The machine learning models explained 80.3 % and 63 % of the variability in wood stove and fireplace ownership rates with each appliance type exhibiting different spatial trends. Wood stoves were common in rural areas and among lower income households, whereas fireplaces were more common in urban areas. Additionally, we observed large spatial and regional variability in emissions per residence due to differences in wood consumption, appliance ownership rates, and appliance mixes (e.g. conventional vs certified). Our results suggest that using simple spatial proxies based on population, urbanization levels or residence type are not enough to explain the spatial distribution of RWB emissions as they might overlook other factors such as socioeconomic factors or regional heating preferences. Finally, our spatially distributed emissions were strongly correlated (r = 0.86) with the increase in PM2.5 concentrations during peak-RWB hours on winter weekends at 42 reference stations across the province of Quebec. © 2024 The Authors",no,No,No,No
Determining an Optimal Combination of Meteorological Factors to Reduce the Intensity of Atmospheric Pollution During Prescribed Straw Burning,"Currently, large-scale burning is an important straw disposal method in most developing countries. To execute prescribed burning while mitigating air pollution, it is crucial to explore the maximum possible range of meteorological changes. This study conducted a three-year monitoring program in Changchun, a core agricultural area in Northeast China severely affected by straw burning. The data included ground-level pollutant monitoring, ground-based polarized LiDAR observations, and ground meteorological factors such as planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), relative humidity (RH), and wind speed (WS). Using response surface methodology (RSM), this study analyzed key weather parameters to predict the optimal range for emission reduction effects. The results revealed that PM2.5 was the primary pollutant during the study period, particularly in the lower atmosphere from March to April, with PM2.5 rising sharply in April due to the exponential increase in fire points. Furthermore, during this phase, the average WS and PBLH increased, whereas the RH decreased. Univariate analysis confirmed that these three factors significantly impacted the PM2.5 concentration. The RSM relevance prediction model (MET-PM2.5) established a correlation equation between meteorological factors and PM2.5 levels and identified the optimal combination of meteorological indices: WS (3.00–5.03 m/s), RH (30.00–38.30%), and PBLH (0.90–1.45 km). Notably, RH (33.1%) emerged as the most significant influencing factor, while the PM2.5 value remained below 75 μg/m3 when all weather indicators varied by less than 20%. In conclusion, these findings could provide valuable meteorological screening schemes to improve planned agricultural residue burning policies, with the aim of minimizing pollution from such activities. © 2025 by the authors.",no,No,No,No
Spatiotemporal Variability and Source Apportionment of Particulate Matter (PM) Emissions Using Binned Size Distributions: Insights from MERRA-2 Over Africa,"Particulate matter (PM) plays a crucial role in atmospheric processes, significantly impacting air quality, climate, and human health across Africa. The present study identified five distinct regions: Western, Northern, Central, Eastern and Southern Africa, each exhibiting unique PM bin characteristics and sources. This study employed the multispectral data from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) to characterize and apportion PM sources across the continent in five bins; Bin1 to Bin5. While, AERONET sun-photometry served as a validation tool at 440 nm, 500 nm and 675 nm, offering high-quality ground-based measurements. The validation of MERRA-2 model AOD data with ground-based AERONET measurements showed low, moderate and strong correlation coefficients, indicating reliable data for regional PM analysis. Further, on source apportionment, analysis identifies major PM sources, including Sahara dust, biomass burning, and urban pollution (0.0024), highlighting the implications of air pollution on human health. Notably, the Bodele Depression in Chad emerged as a dominant dust emission hotspot, contributing significantly to transboundary dust transport. The contributions of each PM dust bin over the five African regions followed a similar pattern with posting approximately 50% over all regions. However, the PM matter was noted to be high over the Northern and Western regions of Africa attributed to Sahara desert where dust storms are dominant. Basing on the findings, there is urgent need to integrate advanced data technologies into future atmospheric and environmental studies by adopting high resolution multispectral and hyper spectral remote sensing and machine learning-driven source apportionment. An effective air quality management policies should focus on mitigating dust emissions in high-risk areas such as Northern Africa and the Sahel Also, there is need to strengthen observational networks across Africa especially in regions with complex aerosol interactions that are critical in refining air quality management strategies. © King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",yes,No,No,Yes
Assessing ozone formation impact through SHAP interaction redistribution analysis: A novel framework for evaluating VOC photochemical loss and source interactions,"Despite extensive research on tropospheric ozone (O3) formation, quantifying the impact of photochemical processes on source contributions remains challenging. This study developed a SHAP interaction redistribution analysis (SIRA) framework that systematically analyzes and reallocates machine learning interpretation results to quantify photochemical impacts on O3 formation and source contributions. Based on improved photochemical age parameterization method, the mean VOC photochemical loss concentration was 7.44 ± 10.36 ppb, with alkenes, aromatics, and OVOCs showing the highest ratios of photochemical loss to observed concentrations (1.35, 0.90, and 0.66, respectively). SHAP analysis revealed meteorological factors and NO as primary contributors to O3 formation (50.82 % and 12.24 %, respectively). The importance ratio of TVOCs to NOx was 1.5 during the study period and increased to 2.4 during O3 pollution episodes, indicating VOC-limited O3 formation with enhanced VOC sensitivity during pollution periods. The SIRA framework identified secondary generation (48.38 %), biogenic emissions (13.87 %), and industrial emissions (9.33 %) as major O3 contributors under photochemical loss conditions. After redistributing secondary generation through source interaction analysis, biogenic emissions and biomass burning showed the highest increases in SHAP importance (41.18 % with mean |SHAP values| = 1.87 and 40.27 % with mean |SHAP values| = 0.98, respectively), identifying them as the primary precursor sources for secondary generation. Among anthropogenic sources, vehicle emissions became the dominant contributor with a 17.0 % increase in contribution. This framework offers an innovative approach for quantifying the photochemical impacts on source contributions, enabling more targeted and effective strategies for O3 pollution control. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",yes,No,No,Yes
Aerosol hygroscopicity over the southeast Atlantic Ocean during the biomass burning season - Part 1: From the perspective of scattering enhancement,"Aerosol hygroscopicity plays a vital role in aerosol radiative forcing. One key parameter describing hygroscopicity is the scattering enhancement factor, f(RH), defined as the ratio of the scattering coefficient at humidified relative humidity (RH) to its dry value. Here, we utilize the f(80 %) from ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) 2016 and 2018 airborne measurements to investigate the hygroscopicity of aerosols, its vertical distribution, its relationship with chemical composition, and its sensitivity to organic aerosol (OA) hygroscopicity over the southeast Atlantic (SEA) Ocean during the biomass burning (BB) season. We found that aerosol hygroscopicity remains steady above 2 km, with a mean f(80 %) of 1.40 ± 0.17. Below 2 km, aerosol hygroscopicity increases with decreasing altitude, with a mean f(80 %) of 1.51 ± 0.22, consistent with higher values of BB aerosol hygroscopicity found in the literature. The hygroscopicity parameter of OA (κOA) is retrieved from the Mie model with a mean value of 0.11 ± 0.08, which is in the middle to upper range compared to the literature. Higher OA hygroscopicity is related to aerosols that are more aged, oxidized, and present at lower altitudes. The enhanced biomass burning aerosol (BBA) hygroscopicity at lower altitudes is mainly due to a lower OA fraction, increased sulfate fraction, and greater κOA at lower altitudes. We propose a parameterization that quantifies f(RH) with chemical composition and κOA based on Mie simulation of internally mixed OA-(NH4)2SO4-BC mixtures. The good agreement between the predictions and the ORACLES measurements implies that the aerosols in the SEA during the BB season can be largely represented by the OA-(NH4)2SO4-BC internal mixture with respect to the f(RH) prediction. The sensitivity of f(RH) to κOA indicates that applying a constant κOA is only suitable when the OA fraction is low and κOA shows limited variation. However, in situations deviating these two criteria, κOA can notably impact scattering coefficients and aerosol radiative effect; therefore, accounting for κOA variability is recommended.  © 2024 Lu Zhang et al.",no,No,No,No
Viscosity and Phase State of Wildfire Smoke Particles in the Stratosphere from Pyrocumulonimbus Events: An Initial Assessment,"Understanding the viscosity and phase state of biomass-burning organic aerosol (BBOA) from wildfires and pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) events in the stratosphere is critical for predicting their role in stratospheric multiphase chemistry and ozone depletion. However, the viscosity and phase state of BBOA under stratospheric conditions, including interactions with sulfuric acid (H2SO4), remain largely unquantified. In this study, we combine laboratory data with a thermodynamic model to predict the viscosity and phase state of BBOA under stratospheric conditions. Our results suggest that BBOA with a H2SO4-to-BBOA mass ratio of 0.37─an estimated upper limit for pyroCb smoke in the lower stratosphere after two months of aging─is highly viscous and frequently exists in a glassy state. Even at a higher H2SO4-to-BBOA mass ratio of 0.79─an estimated upper limit after nine months of aging─BBOA can still transition to a glassy state under certain stratospheric conditions. In the glassy state, bulk reactions are suppressed, and multiphase chemistry may be limited to the particle surfaces. We also highlight key areas for future research needed to better constrain the viscosity and phase state of BBOA in the stratosphere and its subsequent impact on ozone. © 2025 The Authors.

How air pollution affects cause-specific emergency hospital admissions on days with biomass combustion in Spain?,"Although wildfires are growing in number, intensity and extent due to climate change, few studies have been undertaken to analyse their health impact, and fewer still to analyse the impact of variables other than particulate matter. The objective of this study is to analyse the short-term impact of NO2, PM10, PM2.5, O3 and temperature in heat waves on emergency hospital admissions in Spain on days when biomass combustion occurs. We conducted an ecological longitudinal time series study across the period 2013–2018. The dependent variables were emergency hospital admissions due to all causes (ICD-10: A00-R99), circulatory causes (ICD-10: I00-I99) and respiratory causes (ICD-10: J00-J99) in 9 representative Spanish provinces. The independent variables were daily mean air pollution concentrations measured at a provincial level. We also included daily maximum temperatures recorded at reference observatories in the respective provinces. Poisson generalised linear models were fitted for days with and without PM advections due to biomass burning smoke. We controlled for trends, seasonalities, the autoregressive nature of the series, Sundays and Public Holidays. Days with biomass burning smoke advections increased PM concentrations in all provinces and ozone in many of them, something that did not occur in equal measure in the case of NO2. Nevertheless, the principal impact on admissions was due to O3, followed by NO2, PM, and lastly, heat-wave temperatures. This pattern was observed for all three causes analysed. The role of PM was relegated to that of a third factor, and the role of temperature to an order of lesser magnitude than that of chemical pollution. To focus the health impacts of wildfires exclusively on the impact of PM concentrations would be to minimise their real impact on population health. It is therefore essential to implement integrated plans that take into account the joint effect of all atmospheric variables affected. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,No,Yes
A satellite-based analysis of semi-direct effects of biomass burning aerosols on fog and low-cloud dissipation in the Namib Desert,"In the Namib Desert, fog is the only regular water input and, thus, is a crucial water source for its fauna and flora. Each year, between June and October, absorbing biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) overlie the stratocumulus clouds in the adjacent Southeast Atlantic. In some synoptic settings, this layer of BBAs reaches Namibia and its desert, where it interacts with coastal fog and low clouds (FLCs). In this study, a novel 15-year data set of geostationary satellite observations of FLC dissipation time in the Namib Desert is used, along with reanalysis data, to better understand the potential semi-direct effects of BBAs on FLC dissipation in the Namib Desert, i.e., through adjustments of atmospheric stability and thermodynamics via the interaction of aerosols with radiation. This is done by investigating both the time of day when FLCs dissolve and the synoptic-scale meteorology depending on BBA loading. It is found that FLC dissipation time is significantly later on high-BBA-loading days. BBAs are transported to the Namib along moist free-tropospheric air by a large-scale anticyclonic recirculation pattern. At the surface, the associated longwave heating strengthens a continental heat low, which modifies the circulation and boundary layer moisture along the coastline, complicating the attribution of BBA effects. During high-BBA days, the vertical profiles of the temporal development of air temperatures highlight contrasting daytime and nighttime processes modifying the local inversion. These processes are thought to be driven by greenhouse warming as a result of the moisture in the BBA plumes and BBA absorption (only during the daytime). A statistical learning framework is used to quantify meteorological and BBA influences on FLC dissipation time. The statistical model is able to reproduce the observed differences in FLC dissipation time between high- and low-BBA days and attributes these differences mainly to differences in circulation, boundary layer moisture and near-surface air temperature along the coastline. However, the model is prone to underfitting and is not able to reproduce the majority of the FLC dissipation variability. While the model does not suggest that BBA patterns are important for FLC dissipation, the findings show how the moist BBA plumes modify local thermodynamics, to which FLC dissipation is shown to be sensitive. The findings highlight the challenges of disentangling meteorological and aerosol effects on cloud development using observations and invite detailed modeling analyses of the underlying processes, for example, with large-eddy simulations. © Author(s) 2025.",yes,No,No,Yes
Application of multi-angle spaceborne observations in characterizing the long-term particulate organic carbon pollution in China,"Ambient PM2.5 pollution poses a major risk to public health in China, contributing to significant mortality and morbidity. While overall PM2.5 concentrations have declined in recent years, the changes in PM2.5 chemical constituents remain inadequately understood due to limited ground monitoring networks. We developed a Super Learner model that integrates MISR satellite data, chemistry transport model simulations, and land use information to predict daily OC concentrations across China from 2003 to 2019 at a 10-km spatial resolution. The model achieved high predictive accuracy with a cross-validation R2 of 0.84 and an RMSE of 4.9 μg/m3. Our findings show elevated OC levels in Northern China, driven by industrial activities with concentrations exceeding 30 μg/m3 during the heating season. In contrast, forest fires were the primary contributors in Yunnan, raising OC concentrations to 20–30 μg/m3 during fire seasons. Over the 17-year period, the national OC trend declined by 1.3 % annually. Regionally, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Fenwei Plain experienced faster reductions at annual rates of 1.5 % and 2.0 %, respectively, while Yunnan exhibited no significant trends. To better understand pollution source contributions, we analyzed the OC/EC ratio, which indicated higher ratios in less populated rural areas, suggesting agricultural and biogenic emissions, while lower ratios in urban clusters pointed to primary sources such as traffic and industrial activities. Notably, since 2013, significant decreases in the OC/EC ratio have been observed in the North China Plain, likely reflecting the impact of stringent air pollution control policies on biomass burning. This study provides valuable exposure estimates for epidemiological research on the long-term health effects of OC in China, offering insights for evaluating air quality policies and guiding future management strategies. © 2024",no,No,No,No
"The Fungal and Protist Community as Affected by Tillage, Crop Residue Burning and N Fertilizer Application","The bacterial community in soil is often affected by agricultural practices, but how they affect protists and fungi is less documented. Soil from treatments that combined different N fertilizer application rates, tillage and crop residue management was sampled from a field trial started by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) at the ‘Campo Experimental Norman E. Borlaug’ (CENEB) in the Yaqui Valley in the northwest of Mexico in the early 1990s, and the fungal and protist community determined. Tillage, residue burning, and N fertilizer application had no significant effect on the fungal and protists alpha diversity expressed as Hill numbers and no significant effect on the fungal and protist community structure considering all species. The relative abundance of plant pathogens and undefined saprotrophs as determined with FUNGuildR increased significantly with tillage, while that of dung-plant and dung-soil saprotroph, and plant pathogens by burning (P < 0.05). It was found that the protists and fungal community structures were not altered by different agricultural practices, but some fungal guilds were, i.e., plant pathogens and saprotrophs, which might affect soil organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling and crop growth. © The Author(s) 2025.",yes,No,No,Yes
"Biomass burning records of the Shulehe Glacier No. 4 from Qilian Mountains, Northeastern Tibetan Plateau","Biomass burning play a key role in the global carbon cycle by altering the atmospheric composition, and affect regional and global climate. Despite its importance, a very few high-resolution records are available worldwide, especially for recent climate change. This study analyzes levoglucosan, a specific tracer of biomass burning emissions, in a 38-year ice core retrieved from the Shulehe Glacier No. 4, northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The levoglucosan concentration in the Shulehe Glacier No. 4 ice core ranged from 0.1 to 55 ng mL−1, with an average concentration of 8 ± 8 ng mL−1. The concentrations showed a decreasing trend from 2002 to 2018. Meanwhile, regional wildfire activities in Central Asian also exhibited a declining trend during the same period, suggesting the potential correspondence between levoglucosan concentration of the Shulehe Glacier No. 4 ice core and the fire activity of Central Asia. Furthermore, a positive correlation also exists between the levoglucosan concentration of the Shulehe Glacier No. 4 ice core and the wildfire counts in Central Asia from 2002 to 2018. While backward air mass trajectory analysis and fire spots data showed a higher distribution of fire counts in South Asia compared to Central Asia, but the dominance of westerly circulation in the northern TP throughout the year. Therefore, the levoglucosan in the Shulehe Glacier No. 4 provides clear evidence of Central Asian wildfire influence on Tibetan Plateau glaciers through westerlies. This highlights a great importance of ice core data for wildfire history reconstruction in the Tibetan Plateau Glacier regions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",no,No,No,No
Revisiting the high tropospheric ozone over southern Africa: role of biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions,"Tropospheric ozone over southern Africa is particularly high and causes tremendous health risks and crop yield losses. It has been previously attributed to the influence by biomass burning (BB), with a neglected contribution from anthropogenic emissions. However, due to the lack of measurements for ozone and its precursors, the modeled impacts of BB and anthropogenic emissions on tropospheric ozone levels in southern Africa were not well evaluated. In this study, we combined the nested GEOS-Chem simulation with a horizontal resolution of 0.5°×0.625° with available multiple observations at the surface and from space to quantify tropospheric ozone and its main drivers in southern Africa. Firstly, BB emissions from current different inventories exhibit similar peaks in the summer season but also have large uncertainties in southern Africa (e.g., uncertainty of a factor of 2-3 in emitted NOx). The model-satellite comparison in the fire season (July-August) in 2019 shows that using the widely used Global Fire Emissions Database version 4.1 (GFED4.1) inventory, the model tends to overestimate by 87 % compared to OMI NO2, while the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED2) inventory can greatly reduce this model bias to only 34 %. Consequently, the modeled tropospheric column ozone (TCO) bias was reduced from 14 % by GFED4.1 to 2.3 % by QFED2. In addition, the QFED2 also has a much better spatial representativeness than GFED4.1. The simulated surface daily maximum 8 h mean (MDA8) ozone was decreased from 74 ppb by GFED4.1 to only 56 ppb by QFED2. This suggests a highly overestimated role of BB emissions in surface ozone if GFED4.1 is adopted. The model-observation comparison at the surface shows that the global Community Emissions Data System (CEDSv2) anthropogenic inventory tends to underestimate anthropogenic NOx emissions in typical southern African cities and likely misrepresented anthropogenic sources in some areas. That means that urban ozone and PM2.5 concentrations in southern Africa may be strongly underestimated. For example, a 10-fold increase in anthropogenic NOx emissions can change the ozone chemistry regime and increase PM2.5 by up to 50 μgm-3 at the city of Luanda. Furthermore, we also find that TROPOMI can already capture the urban NO2 column hotspots over low-emission regions like southern Africa, while this is unavailable from the OMI instrument, highlighting the critical role of high-resolution measurements in understanding atmospheric chemistry issues over southern Africa. Our study presents a deeper understanding of the key emission sources and their impacts over southern Africa that will be helpful not only to formulate targeted pollution controls, but also to enhance the capability to predict future air quality and climate change, which would be beneficial for achieving a healthy, climate-friendly, and resilient development in Africa. © 2025 Yufen Wang et al.",yes,No,No,Yes
Improving the Air Pollution Control Measures More Efficiently and Cost-Effectively: View from the Practice in the 7th Military World Games in Wuhan,"During a mega-event, the air pollution control measures for the key city and surrounding regions were within a certain distance was always implemented. The necessity of taking the similar or even same measures everywhere is suspect. The 7th Military World Games (MWG) was held in an inland city-Wuhan, and the air pollution control regions within a cycle of diameter as 400 km, which give a good opportunity to address this problem. Compared to the air pollution control period (10/08 − 10/28) in 2019 with those from 2015 to 2018, CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2 showed negative anomalies of 0.13 ± 0.09 mg m− 3, 10.8 ± 3.34 µg m− 3, 39.3 ± 5.98 µg m− 3, 18.0 ± 3.17 µg m− 3, and 4.30 ± 2.66 µg m− 3, respectively, while O3 showed positive anomalies (9.84 ± 4.06 µg m− 3) in the core control area (Wuhan). Using the weather normalized technique, the contributions of emissions and meteorology to anomalies of air pollutants were quantified, i.e., emission variations contributed to 52.7% of PM2.5 anomalies in Wuhan. The reduced mass concentrations of elemental carbon (0.49 µg m− 3) and trace elements (0.88 µg m− 3), as well as the reductions from biomass burning (4.15 µg m− 3), vehicle emissions (2.75 µg m− 3), and coal combustion (1.03 µg m− 3) all verified the effectiveness and necessity of pollution control for local primary particles. While the elevated nitrate (6.14 µg m− 3) and sulfate (2.23 µg m− 3) concentrations during the MWG period highlighted the enhanced secondary formation when the air mass transported mainly from the north, northeastern and western regions of Wuhan, within a cycle of diameter of 300 km. The pollution control at the south regions of Wuhan is not necessary here. This study suggested that during a mega-event, the primary emission reduction of particles from local biomass burning, vehicle emission, fugitive dust as well as the NO2 and NH3 reduction from the unwind regions within a certain distance should be emphasized, which can save costs and human efforts effectively. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy Sciences 2024.",no,No,No,No
Reduction in Organic Aerosol from Coal Combustion is Partially Offset by Enhanced Secondary Formation during the Beijing Coal Burning Ban,"A coal ban policy in northern China during winter 2017 enforced a switch from coal to gas or electricity for residential heating, providing a unique opportunity to study the effect of reduced coal combustion emissions on organic aerosol (OA). This study explores OA composition, sources, and atmospheric transformations in Beijing before and during the coal ban using online aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and offline 14C measurements. Four primary factors (hydrocarbon-like, cooking, biomass burning, coal combustion OA) and one secondary factor (oxygenated OA, OOA) were resolved from ACSM. In response to the coal ban, OA concentrations generally decreased, but coal combustion OA decreased most strongly, consistent with the decreased fossil carbon contributions to OA (67 ± 3% before vs 55 ± 4% during the ban). Concurrently, the OOA fraction increased from 45 to 72%, due to a larger decrease in concentrations of primary OA (POA; 59-88%) compared to OOA (34%), highlighting the enhanced secondary aerosol formation during the coal ban period. This aligns with the 14C evidence of higher water-soluble carbon in fossil OA (which has mostly secondary sources). During the coal ban period, Ox concentrations doubled and were positively correlated with the OOA fraction, highlighting strong photochemical OA production. The results show that the reduction of POA from stringent clean air actions is partially offset by enhanced secondary OA formation. © 2025 The Authors.

Environmentally Persistent Free Radical Emissions from Indoor Burning of Pelletized Biofuels,"Pelletization of biomass fuels has been promoted as an effective alternative to mitigate particulate matter (PM) emissions from the residential burning of raw biomass materials; however, environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), a class of harmful components in PM, from the biomass pellet burning have been rarely studied yet. Here, laboratory-based combustion experiments were conducted to characterize EPFRs for different pellets burned in cooking and heating stoves and compared with those for the corresponding uncompressed biofuels. Emission factors (EFs) of EPFRs for biomass pellets ranged from 2.97 × 1017 to 2.33 × 1019 spins/kg, following a log-normal distribution, with a geometric mean of 4.21 × 1018 spins/kg. These EPFRs were carbon-centered free radicals adjacent to oxygen atoms. Emissions varied largely across different fuel-stove combinations, with the combustion efficiency and combustion temperature as key influencing factors explaining 49% of the variations in EFPR EFs. Compared to raw fuels, pelletized fuels showed 50-80% lower EPFR EFs and 40-70% lower EPFRs per PM but more different EPFR types, and there was no significant change in the degree of oxidation of the EPFRs. The burning of pellets made from crop residues in a clean cookstove can reduce nearly 90% EFPRs from the raw biomass burning, which is different from the reduction degree in PM mass. This study provides valuable data in promoting the understanding of EPFR formation and deployment of biomass pellets in the protection of air quality and human health. © 2025 American Chemical Society.",yes,No,No,Yes
Enhancing long-term trend simulation of the global tropospheric hydroxyl (TOH) and its drivers from 2005 to 2019: A synergistic integration of model simulations and satellite observations,"The tropospheric hydroxyl (TOH) radical is a key player in regulating oxidation of various compounds in Earth's atmosphere. Despite its pivotal role, the spatiotemporal distributions of OH are poorly constrained. Past modeling studies suggest that the main drivers of OH, including NO2, tropospheric ozone (TO3), and H2O(v), have increased TOH globally. However, these findings often offer a global average and may not include more recent changes in diverse compounds emitted on various spatiotemporal scales. Here, we aim to deepen our understanding of global TOH trends for more recent years (2005-2019) at 1×1°. To achieve this, we use satellite observations of HCHO and NO2 to constrain simulated TOH using a technique based on a Bayesian data fusion method, alongside a machine learning module named the Efficient CH4-CO-OH (ECCOH) configuration, which is integrated into NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) global model. This innovative module helps efficiently predict the convoluted response of TOH to its drivers and proxies in a statistical way. Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO2 observations suggest that the simulation has high biases for biomass burning activities in Africa and eastern Europe, resulting in a regional overestimation of up to 20 % in TOH. OMI HCHO primarily impacts the oceans, where TOH linearly correlates with this proxy. Five key parameters, i.e., TO3, H2O(v), NO2, HCHO, and stratospheric ozone, can collectively explain 65 % of the variance in TOH trends. The overall trend of TOH influenced by NO2 remains positive, but it varies greatly because of the differences in the signs of anthropogenic emissions. Over the oceans, TOH trends are primarily positive in the Northern Hemisphere, resulting from the upward trends in HCHO, TO3, and H2O(v). Using the present framework, we can tap the power of satellites to quickly gain a deeper understanding of simulated TOH trends and biases. © 2024 Amir H. Souri et al.",no,No,No,No
Retrievals of Biomass Burning Aerosol and Liquid Cloud Properties from Polarimetric Observations Using Deep Learning Techniques,"Biomass burning (BB) aerosols are the largest source of absorbing aerosols on Earth. Coupled with marine stratocumulus clouds (MSC), their radiative effects are enhanced and can cause cloud property changes (first indirect effect) or cloud burn-off and warm up the atmospheric column (semi-direct effect). Nevertheless, the derivation of their quantity and optical properties in the presence of MSC clouds is confounded by the uncertainties in the retrieval of the underlying cloud properties. Therefore, a robust methodology is needed for the coupled retrievals of absorbing aerosol above clouds. Here, we present a new retrieval approach implemented for a Spectro radiometric multi-angle polarimetric airborne platform, the research scanning polarimeter (RSP), during the ORACLES campaign over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean. Our approach transforms the 1D measurements over multiple angles and wavelengths into a 3D image-like input, which is then processed using various deep learning (DL) schemes to yield aerosol single scattering albedos (SSAs), aerosol optical depths (AODs), aerosol effective radii, and aerosol complex refractive indices, together with cloud optical depths (CODs), cloud effective radii and variances. We present a comparison between the different DL approaches, as well as their comparison to existing algorithms. We discover that the Vision Transformer (ViT) scheme, traditionally used by natural language models, is superior to the ResNet convolutional Neural-Network (CNN) approach. We show good validation statistics on synthetic and real airborne data and discuss paths forward for making this approach flexible and readily applicable over multiple platforms. © 2025 by the authors.",yes,No,Yes,No
Determination of rainwater quality in selected geographical areas in Kandy and Kurunegala districts,"The chemistry of rainwater would be altered affecting ecosystems including humans, due to the dissolved pollutants released mainly by anthropogenic sources. As industrial activities are steadily increased over time, the chemistry of rainwater is continuously changing. As such, it is vital to monitor the rainwater quality to predict future risks so that protective measures can be taken. In this context, this study aimed to investigate chemical characteristics of bulk precipitation in selected areas in Kandy and Kurunegala districts representing urban and semi-urban areas, namely, Kandy city, University of Peradeniya (UOP) and a suburb area of Kurunegala (Mallawapitiya) over a period of six months from May 2023 to November 2023, collecting samples on a weekly basis. A total of 75 samples were analyzed once a week for rainwater quality parameters using standard procedures. The results revealed that the Kandy, UOP and Kurunegala sites had 32%, 20% and 28% dry precipitation, respectively, although 12% of acidic precipitation was recorded in Kandy, and no acidic precipitation was recorded at the sites of UOP and Kurunegala. The volume weighted mean (VWM) total hardness values of the three sites were 5.91 mg CaCO3 L− 1 (Kandy), 3.90 mg CaCO3 L− 1 (UOP) and 4.54 mg CaCO3 L− 1 (Kurunegala), respectively, confirming the soft nature of rainwater sampled. The VWM concentrations of major anions of the Kandy site were in the order of SO42− < NO3− < Cl− while the other two sites had the order, NO3− < SO42− < Cl−. The VWM concentrations of trace metals varied in the order of Pb < Cu < Mn < Fe < Zn < Al in both Kandy and UOP sites, while in Kurunegala they varied as Pb < Mn < Cu < Fe < Zn < Al. Pearson correlation analysis showed that all three sites exhibited a very strong positive correlation between conductivity and TDS. A very strong positive correlation was shown between [Cl−] and [SO42−] in Kandy and Kurunegala. The UOP and Kurunegala sites showed a very strong positive correlation between [Al] and [Fe]. Probable sources of these pollutants include vehicular emissions, crustal origin, biomass burning, industries, and agricultural activities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",no,No,No,No
Improved biomass burning emissions from 1750 to 2010 using ice core records and inverse modeling,"Estimating fire emissions prior to the satellite era is challenging because observations are limited, leading to large uncertainties in the calculated aerosol climate forcing following the preindustrial era. This challenge further limits the ability of climate models to accurately project future climate change. Here, we reconstruct a gridded dataset of global biomass burning emissions from 1750 to 2010 using inverse analysis that leveraged a global array of 31 ice core records of black carbon deposition fluxes, two different historical emission inventories as a priori estimates, and emission-deposition sensitivities simulated by the atmospheric chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. The reconstructed emissions exhibit greater temporal variabilities which are more consistent with paleoclimate proxies. Our ice core constrained emissions reduced the uncertainties in simulated cloud condensation nuclei and aerosol radiative forcing associated with the discrepancy in preindustrial biomass burning emissions. The derived emissions can also be used in studies of ocean and terrestrial biogeochemistry. © The Author(s) 2024.",yes,No,No,Yes
Exposure to seasonal PM2.5 derived from biomass burning increased the risk of vitamin D deficiency in healthy perimenopausal women,"Objective: Southeast Asia faces problems with seasonal air pollution from biomass burning. Data regarding vitamin D deficiency and seasonal air pollution is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of seasonal air pollutants on vitamin D deficiency and the predictors of vitamin D deficiency during haze periods. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 77 peri-menopausal women. All participants were enrolled and followed at the peak and low pollutant periods, respectively. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured at both points. Data regarding 24 h particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) was obtained from the database of the Pollution Control Department of Thailand. Results: The ambient 24 h PM2.5 was higher (46.9 ± 4.7 µg/m3 vs. 11.2 ± 5.1 µg/m3, P < 0.001) at the peak pollutant period. In contrast, serum 25(OH)D level was 18.8% lower, and the incidence of vitamin D deficiency was 45.4% higher at the peak pollutant period compared to those at the low pollutant period. Seasonal air pollutants were associated with an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency by 3.5 folds [OR 3.5 (95% CI 1.1–14.6)]. The ambient 24 h PM2.5 during the peak pollutant periods was an independent predictor of vitamin D deficiency. Its threshold of 20 µg/m3 demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 75.0%, 85.7%, and 78.0%, respectively, to predict the occurrence of vitamin D deficiency. Conclusion: Seasonal air pollutants increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency. The ambient 24 h PM2.5 at 20 µg/m3 demonstrated high diagnostic performance for vitamin D deficiency. © The Author(s) 2025.",no,No,No,No
"Classifying and quantifying decadal changes in wet deposition over Southeast and East Asia using EANET, OMI, and GPCP","South East and East Asia are regions which have undergone rapid economic development, contributing a significant amount of urban and biomass burning emissions. While the connections between emissions, deposition, and impacts on the Earth System are theoretically understood, they are observationally and ill-constrained, especially with respect to the effects of a changing climate and the Monsoon. This work shows the results of a new classification scheme and Asian-Wide monthly wet deposition product based upon 16 years of surface wet deposition observations and remotely sensed trace gas and precipitation measurements throughout South East and East Asia. Specific information corresponding to underlying driving and physical processes including in-situ processing, long-range transport, and local emission sources are all considered. Scientific findings are made specifically with respect to the increased impacts of urban-scale change, long-range transport, and enhanced deposition under moderate to low precipitation conditions. Previously accepted definitions of clean and polluted areas are challenged and updated based upon more detailed analysis of the observed physical and chemical relationships and simple models. The spatial and temporal distribution of the resulting modeled wet deposition is shown to impact the oceans more significantly, and regions of land not previously thought to be heavily impacted. © 2023",no,No,No,No
Large spatiotemporal variability in aerosol properties over central Argentina during the CACTI field campaign,"Few field campaigns with extensive aerosol measurements have been conducted over continental areas in the Southern Hemisphere. To address this data gap and better understand the interactions of convective clouds and the surrounding environment, extensive in situ and remote sensing measurements were collected during the Cloud, Aerosol, and Complex Terrain Interactions (CACTI) field campaign conducted between October 2018 and April 2019 over the Sierras de Córdoba range of central Argentina. This study describes measurements of aerosol number, size, composition, mixing state, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) collected on the ground and from a research aircraft during 7 weeks of the campaign. Large spatial and multiday variations in aerosol number, size, composition, and CCN were observed due to transport from upwind sources controlled by mesoscale to synoptic-scale meteorological conditions. Large vertical wind shears, back trajectories, single-particle measurements, and chemical transport model predictions indicate that different types of emissions and source regions, including biogenic emissions and biomass burning from the Amazon and anthropogenic emissions from Chile and eastern Argentina, contribute to aerosols observed during CACTI. Repeated aircraft measurements near the boundary layer top reveal strong spatial and temporal variations in CCN and demonstrate that understanding the complex co-variability of aerosol properties and clouds is critical to quantify the impact of aerosol-cloud interactions. In addition to quantifying aerosol properties in this data-sparse region, these measurements will be valuable to evaluate predictions over the midlatitudes of South America and improve parameterized aerosol processes in local, regional, and global models.  © Copyright: 2024 Jerome D.

"A robust black carbon prediction model derived from observational datasets in the Yangtze River Delta region, China","Black carbon (BC) is a short-lived pollutant with significant environment and human health impacts. Monitoring BC is important, but its spatial coverage is limited. Therefore, predicting BC concentration is crucial in densely populated regions like the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). This study explores the machine learning (ML) models, including IAP, LASSO, RF, and SNN, to develop a robust BC prediction model for the YRD, based on BC behavior at the Dianshan Lake (DSL) site. The annual BC concentration at DSL was 1.37 μg/m3, mainly from liquid fuel combustion (68 %), biomass burning (16 %), and coal combustion contributing (16 %). The ML model was first trained with DSL data (June 2021–June 2022) and then applied to other YRD sites in four scenarios based on air mass trajectories. The SNN model had R2 values over 0.80 for all scenarios at the DSL site. The model performed better during peak traffic periods, highlighting traffic's impact on BC levels. These models were applied to the YRD sites with R2 from 0.45 to 0.84. Hangzhou (HZ, 0.75–0.81), Nanjing (NJ, 0.78–0.80), and Pudong (PD, 0.76–0.84) showed the highest results. This suggests the model effectively captures BC concentrations from sources with similar emissions and meteorological conditions. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",yes,No,No,Yes
Association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and mortality on Sumatra Island: Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) 2000–2014,"The concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter < 2.5 µm) on Sumatra Island has increased, mainly because of forest and peatland fires, transportation, and industry. Biomass burning releases partially burned carbon into the atmosphere, resulting in a smoky haze containing PM2.5. Air quality has deteriorated quickly, and PM2.5 has become a major health hazard in Indonesia. Studies on long-term exposure to PM2.5 have indicated its associations with both morbidity and mortality. Here, we measured long-term (2000–2014) exposure to PM2.5 on the basis of satellite-derived aerosol optical depth measurements (1 × 1 km2) used to predict ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. Additionally, population data on Sumatra Island residents from the fourth wave of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) were obtained. We investigated the association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and mortality with a retrospective cohort study design. A total of 2409 subjects aged ≥ 40 years participated in the IFLS-3 beginning in November 2000, and we examined mortality outcomes until the IFLS-5 in September 2014. We used Cox regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality associated with PM2.5 exposure. According to the adjusted model, the mortality HRs per 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration were 1.10 (95% CI 1.03, 1.17) for all natural causes, 1.17 (95% CI 1.05, 1.25) for cardiovascular causes, and 1.19 (95% CI 1.04, 1.36) for respiratory causes. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with all-natural, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality on Sumatra Island, where PM2.5 levels exceed the WHO and US-EPA air quality standards. © The Author(s) 2024.",no,No,No,No
"Characterization and sources of carbonaceous aerosol in ambient PM1 in Qingdao, a coastal megacity of northern China from 2017 to 2022","Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) are major chemical constituents of ambient submicron particles (PM1) and have substantial implications for air quality, climate dynamics, and human health. Long-term observations of daily mean mass concentrations of OC and EC in PM1 were conducted in Qingdao, a typical coastal megacity in northern China, in autumn and winter from Nov. 2017 to Jan. 2023. The variety in OC and EC concentrations under the active emission reduction policies of long-term carbon reduction in China, combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, were analyzed. OC and EC concentrations decreased noticeably from 8.28 ± 4.59 μg m−3 and 2.00 ± 1.17 μg m−3 during pre-COVID-19 pandemic to 6.34 ± 3.82 μg m−3 and 1.87 ± 1.01 μg m−3 during post-COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The XGBoost-SHAP model indicated that emission sources had the most significant effect on OC and EC concentrations, followed by meteorological factors. Unfavorable meteorological conditions and a substantial increase in emissions are responsible for the increase of OC and EC concentration in winter. Potential source contribution function results indicated that the southern, eastern, and central Shandong regions were the primary source areas for transporting high concentrations of carbonaceous components. Positive matrix factorization analysis suggested that carbonaceous aerosols in Qingdao predominantly originated from coal/biomass combustion (54.75%–81.78%) and local vehicle emissions (8.72%–28.73%). Compared with that before COVID-19, coal/biomass combustion's contribution to OC and EC decreased by 19% after the COVID-19 pandemic. The contribution of vehicles increased by 110%, possibly due to the increase in motor vehicles and the rapid recovery in diesel consumption in freight transportation. Prohibiting biomass burning, such as open burning of straw, and measures such as promoting low-carbon and clean production of coal-fired industrial furnaces might have played a key role in reducing OC and EC levels. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the concentration levels and sources of carbonaceous components in PM1 and provide theoretical guidance for environmental management. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",yes,No,No,Yes
Source apportionment of PM10 particles in the urban atmosphere using PMF and LPO-XGBoost,"Atmospheric particulate matter (PM), as a leading part of air pollution, affects health in many ways. Thus, identifying and quantifying the contribution of atmospheric particulate matter sources of PM is vital for developing effective air quality management strategies. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) is one of the most common methods for source apportionment. However, PMF has some limitations, particularly its assumption that each source contributes linearly. In reality, some sources may exhibit nonlinear behaviors, which can compromise the accuracy of source apportionment. This study introduces a Lung Performance Optimization-based XGBoost (LPO-XGBoost) model, which leverages adaptive optimization principles inspired by lung function to enhance classic PM source apportionment. We demonstrate the potential for efficient, real-time application of the LPO-XGBoost model across 21 monitoring sites in 6 European countries. Trained and validated on extensive environmental datasets, the model is capable of predicting major pollution sources, including road traffic, biomass burning, crustal, industrial, nitrate-rich particles, sulfate-rich particles, heavy fuel oil, and sea salt. It outperforms other machine learning models with an overall predictive coefficient of determination (r2 = 0.88). Notably, the model performs exceptionally well in predicting sources such as sea salt (r2 = 0.97) and biomass burning (r2 = 0.89), but shows lower accuracy for the sulfate-rich particles source (r2 = 0.75). Comparative analyses with models including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and their LPO-enhanced variants confirm that LPO-XGBoost provides the most reliable performance in estimating pollution source contributions, offering scalability and robustness ideal for high-time-resolution observational data. This model has significant potential to support targeted air quality management strategies. Future research should focus on expanding key species measurements at monitoring sites, ensuring consistent temporal coverage, and optimizing the model for improved mixed-source predictions to strengthen its applicability in comprehensive urban air quality assessments. © 2025 The Authors",yes,No,No,Yes
Molecular Insights into Gas−Particle Partitioning and Viscosity of Atmospheric Brown Carbon,"Biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA), containing brown carbon chromophores, plays a critical role in atmospheric chemistry and climate forcing. However, the effects of evaporation on BBOA volatility and viscosity under different environmental conditions remain poorly understood. This study focuses on the molecular characterization of laboratory-generated BBOA proxies from wood pyrolysis emissions. The initial mixture, “pyrolysis oil (PO1)”, was progressively evaporated to produce more concentrated mixtures (PO1.33, PO2, and PO3) with volume reduction factors of 1.33, 2, and 3, respectively. Chemical speciation and volatility were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption combined with direct analysis in real-time ionization and high-resolution mass spectrometry (TPD-DART-HRMS). This novel approach quantified saturation vapor pressures and enthalpies of individual species, enabling the construction of volatility basis set distributions and the quantification of gas−particle partitioning. Viscosity estimates, validated by poke-flow experiments, showed a significant increase with evaporation, slowing particle-phase diffusion and extending equilibration times. These findings suggest that highly viscous tar ball particles in aged biomass burning emissions form as semivolatile components evaporate. The study highlights the importance of evaporation processes in shaping BBOA properties, underscoring the need to incorporate these factors into atmospheric models for better predictions of BBOA aging and its environmental impact. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",no,No,No,No
High resolution source-resolved PM2.5 spatial distribution and human exposure in a large urban area,"Chemical transport models often use moderate spatial resolution to simulate atmospheric pollution, thereby limiting the model's ability to represent variations in urban areas. Additionally, the contributions of individual sources of pollution transported to the urban areas of interest from elsewhere are rarely quantified. In this study, we developed an approach to simulate air quality, focusing on PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter lower than 2.5 μm), and its local and regional sources at high spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km2. The approach is applied in the largest city of Greece, Athens. The PMCAMx chemical transport model is employed in combination with the source apportionment algorithm, PSAT (Particle Source Apportionment Technology), to quantify the concentrations and sources of PM2.5, organic aerosol (OA) and elemental carbon (EC) for a typical summer and winter month. A novel approach is developed, allowing the quantification of the contributions of sources not only inside the simulated urban area but also of the regional sources located outside. Model predictions were combined with population distribution data to provide estimations for human exposure not only to total PM2.5 concentrations but also to specific sources within the city. Residential biomass burning and transportation were found to be the dominant local sources of PM2.5 exposure. The higher resolution (1 × 1 km2) offered a more detailed representation of PM2.5 spatial variability than a coarser one (36 × 36 km2). This underscores the importance of capturing local sources in specific areas of the domain. The proposed approach can be used to provide estimates of human exposure to specific local and regional sources of primary and secondary PM2.5 in an urban area. © 2025 The Authors",yes,No,Yes,Yes
A Comparative Analysis of Satellite-Derived CO Retrievals During the 2020 Wildfires in North America,"In September 2020, the Western United States experienced anomalously severe wildfires that resulted in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions almost three times the 2001–2019 average. In this study, we investigate the influence of wildfires on atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) variability through a comparative analysis of observations from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Our focus is on the North American domain, aiming to understand the differences among these products. In general, all instruments show excellent agreement under typical atmospheric CO conditions. However, notable discrepancies were observed in the CO data from the three sensors, particularly in regions with elevated CO total column (TC) values. IASI and TROPOMI consistently showed higher CO values over the western U.S. compared to MOPITT. During the fire episodes, we found that the IASI retrievals suggested higher CO abundances near the surface than the MOPITT thermal infrared retrievals that are probably the result of the differences in the covariance matrices used in IASI and MOPITT retrievals. We also found that the high IASI and TROPOMI CO observations over the western U.S. coincided with high values of the TROPOMI aerosol index (AI), suggesting the presence of absorbing aerosols. The analysis exhibited better agreement between TROPOMI and MOPITT CO TC when the AI values were low. Our results suggest that appropriate quality filtering should be employed when analyzing pollution events with these data. In particular, utilizing the AI for quality filtering may be useful when analyzing extreme pollution events with these satellite products. © 2024. The Author(s).",no,No,No,No
Unveiling the Drivers of Cloud Condensation Nuclei Activity: Chemical Transformations and Biomass Burning over Rural India,"Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) are the fraction of the aerosol that participate in the formation and modification of clouds. Comprehensive knowledge of CCN is key to understanding aerosol-cloud interactions, and climate change. The ability of aerosols to act as CCN depends on their size and composition. However, various location-specific factors also determine the CCN activity. To investigate this, long-term observations of CCN, along with collocated measurements of aerosols, gases and meteorological parameters, were analyzed from a rural location, Gadanki (13.50N, 79.20E, 375 m AMSL) in India. The results suggest biomass burning activities, represented by high values of BC, and CO, contribute to the highest CCN during March–April. Conversely, chemical transformations involving O3, SO2, NH3, and VOCs, driven by solar radiation, are linked to high CCN levels observed during April as well as daytime (post 10:00 h). The similarity between CCN and small particle concentrations (< 0.5 µm, CN) suggests the dominant role of small particles in CCN activation. Furthermore, a detailed multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis was conducted to quantify the factors influencing CCN. Findings indicate that CCN is infleuenced by a combination of factors rather than a single one, with T, and RH having indirect effects. Although the MLR results support the observed variations in CCN, they exhibit bias due to multicollinearity in the dataset. Therefore, a machine learning-based framework is proposed for future research. Nevertheless, the results emphasize the role of chemical transformations and biomass burning in CCN activity in the rural location, Gadanki. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy Sciences 2025.",yes,No,No,Yes
Comprehensive chemical profile and source apportionment of PM2.5 in Buenos Aires: Insights from the southernmost megalopolis,"Understanding aerosol composition is essential for identifying sources and assessing impacts. We analyzed the chemical profile of 100 24-hour PM2.5 samples and used this data for mass reconstruction and source apportionment. Samples were collected between April 2019 and March 2020 at a site located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 4.2 μg m−3 to 51.4 μg m−3, with a mean of 17.5 μg m−3, and maxima during biomass burning (BB) events. Samples were classified according to the presence or absence of BB events affecting the area, and mass reconstruction was performed. Optimal OM/OC ratios were determined to be 2.5 (BB-samples) and 1.9 (non-BB samples), being OM ∼ 65% and ∼ 54%, respectively. On average, other components accounted for ∼ 14% geological minerals > ∼ 10% inorganic ions > ∼ 6% elemental carbon > ∼ 3% sea salt > ∼ 2% non crustal K. Source contributions were further studied using Positive Matrix Factorization. Open biomass burning was the main contributor to PM2.5 (28.4%) and total carbon (25.7%), highlighting the significance of long-range pollutant transport. The temporal variability of this factor aligns with fire events identified using fire location, back-trajectory analysis, and aerosol classification schemes. The remaining factors found were: SOA + soil + road dust (17.7%), mobile sources powered by low sulfur (15.8%) and high sulfur fuels (11.1%), construction + grills (12.1%), agriculture (9.3%) and thermal power plants + industry (5.6%).

Application of triple-branch artificial neural network system for catalytic pellets combustion,"On the international level, it is common to act on reducing emissions from energy systems. However, in addition to industrial emissions, low-stack emissions also make a significant contribution. A good step in reducing its environmental impact, is to move to biofuels, including biomass. This paper examines the impact of placing a catalytic system in a retort boiler to minimize emissions of greenhouse gases, dust and other pollutants when burning pellets. The effect of platinum, and oxides of selected metals placed on the deflector as a solid catalyst was studied. Based on the experimental data, a branched artificial neural network was constructed and trained. The routing of three parallel topologies made it possible to achieve high accuracy while keeping the input data relatively simple. The system showed an average error of 3.54% against arbitrary test data. On the basis of experimental data as well as predictions returned by the artificial neural network, recommendations were shown for the catalysts used and their amounts. Depending on the biomass from which the pellet was produced, the experiment suggested the use of titanium or copper oxides. In the case of the neural network, it was able to select a better system, based on platinum, improving emission reductions by up to more than 19%, depending on the type of pellet used. © 2024 The Authors",yes,No,Yes,Yes
"Amazon’s climate crossroads: analyzing air pollution and health impacts under machine learning-based temperature increase scenarios in Northern Mato Grosso, Brazil","Air pollution has long been a public health concern in South America, now increasingly linked to climate change. In Brazil, this issue is particularly acute in smaller cities with limited monitoring infrastructure. Sinop, located in the Amazon biome of Mato Grosso, exemplifies the intersection of agricultural expansion and environmental vulnerability. This study presents a comprehensive assessment of meteorological conditions, air pollutant levels, and related health impacts in Sinop, focusing on PM2.5, PM10, and ground-level ozone (O3). Using 2022 data, we applied Health Impact Assessment (HIA) via the WHO’s AirQ + tool and simulated temperature rise scenarios through a machine learning model. ur findings indicate that O3 levels are highly sensitive to meteorological variation, while PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations are projected to increase by up to 50% and 70%, respectively, under extreme warming scenarios. These changes correspond to an estimated increase in non-external mortality of over 90% for PM2.5 and more than 1000% for PM10. Seasonal simulations revealed that the dry season, marked by intense biomass burning, significantly exacerbates pollutant concentrations. These results underscore the growing burden of air pollution on public health in rapidly urbanizing regions. They also highlight the urgent need for enhanced air quality monitoring and climate-adaptive public health strategies in vulnerable areas such as the southern Amazon. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",no,No,No,No
Accountability Assessment of Source-Specific Impacts of Regulations on Emissions and Air Quality Using Positive Matrix Factorization,"Emission controls targeting electric generating units (EGUs) and mobile sources have been implemented for decades to mitigate PM2.5 concentrations. Impacts of emission controls on source-apportioned PM2.5 concentrations (diesel/gasoline vehicles, biomass burning, secondary nitrate, secondary sulfate, soil/road dust, and residual oil estimated via positive matrix factorization) across three U.S. highly urbanized regions─Atlanta, New York City, and the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB)─from 2005 to 2019 were evaluated. We considered major controls on EGUs, mobile sources, ports, and heating fuel. Daily counterfactual source-apportioned PM2.5 concentrations without emission controls were estimated based on meteorological indicators and counterfactual emissions using the generalized additive model. Results indicate that emission controls reduced the PM2.5 concentrations by 65-85% across all regions. Secondary sulfate concentrations without EGU controls would be 4.8 times higher, and diesel-vehicle-related PM2.5 would increase 6.8 times without mobile controls in Atlanta. Secondary inorganic aerosols in New York City would increase 5-fold from 1.92 to 10.5 μg/m3, shifting the dominant PM2.5 contributors. Seasonal trends in the counterfactual PM2.5 concentrations were similar to the actual trends, but the peaks in the counterfactual scenario were clearer than those with emission controls. © 2025 The Authors.

Modeling the Black and Brown Carbon Absorption and Their Radiative Impact: The June 2023 Intense Canadian Boreal Wildfires Case Study,"Black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) are light-absorbing aerosols with significant climate impacts, but their absorption properties and direct radiative effect (DRE) remain uncertain. We simulated BC and BrC absorption during the intense Canadian boreal wildfires in June 2023 using an enhanced version of CHIMERE chemical and transport model. The study focused on a domain extending from North America to Eastern Europe, including the Arctic up to 85°N. The enhanced model includes an update treatment for BC absorption enhancement and a BrC aging scheme accounting for browning and blanching through oxidation. Validation against Aerosol Robotic Network and satellite data showed the model accurately reproduced aerosol optical depth (AOD) at multiple wavelengths, both near wildfire sources and during transoceanic transport to Europe. Improvements were observed in simulations of absorbing AOD (absorbing aerosol optical) compared with the baseline model. Significant enhancements were achieved in capturing the spatial distribution of aerosol absorption in areas affected by wildfire emissions. For June 2023, the regional all-sky DRE attributed to Canadian wildfires was reduced from −2.1 W/m2 in the control model to −1.9 W/m2 in the enhanced model. This corresponded to an additional warming effect of +0.2 W/m2 (+10%) due to the advanced treatment of BC and BrC absorption. These results indicate the importance of accurate aerosol absorption modeling in regional climate predictions, during large-scale biomass burning events. They also highlight potential overestimations of cooling effects in traditional models, emphasizing the need of improved aerosol parameterization to better simulate the DRE and for evaluating the impacts of mitigation strategies. © 2025.

A study on the impact of meteorological and emission factors on PM2.5 concentrations based on machine learning,"PM2.5 pollution, a major environmental and health concern, is influenced by a complex interplay of emission sources and meteorological conditions. Accurately identifying these factors and their contributions is essential for effective pollution management. This study applies Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to identify primary sources of PM2.5 and uses the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) to quantitatively assess the impact of meteorological and emission factors on PM2.5 concentrations. SHAP results reveal that meteorological factors contribute 16.6% (5.3 μg/m3) to PM2.5, with humidity being the most influential, while emission sources account for 83.4% (26.8 μg/m3), with secondary particulate matter being the dominant factor. Secondary particulate matter and biomass burning significantly impacted PM2.5 in the first and fourth quarters, while dust sources became more influential in the second quarter, and coal emissions were most prominent in the second and third quarters. Two-dimensional PDP analysis indicated that in the first and fourth quarters, secondary particulate matter concentration increased with air pressure, and the atmospheric oxidation process was more pronounced under high-humidity conditions during the day. Strong transport conditions, with wind direction shifting from north to east, also influenced secondary particulate matter levels. This study demonstrates that the LightGBM model effectively captures the nonlinear relationships between PM2.5 and meteorological and emission factors, providing a reliable approach for analyzing the causes of PM2.5 pollution. © 2025",yes,No,No,Yes
Hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics on the southern and northern slopes of the Himalayas: spatio-temporal controls and source apportionment,"Water-soluble ions, inorganic nitrogen, and stable isotopes in precipitation were assessed from the southern (Koshi Tappu and Khandbari) and northern slopes (Lhasa and SET) of the Himalayas to understand the sources, chemistry of regional precipitation, and climatic processes. Water soluble ions showed distinct seasonal variation, with higher concentrations in the non-monsoon. The concentration of ionic species was highest in Koshi Tappu, followed by Lhasa, SET, and Khandbari. The sources were from the terrigenous (Ca2+, HCO3−), marine (Na+ and Cl−), anthropogenic (SO42−, NO3−, and NH4+), terrigenous and marine (Mg2+), and biomass-burning (K+). The southern slope, relative to the northern, was more prone to anthropogenic emissions with higher deposition. Among all sites, inorganic nitrogen deposition at Koshi Tappu was higher than the threshold value (10 kg ha−1 y−1). The isotopic composition during the study period was higher in non-monsoon, started declining from June, and depleted in July and August compared to other months, i.e., the monsoon mature phase, along the south-to-north transect. The diminished value of stable isotopes in precipitation with increasing altitude underlines the evidence of the orographic effect in isotopic composition. Our study delineated that the higher/lower d-excess value increased with altitude on the southern/northern slope of the Himalayas. The backward trajectory analysis and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's Final (NCEP FNL) datasets identified that most of the trajectories arrived from warm and humid low-latitude regions during monsoon and westerlies in non-monsoon. Thus, the chemical characteristics and stable isotopic composition of precipitation differed on the southern and northern slopes of the Himalayas by orographic effect and various sources. This study provides new insights into the atmospheric environment and climatic control of stable isotopes in the Himalayan Tibetan Plateau and facilitates monitoring of transboundary air pollution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",no,No,No,No
"Aerosol Forcing from Ground-Based Synergies over a Decade in Barcelona, Spain","This research aims to estimate long-term aerosol radiative effects by combining radiation and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations in Barcelona, Spain. Aerosol Radiative Forcing and Aerosol Forcing Efficiency (ARF and AFE) were estimated by combining shortwave radiation measurements from a SolRad-Net CM-21 pyranometer (level 1.5) and AERONET AOD (level 2), using the direct method. The shortwave AFE was derived from the slope between net solar radiation and AOD at 440, 675, 879, and 1020 nm, and the ARF was computed by multiplying the AFE by AOD at six solar zenith angles (20°, 30°, 40°, 50°, 60°, and 70°). Clear-sky conditions were selected from all-skies days by a quadratic fitting. The aerosol was classified to investigate the forcing contributions from each aerosol type. The aerosol classification was based on Pace and Toledano’s thresholds from AOD vs. Ångström Exponent (AE). The GRASP inversions were performed by combined AOD, radiation, Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) by zenith angles from the polarized sun–sky–lunar photometer and the elastic signal from the UPC-ACTRIS lidar system. The long-term AFE and ARF are both negative, with an increasing tendency (in absolute value) of +24% (AFE) and +40% (ARF) in 14 years. The yearly AFE varied from −331 to −10 Wm−2τ−1, and the ARF varied from −64 to −2 Wm−2, associated with an AOD (440 nm) from 0.016 to 0.690. The three types of aerosols on clear-sky days are mixed aerosols (61%), desert dust (10%), and urban/industrial-biomass burning aerosols (29%). Combined with Gobbi’s method, this classification clustered the aerosols into four groups by AE analysis (two coarse- and two fine-mode aerosols). Then, the contribution of the aerosol types to the ARF showed that the desert dust forcing had the largest cooling effect in Barcelona (−61.5 to −37.4 Wm−2), followed by urban/industrial-biomass burning aerosols (−40.4 to −20.4 Wm−2) and mixed aerosols (−31.8 and −24.0 Wm−2). Regarding the comparison among Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) inversions, AERONET inversions, and direct method estimations, the AFE and ARF had some differences owing to their definitions in the algorithms. The DoLP, used as GRASP input, decreased the ARF overestimation for high AOD. © 2025 by the authors.",yes,No,No,Yes
How long does carbon stay in a near-pristine central Amazon forest? An empirical estimate with radiocarbon,"Amazon forests play a significant role in the global C cycle by assimilating large amounts of CO2 through photosynthesis and by storing C largely as biomass and soil organic matter. To evaluate the net budget of C in the Amazon, we must also consider the amplitude and timing of losses of C back to the atmosphere through respiration and biomass burning. One useful timescale metric that integrates such information in terrestrial ecosystems is the transit time of C, defined as the time elapsed between C entering and leaving the ecosystem; the transit time is equivalent to the age of C exiting the ecosystem, which occurs mostly through respiration. We estimated the mean transit time of C for a central Amazon forest based on the C age during ecosystem respiration (ER), taking advantage of the large variations in CO2 in the atmosphere below the forest canopy to estimate the radiocarbon signature of mean ER (Δ14CER) using Keeling and Miller-Tans mixing models. We collected air samples to evaluate changes in the isotopic signature of the main ER sources by estimating the δ13CER. We collected air samples in vertical profiles in October 2019 and December 2021 at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) in the central Amazon. Air samples were collected in a diel cycle from two heights below the canopy (4 and 24 m above ground level (a.g.l.)). Afternoon above-canopy samples (79 and 321 m a.g.l.) were collected as the background. For the campaign of October 2019, the mean Δ14CER ranged from 24% to 41% with both Keeling and Miller-Tans methods. In December 2021, mean Δ14CER ranged from 53% to 102%. The δ13CER showed a smaller variation, being -27.8% ± 0.3% in October 2019 and -29.0% ± 0.5% in December 2021. The Δ14CER estimates were compared with the record of atmospheric radiocarbon from the bomb period, providing estimates of mean transit time of 6 ± 2 years for 2019 and 18 ± 4 years for 2021. In contrast to steady-state carbon balance models that predict constant mean transit times, these results suggest an important level of variation in mean transit times. We discuss these results in the context of previous model-based estimates of mean transit time for tropical forests and the Amazon region. In addition, we discuss previous studies that indicate that approximately 70 % of assimilated carbon is respired as autotrophic respiration in the central Amazon. Our results suggest that newly fixed carbon in this terra firme tropical forest is respired within 1 to 2 decades, implying that only a fraction of assimilated C can act as a sink for decades or longer.  © Copyright: 2025 Ingrid Chanca et al.",no,No,No,No
Chemical Differences between Phenolic Secondary Organic Aerosol Formed through Gas-Phase and Aqueous-Phase Reactions,"Phenolic compounds, which are significant emissions from biomass burning (BB), undergo rapid photochemical reactions in both gas and aqueous phases to form secondary organic aerosol, namely, gasSOA and aqSOA, respectively. The formation of gasSOA and aqSOA involves different reaction mechanisms, leading to different product distributions. In this study, we investigate the gaseous and aqueous reactions of guaiacol─a representative BB phenol─to elucidate the compositional differences between phenolic aqSOA and gasSOA. Aqueous-phase reactions of guaiacol produce higher SOA yields than gas-phase reactions (e.g., roughly 60 vs 30% at one half-life of guaiacol). These aqueous reactions involve more complex reaction mechanisms and exhibit a more gradual SOA evolution than their gaseous counterparts. Initially, gasSOA forms with high oxidation levels (O/C > 0.82), while aqSOA starts with lower O/C (0.55-0.75). However, prolonged aqueous-phase reactions substantially increase the oxidation state of aqSOA, making its bulk chemical composition closer to that of gasSOA. Additionally, aqueous reactions form a greater abundance of oligomers and high-molecular-weight compounds, alongside a more sustained production of carboxylic acids. AMS spectral signatures representative of phenolic gasSOA have been identified, which, together with tracer ions of aqSOA, can aid in the interpretation of field observation data on aerosol aging within BB smoke. The notable chemical differences between phenolic gasSOA and aqSOA highlighted in this study also underscore the importance of accurately representing both pathways in atmospheric models to better predict the aerosol properties and their environmental impacts. © 2024 The Authors.

Modelling health implications of extreme PM2.5 concentrations in Indian sub-continent: Comprehensive review with longitudinal trends and deep learning predictions,"Air pollution poses a critical global challenge, disproportionately impacting public health and the environment in developing nations like India. The review suggests rapid urbanisation, industrialization, and increased energy consumption have worsened air quality, where average annual PM2.5 concentration far exceeds World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines of 5 μg/m3, leading to high mortality and increased disability-adjusted life years. Indoor air pollution from biomass burning exacerbates the issue, affecting millions of populations in India who rely on traditional fuels. Despite strides in air quality monitoring through National Mission on Air Pollution (NMAP), challenges such as uneven data coverage and limited ground stations for entire country, especially in rural areas, and outdated emission standards hamper effective policy implementation. Therefore, this study utilizes MERRA-2 reanalysis and Global Burden of Disease datasets, this study analysed disease-related mortality influenced by pollution extremes [MPM2.5 (Mean Annual Pollution through PM2.5), PM2.5D (Polluted days through PM2.5), MAPM2.5 (Maximum 1-day pollution amount), and PM2.599p (Heavily polluted regions)]. Single and multilinear regression analyses were conducted between pollution extremes and disease-related mortality, followed by a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to predict mortality by disease, state, and gender based on pollution extremes. The study revealed significant spatiotemporal variation in PM2.5 concentrations across India, with northern states exceeding air quality guidelines and PM2.5 levels more than doubling in the Indo-Gangetic Plains between 1980-1990 and 2010–2020. Regression analysis showed correlation between PM2.5 and neurological disorders and chronic respiratory diseases, while respiratory infections and tuberculosis had the weakest correlation. Further a dense CNN model improved predictive accuracy, achieving R2 values between 0.84 and 0.94 across states, diseases, and genders. The study will provide a valuable insight to air quality and health monitoring programme (AQHMP) through suggesting stricter pollution standards, expanded rural monitoring, sector-specific policies, improved emission inventories, and advanced technologies with AI&ML and remote sensing for better data and reduced health risks. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",no,No,No,No
Machine learning-based quantification and separation of emissions and meteorological effects on PM2.5 in Greater Bangkok,"This study presents the first-ever application of machine learning (ML)-based meteorological normalization and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis to quantify, separate, and understand the effect of meteorology on PM2.5 over Greater Bangkok (GBK). Six ML models namely random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (ADB), gradient boosting (GB), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and cat boosting (CB) were used with meteorological factors, fire activity, land use, and socio-economic data as predictor variables. The LGBM outperformed other models achieving ρ = 0.9 (0.95), MBE = 0 (− 0.01), MAE = 5.5 (3.3) μg m−3, and RMSE = 8.7 (4.9) μg m−3 for hourly (daily) PM2.5 prediction. LGBM was used for spatiotemporal PM2.5 estimation, and meteorological normalization was applied to calculate PM2.5_emis (emission-related PM2.5) and PM2.5_met (meteorology-related PM2.5). Diurnal variation reveals higher PM2.5 levels in the morning (08–10 LT) due to increased traffic emissions and thermal inversion and a decrease in PM2.5 as the day progresses due to decreased emission and inversion dissipation. Monthly variation suggests higher PM2.5 in winter (December and January) due to emissions and stagnant meteorological conditions. Negative PM2.5_met during November, March, and April values show meteorology improves air quality, while positive values from December to February indicate stagnant winter conditions worsen it. During winter, PM2.5_emis and PM2.5 showed an increasing trend in 15.6% and 67.8% of the area while decreasing trends fell from 23.2 to 1.9%. In summer, the percentage of areas with an increasing trend rose from 18.7 to 34.6%, and decreasing areas fell from 12.6 to 6.5%. Increase in PM2.5 despite decreasing emission over a larger area, indicating limited effectiveness of mitigation measures. Winter exhibits greater PM2.5 variability due to episodic increases from changing meteorological conditions. In Bangkok and nearby areas, higher variability is mainly driven by meteorology, with more consistent emissions in Bangkok compared to rural areas affected by agricultural burning. PM2.5 and PM2.5_emis showed stronger persistence in winter than in summer, with weaker effects in Bangkok. Hurst exponent averages were 0.75, 0.76, and 0.72 for PM2.5 and 0.79, 0.8, and 0.73 for PM2.5_emis in dry, winter, and summer seasons, respectively. SHAP analysis suggested relative humidity, planetary boundary layer height, v wind, temperature, u wind, global radiation, and aerosol optical depth as the key variables affecting PM2.5 with mean absolute SHAP values of 5.29, 4.79, 4.29, 3.68, 2.37, 2.22, and 2.03, respectively. Based on these findings, some policy recommendations have been proposed. © The Author(s) 2025.",no,No,No,No
Evidence for cytotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction in human lung cells exposed to biomass burning aerosol constituents: Levoglucosan and 4-nitrocatechol,"Biomass burning (BB) emissions are one of the largest sources of carbonaceous aerosol, posing a significant risk as an airway irritant. Important BB markers include wood pyrolysis emissions, such as levoglucosan (LG) that is an anhydrous sugar bearing a six-carbon ring structure (i.e., 1,6-anhydro-β-D-glucopyranose). Atmospheric chemical aging of BB-derived aerosol (BBA) in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx) can yield nitro-aromatic compounds, including 4-nitrocatechol (4NC). There is building evidence that NOx-mediated chemical aging of BBA poses a more serious exposure effect than primary pyrolysis emissions. This study provides a comparative toxicological assessment following the exposure to important BBA marker compounds in human lung cells (i.e., A549 and BEAS-2B) to determine whether aromatic 4NC is more toxic than BBA-bound anhydrous carbohydrate (i.e., LG). We determined inhibitory concentration-50 (IC50) and examined reactive oxygen species (ROS) changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis induction in the two cell lines following exposure to LG and 4NC in a dose-response manner. In the BEAS-2B cells, estimated IC50 values for 4NC were 33 and 8.8 μg mL−1, and for LG were 2546 and ∼3 × 107 μg mL−1 at 24 h and 48 h of exposure, respectively. A549 cells exhibited a much higher IC50 value than BEAS-2B cells. LG exposures resulted in mitochondrial stress with viability inhibition, but cells recovered with increasing exposure time. 4NC exposures at 200 μg mL−1 resulted in the induction of apoptosis at 6 h. Mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS imbalance induced the intrinsic apoptotic pathway induction following 4NC exposures. While increased ROS is caused by LG exposure in lung cells, 4NC is a marker of concern during BB emissions, as we observed apoptosis and high mitochondrial ROS in both lung cells at atmospherically-relevant aerosol concentrations. It may be associated with higher airway or inhalation pathologies in higher BBA emissions, such as wildfires or during wood combustion. © 2024 The Authors",no,No,No,No
Applying Deep Learning for Wildfire Identification: Economical and Accessible Solutions Leveraging Small Datasets,"Wildfires significantly impact human health, air quality, visibility, weather, and climate change and cause substantial economic losses. While state and county-operated air quality monitors provide critical insights during wildfires, they are not available in all regions. This highlights the need for affordable, accessible tools that allow the general public to assess air quality impacts. In this study, we apply machine learning with deep neural networks to diagnose air quality rapidly from sky images taken at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, WA, USA. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework, we trained a deep learning model to classify air quality indices based on sky images. By leveraging transfer learning, our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained model on a small dataset of sky images, significantly reducing training time while maintaining high accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning to provide rapid air quality diagnostics during wildfire episodes, offering early warnings to the public and enabling timely mitigation strategies, particularly for vulnerable populations. Additionally, we show that lower respiratory infections pose the highest health risk during acute smoke exposures. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) from wildfire particles further exacerbate health risks by triggering inflammation and other adverse effects. © 2025 by the authors.",no,No,No,No
"Assessing the Impact of Straw Burning on PM2.5 Using Explainable Machine Learning: A Case Study in Heilongjiang Province, China","Straw burning is recognized as a significant contributor to deteriorating air quality, but its specific impacts, particularly on PM2.5 concentrations, are still not fully understood or quantified. In this study, we conducted a detailed examination of the spatial and temporal patterns of straw burning in Heilongjiang Province, China—a key agricultural area—utilizing high-resolution fire-point data from the Fengyun-3 satellite. We subsequently employed random forest (RF) models alongside Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAPs) to systematically evaluate the impact of various determinants, including straw burning (as indicated by crop fire-point data), meteorological conditions, and aerosol optical depth (AOD), on PM2.5 levels across spatial and temporal dimensions. Our findings indicated a statistically nonsignificant downward trend in the number of crop fires in Heilongjiang Province from 2015 to 2023, with hotspots mainly concentrated in the western and southern parts of the province. On a monthly scale, straw burning was primarily observed from February to April and October to November—which are critical periods in the agricultural calendar—accounting for 97% of the annual fire counts. The RF models achieved excellent performance in predicting PM2.5 levels, with R2 values of 0.997 for temporal and 0.746 for spatial predictions. The SHAP analysis revealed the number of fire points to be the key determinant of temporal PM2.5 variations during straw-burning periods, explaining 72% of the variance. However, the significance was markedly reduced in the spatial analysis. This study leveraged machine learning and interpretable modeling techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of straw burning on PM2.5 levels, both temporally and spatially. The detailed analysis offers valuable insights for policymakers to formulate more targeted and effective strategies to combat air pollution. © 2024 by the authors.",yes,No,No,Yes
Higher absorption enhancement of black carbon in summer shown by 2-year measurements at the high-altitude mountain site of Pic du Midi Observatory in the French Pyrenees,"Black-carbon-containing particles strongly absorb light, causing substantial radiative heating of the atmosphere. The climate-relevant properties of black carbon (BC) are poorly constrained in high-altitude mountain regions, where many complex interactions between BC, radiation, clouds and snow have important climate implications. This study presents 2-year measurements of BC microphysical and optical properties at the Pic du Midi (PDM) research station, a high-altitude observatory located at 2877m above sea level in the French Pyrenees. Among the long-term monitoring sites in the world, PDM is subject to limited influence from the planetary boundary layer (PBL), making it a suitable site for characterizing the BC in the free troposphere (FT). The classification of the dominant aerosol type using aerosol spectral optical properties indicates that BC is the predominant aerosol absorption component at PDM and controls the variation in single-scattering albedo (SSA) throughout the 2 years. Single-particle soot photometer (SP2) measurements of refractory BC (rBC) show a mean mass concentration (MrBC) of 35ngm-3 and a relatively constant rBC core mass-equivalent diameter of about 180nm, which are typical values for remote mountain sites. Combining the MrBC with in situ absorption measurements, a rBC mass absorption cross-section (MACrBC) of 9.2±3.7m2g-1 at λCombining double low line880nm has been obtained, which corresponds to an absorption enhancement (Eabs) of 1/42.2 compared to that of bare rBC particles with equal rBC core size distribution. A significant reduction in the ""MrBC/ ""CO ratio when precipitation occurred along the air mass transport suggests wet removal of rBC. However we found that the wet removal process did not affect the rBC size, resulting in unchanged Eabs. We observed a large seasonal contrast in rBC properties with higher MrBC and Eabs in summer than in winter. In winter a high diurnal variability in MrBC (Eabs) with higher (lower) values in the middle of the day was linked to the injection of rBC originating from the PBL. On the contrary, in summer, MrBC showed no diurnal variation despite more frequent PBL conditions, implying that MrBC fluctuations are rather dominated by regional and long-range transport in the FT. Combining the ""MrBC/ ""CO ratio with air mass transport analysis, we observed additional sources from biomass burning in summer leading to an increase in MrBC and Eabs. The diurnal pattern of Eabs in summer was opposite to that observed in winter with maximum values of 1/42.9 observed at midday. We suggest that this daily variation may result from a photochemical process driving the rBC mixing state rather than a change in BC emission sources. Such direct 2-year observations of BC properties provide quantitative constraints for both regional and global climate models and have the potential to close the gap between model-predicted and observed effects of BC on the regional radiation budget and climate. The results demonstrate the complex influence of BC emission sources, transport pathways, atmospheric dynamics and chemical reactivity in driving the light absorption of BC.  © Copyright: ",yes,No,No,Yes
Stubble Burning Effect On Soil’s Dielectric Behavior: An Exploration Of Machine Learning-Based Modelling Approaches,"Stubble burning is a conventional technique of residue management that has affected the physio-chemical properties of the soils. In soil sciences, dielectric properties of soils using radio and microwave-based remote sensing have huge applications. Thus, presented paper has studied the burning effects of stubble on soil’s physical, chemical and dielectric properties ((Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.)). Moreover, the experimentally observed soil’s dielectric data has been explored with various classical Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Network (NN) based regression models. The soil samples were taken from the fields of Punjab, India, in the October-November months following a multistage soil sampling method. Then, Dak-12 open-ended coaxial probe (DOCP) has been used in alliance with a two-port Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) E5071C, Agilent Technologies, to investigate the dielectric properties of soil samples. The obtained results indicate that physio-chemical and dielectric properties have been strongly affected by burning as well as because of the presence of high concentrations of ash residues. (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) variations with depth indicate that ash residues can seep up to depths of 10 cm in a single burning process. Moreover, the continuous burning of stubble can have permanent effects on soil’s properties. Among considered regression models, the Deep NN-based regression model has given the most accurate predictions of the regressor variables (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.), with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.06 and 0.07, respectively. Stubble burning has visible effects on physical, chemical as well as dielectric properties of soil. The burning of stubble damages natural ecosystem and essential nutrients which decrease fertility of soil. Also, the resultant residue ash becomes permanent part of soil profile and alters basic properties of soil. Moreover, exploration of ML-based regression models suggests the tremendous applications of data-centric models in soil and material sciences. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.",yes,No,No,Yes
Stereoscopic height estimation of biomass burning aerosol and volcanic ash plumes by the second-generation global imager (SGLI),"Intense wildfire and volcanic eruption emit a large quantity of aerosol in a form of plume that triggers various social and climatic consequences. Accurate simulation of such explosive emission events and the prediction of their consequences require a knowledge of the plume top height that could be estimated in several different approaches. This paper presents the application of stereoscopic height estimation technique to the data acquired by the Second-generation Global Imager (SGLI) aboard the Global change observation mission - C (GCOM-C) satellite that collected more than 6 years of global wide-swath (1200 km) two-directional measurements. The SGLI captured 5 volcanic plumes among 10 most explosive volcanic eruptions in the 5-year period from 2018 to 2023. Along with an intense wildfire plume, we applied to observed plumes the stereoscopic plume top height estimation based on the normalized cross correlation (NCC) template matching. The estimated plume top height agrees with previous studies in most cases, while estimation was challenging for a volcanic plume case with low contrast and limited plume-top texture. The error estimation shows that the precision is about 700 m and the accuracy is likely better than 1400 m. © 2024 SPIE.",no,No,No,No
Characteristics of secondary inorganic aerosols and contributions to PM2.5 pollution based on machine learning approach in Shandong Province,"Primary emissions of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants, such as SO2 and NOx have decreased in China following the implementation of a series of policies by the Chinese government to address air pollution. However, controlling secondary inorganic aerosol pollution requires attention. This study examined the characteristics of the secondary conversion of nitrate (NO3−) and sulfate (SO42−) in three coastal cities of Shandong Province, namely Binzhou (BZ), Dongying (DY), and Weifang (WF), and an inland city, Jinan (JN), during December 2021. Furthermore, the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP), an interpretable attribution technique, was adopted to accurately calculate the contributions of secondary formations to PM2.5. The nitrogen oxidation rate exhibited a significant dependence on the concentration of O3. High humidity facilitates sulfur oxidation. Compared to BZ, DY, and WF, the secondary conversion of NO3− and SO42− was more intense in JN. The light-gradient boosting model outperformed the random forest and extreme-gradient boosting models, achieving a mean R2 value of 0.92. PM2.5 pollution events in BZ, DY, and WF were primarily attributable to biomass burning, whereas pollution in Jinan was contributed by the secondary formation of NO3− and vehicle emissions.

Source-specific light absorption and radiative effects decreases and indications due to the lockdown,"The ‘extreme’ emission abatement during the lockdown (from the end of 2019 to the early 2020) provided an experimental period to investigate the corresponding source-specific effects of aerosol. In this study, the variations of source-specific light absorption (babs) and direct radiative effect (DRE) were obtained during and after the lockdown period by using the artificial neural network (ANN) and source apportionment environmental receptor model. The results showed that the babs decreased for all sources during the two periods. The most reductions were observed with ∼90% for traffic-related emissions (during the lockdown) and ∼85% for coal combustion (after the lockdown), respectively. Heightened babs (370 nm) values were obtained for coal and biomass burning during the lockdown, which was attributed to the enhanced atmospheric oxidization capacity. Nevertheless, the variations of babs (880 nm) after the lockdown was mainly due to the weakening of oxidation and reduced emissions of secondary precursors. The present study indicated that the large-scale emission reduction can promote both reductions of babs (370 nm) and DRE (34–68%) during the lockdown. The primary emissions decrease (e.g., Traffic emission) may enhance atmosphere oxidation, increase the ultraviolet wavelength light absorption and DRE efficiencies. The source-specific emission reduction may be contributed to various radiation effects, which is beneficial for the adopting of control strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",no,No,No,No
Validation and calibration of aerosol optical depth and classification of aerosol types based on multi-source data over China,"A refined classification of aerosol types is essential to identify and control air pollution sources. This study focused on improving the resolution and accuracy of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and further refining the classification of aerosol types in China. We validated the accuracy of the AOD acquired using the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) by comparing it with that acquired using from the Aeronet Robotic Network (AERONET). We simulated the AOD with high spatial resolution and accuracy based on the extremely randomized trees (ERT), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) models and identified aerosol types based on the Angstrom Exponent (AE) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the calibrated AOD. The results showed that CAMS overestimates AOD (21.4 %) and MERRA2 underestimates AOD (−17.3 %). Among the three machine learning models, the ERT model performed best, with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.825 and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.174. Biomass burning/urban-industrial aerosols dominated China, with the largest contributions to southern, eastern, and central China in spring and summer. Clean continental aerosols contributed the most to southwestern China in fall and winter, whereas desert dust aerosols contributed the most to northwestern and eastern China in spring. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,No,Yes
The Spatial–Temporal Emission of Air Pollutants from Biomass Burning during Haze Episodes in Northern Thailand,"Air pollutants from biomass burning, including forest fires and agricultural trash burning, have contributed significantly to the pollution of the Asian atmosphere. Burned area estimates are variable, making it difficult to measure these emissions. Improving emission quantification of these critical air pollution sources requires refining methods and collecting thorough data. This study estimates air pollutants from biomass burning, including PMs, NOX, SO2, BC, and OC. Machine learning (ML) with the Random Forest (RF) method was used to assess burned areas in Google Earth Engine. Forest emissions were highest in the upper north and peaked in March and April 2019. Air pollutants from agricultural waste residue were found in the lower north, but harvesting seasons made timing less reliable. Biomass burning was compared to the MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Sentinel-5P air pollutants, with all comparisons made by the Pollution Control Department (PCD) Thailand air monitoring stations. Agro-industries, mainly sugar factories, produce air pollutants by burning bagasse as biomass fuel. Meanwhile, the emission inventory of agricultural operations in northern Thailand, including that of agro-industry and forest fires, was found to have a good relationship with the monthly average levels of ambient air pollutants. Overall, the information uncovered in this study is vital for air quality control and mitigation in northern Thailand and elsewhere. © 2024 by the authors.",yes,No,No,Yes
A comparison of atmospheric aerosol absorption properties from the MERRA-2 reanalysis with AERONET,"Our focus is the comparison of atmospheric aerosol absorption properties between the MERRA-2 reanalysis and the inversion product of the surface station network AERONET. We use the available Aerosol Absorption Optical Depth (AAOD) and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) data from both sources during the period 1993–2022, for the globe. The comparison is performed for the whole dataset, but also repeated for different classifications, namely by aerosol types, Köppen climate, and continent. Moreover, we investigate the relationships between these classifications. For these medium and high optical depth cases, the MERRA-2 relative bias for AAOD and SSA is globally −3.7% and −1.4%, but there is a wide differentiation in performance for the different types, climates, and continents. The MERRA-2 SSA frequency distribution is too narrow compared to the AERONET. MERRA-2 strongly overestimates the absorption over N. America and less so over S. America and Europe, while it underestimates it greatly over Oceania. AAOD is underestimated over biomass-burning regions and overestimated over most areas rich in dust. There is evidence that the lack of brown carbon in the aerosol type classification scheme in MERRA-2 hampers its performance. The comparison over Asia dry areas (classified as Köppen climate type B) shows a large underestimation in AAOD, non-existent in other dry (B) climate types. For the relatively few observations over polar (Köppen type E) climates, MERRA-2 gives too absorptive aerosols. With respect to absorption properties, it appears that MERRA-2 would improve its agreement with AERONET by addressing some erroneous aerosol classifications, employing the brown carbon type, and introducing more detail in dry region aerosol sources. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",yes,No,No,Yes
Advancing Energy Recovery from Sugarcane Leaf via Two-Stage Anaerobic Digestion for Hydrogen and Methane Production: Impacts on Greenhouse Gas Mitigation and Sustainable Energy Production,"This study aims to enhance energy recovery from sugarcane leaf (SCL) through two-stage anaerobic digestion (TSAD) for hydrogen and methane production. The influence of hydraulic retention time (HRT) on this process was investigated. Optimal conditions established through batch experiments (5% total solids (TS) (w/v) and rice straw compost inoculum) were applied in semi-continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR-H2 and CSTR-CH4). Remarkably, the highest production rates were achieved with HRTs of 5 days for CSTR-H2 (60.1 mL-H2/L·d) and 25 days for CSTR-CH4 (238.6 mL-CH4/L·d). Microbiological analysis by 16s rRNA sequencing identified Bacillus as predominant in CSTR-H2 followed by Lactobacillus and Clostridium. Utilizing SCL for TSAD could reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2.88 Mt-CO2 eq/year, compared to open-field burning, and mitigate emissions from fossil-fuel-based power plants by 228 kt-CO2 eq/year. This research underscores the potential of TSAD for efficient energy recovery and significant GHG emission reductions. © 2023 by the authors.",no,No,No,No
Morphological classification of fine particles in transmission electron microscopy images by using pre-trained convolution neural networks,"Morphological information on fine particles is essential for understanding their transport behavior in the ambient atmosphere and in the human respiratory system. More than 3000 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of fine particles were collected from ambient atmosphere and directly from various sources, such as diesel and gasoline engine exhaust, biomass burning, coal combustion, and road dust, and were then morphologically categorized into four major classes (spherical, agglomerate, polygonal, and dendrite). Pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models (DenseNet169, InceptionV3, MobileNetV3Small, ResNet50, and VGG16) and traditional machine learning models (decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines) were trained using the classified particles. The fine-tuned CNN model (DenseNet169) having the deepest feature learning exhibited the best performance among the tested models, with an overall classification accuracy of 89% and an average per-class accuracy ranging from 84% to 97%. The reliable classification of thousands of images was performed within several minutes. The agglomerated class was the least misclassified because of its significantly different features from those of the other classes. The critical regions of the particles for classification decisions varied among the pre-trained models. Our results suggest that the pre-trained CNN models would be useful for the rapid morphological classification of a large number of fine particles.

"Linking gas, particulate, and toxic endpoints to air emissions in the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM)","Chemical mechanisms describe the atmospheric transformations of organic and inorganic species and connect air emissions to secondary species such as ozone, fine particles, and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) like formaldehyde. Recent advances in our understanding of several chemical systems and shifts in the drivers of atmospheric chemistry warrant updates to mechanisms used in chemical transport models such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. This work builds on the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism version 2 (RACM2) and develops the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM) version 1.0, which demonstrates a fully coupled representation of chemistry leading to ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) with consideration of HAPs. CRACMMv1.0 includes 178 gas-phase species, 51 particulate species, and 508 reactions spanning gas-phase and heterogeneous pathways. To support estimation of health risks associated with HAPs, nine species in CRACMM cover 50g% of the total cancer and 60g% of the total non-cancer emission-weighted toxicity estimated for primary HAPs from anthropogenic and biomass burning sources in the US, with the coverage of toxicity higher (>g%) when secondary formaldehyde and acrolein are considered. In addition, new mechanism species were added based on the importance of their emissions for the ozone, organic aerosol, or atmospheric burden of total reactive organic carbon (ROC): sesquiterpenes, furans, propylene glycol, alkane-like low-to intermediate-volatility organic compounds (9 species), low-to intermediate-volatility oxygenated species (16 species), intermediate-volatility aromatic hydrocarbons (2 species), and slowly reacting organic carbon. Intermediate-and lower-volatility organic compounds were estimated to increase the coverage of anthropogenic and biomass burning ROC emissions by 40g% compared to current operational mechanisms. Autoxidation, a gas-phase reaction particularly effective in producing SOA, was added for C10 and larger alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, sesquiterpenes, and monoterpene systems including second-generation aldehydes. Integrating the radical and SOA chemistry put additional constraints on both systems and enabled the implementation of previously unconsidered SOA pathways from phenolic and furanone compounds, which were predicted to account for g1/4g30g% of total aromatic hydrocarbon SOA under typical atmospheric conditions. CRACMM organic aerosol species were found to span the atmospherically relevant range of species carbon number, number of oxygens per carbon, and oxidation state with a slight high bias in the number of hydrogens per carbon. In total, 11 new emitted species were implemented as precursors to SOA compared to current CMAQv5.3.3 representations, resulting in a bottom-up prediction of SOA, which is required for accurate source attribution and the design of control strategies. CRACMMv1.0 is available in CMAQv5.4.  © 2023 The Author(s).",yes,No,No,Yes
A machine learning modelling approach to characterize the background pollution in the Western Macedonia region in northwest Greece,"The background PM10 concentration in the Western Macedonia region, a complex terrain area with combined urban and industrial emission sources is investigated in this study. PM10 measurements were collected from a remote agricultural monitoring site situated in the southern part of the region and outside the industrial basin over a 12-year period (2010–2021). The ongoing reduction in lignite production during the last decade resulted in considerable changes in particulate emissions in the area. To take into account the changes in the air quality of the region the whole period was divided into two subperiods of common air pollution characteristics. For each period, Hidden Markov Models clustering was applied to the deseasonalized daily PM10 concentrations and the corresponding diurnal amplitudes to extract groups of similar characteristics (clusters) and define the background pollution. The average background concentration was estimated at 15.9 μg/m3 during the period 2010–2015 followed by a decrease of 3.1 μg/m3 to 12.8 μg/m3 during the second study period (2016–2021). The examination of the long-term changes in the background concentration revealed a statistically significant decreasing annual trend of −0.39 μg/m3 that reflected the air quality improvement of the region during the last decade. Additionally, background concentrations co-existed with favorable meteorological conditions such as higher wind speeds during the cold period (October–March) diminishing the contribution of local anthropogenic emissions (biomass burning for heating purposes) and a less developed mixing layer during the warm period (April–September) impeding the impact of the particulate plumes from the nearby power plants. © 2023 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",yes,No,No,Yes
Biomass Burning Greatly Enhances the Concentration of Fine Carbonaceous Aerosols at an Urban Area in Upper Northern Thailand: Evidence From the Radiocarbon-Based Source Apportionment on Size-Resolved Aerosols,"To study the role of biomass burning (BB) in air pollution at upper-northern Thailand, the source apportionment of size-resolved carbonaceous aerosols from Chiang Mai was carried out based on the radiocarbon (14C) analysis. The fraction of modern carbon (F14C) was generally decreased with particle size increasing and with the highest and lowest values of 0.90 ± 0.04 and 0.61 ± 0.04, respectively. Elemental carbon, regardless of emission sources, and BB-derived organic carbon (OCbb) showed unimodal size distribution patterns with peaks at 0.43–0.65 μm. Fossil-fuel derived-OC (OCf) displayed a bimodal mode with the major peak at 2.1–10 μm, and the minor one at 0.43–0.65 μm. The biogenic secondary organic aerosols (BSOA) showed a typical fine-mode unimodal size distribution pattern during the high BB (HBB) season, and a bimodal mode during the low BB season. The BSOA concentration increased by 189% ± 80% due to the interaction with open BB plums during HBB season, which was quantified by a 14C-involved random forest model. Besides, the concentration of biogenic primary organic aerosols also showed a significant increment during the HBB season, especially in sub-microns. Our results highlight the critical importance of controlling open fires to reduce air pollutants and the potential exposure risk. © 2024. American Geophysical Union.

"A study on optical properties, classification, and transport of aerosols during the smog period over South Asia using remote sensing","Over the past few years, South Asian region has experienced frequent and thick smog events because of rapid population growth and enhanced anthropogenic activities, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). Therefore, the present study investigates aerosol properties such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) (500 nm), Angstrom exponent (AE) (440–870 nm), single scattering albedo (SSA), fine-mode fraction (FMF), absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD), and absorption aerosol exponent (AAE) over selected AERONET sites namely Bhola (2012–2021), Dhaka (2012–2021), Jaipur (2011–2021), Kanpur (2011–2021), Karachi (2011–2021), Lahore (2011–2021), and Pokhara (2011–2021) in the IGP during the smog period (October, November, and December). Additionally, different aerosol types were categorized using AERONET direct sun (AOD, AE) and inversion products (VSD, SSA, RI, FMF, and ASY). The monthly mean AOD, AE, and FMF varied from ⁓0.33 to 1.07, ⁓0.3 to 1.4, and 0.6–0.9 µm over all selected AERONET sites during the smog period. Moreover, the outcomes revealed the dominance of biomass-burning and urban/ industrial aerosols over Lahore, Karachi, Dhaka, and Bhola during the smog period. Contrary to this, dust and mixed aerosols were abundant over Jaipur and Karachi, respectively. Furthermore, HYSPLIT cluster analysis is used to trace the transmission paths and potential sources of aerosols over selected sites. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",no,No,No,No
Predicting PM2.5 Concentrations in Bengaluru Using Ensemble Machine Learning Models and Explainable AI Techniques,"Particulate matter PM2.5, originating from various anthropogenic and natural sources such as vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and biomass burning, is a major component of air pollution. They are extremely dangerous for health and can easily penetrate the lungs, consequently impairing lung functions. The adverse effect of PM2.5 can lead to adverse lung infections. This study aims to predict the PM2.5 concentrations using Bangalore's air quality monitoring station using diverse machine learning models. Data from the monitoring station is utilised to train and compare various algorithms like KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, etc. Factors like meteorological data, traffic density, and past pollution levels are considered as features for prediction. Performance metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE and R-squared are used to evaluate model efficiency and accuracy. The best-performing models are chosen for an ensemble approach. Moreover, various hyperparameter tuning techniques are assessed for the Random Forest Regressor, and Explainable AI methods like LIME and SHAP are used to interpret the results. The study yields optimal parameters and impressive findings with ensemble models. These findings highlight the significance of ensemble models and hyperparameter tuning in machine learning.  © 2024 IEEE.",no,No,No,No
Exploring the association between long-term MODIS aerosol and air pollutants data across the Northern Great Plains through machine learning analysis,"Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångström exponent (AE) are the major environmental indicators to perceive air quality and the impact of aerosol on climate change and health as well as the global atmospheric conditions. In the present study, an average of AOD and AE data from Tera and Aqua satellites of MODIS sensors has been investigated over 7 years i.e., from 2016 to 2022, at four locations over Northern Great Plains. Both temporal and seasonal variations over the study periods have been investigated to understand the behavior of AOD and AE. Over the years, the highest AOD and AE were observed in winter season, varying from 0.75 to 1.17 and 1.30 to 1.63, respectively. During pre-monsoon season, increasing trend of AOD varying from 0.65 to 0.95 was observed from upper (New Delhi) to lower (Kolkata) Gangetic plain, however, during monsoon and post-monsoon a reverse trend varying from 0.85 to 0.65 has been observed. Seasonal and temporal aerosol characteristics have also been analyzed and it has been assessed that biomass burning was found to be the major contributor, followed by desert dust at all the locations except in Lucknow, where the second largest contributor was dust instead of desert dust. During season-wise analysis, biomass burning was also found to be as the major contributor at all the places in all the seasons except New Delhi and Lucknow, where dust was the major contributor during pre-monsoon. A boosting regression algorithm was done using machine learning to explore the relative influence of different atmospheric parameters and pollutants with PM2.5. Water vapor was assessed to have the maximum relative influence i.e., 51.66 % followed by CO (21.81 %). This study aims to help policy makers and decision makers better understand the correlation between different atmospheric components and pollutants and the contribution of different types of aerosols. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,Yes,Yes
Analysis of aerosol characteristics in the North Yellow Sea based on the calibration and validation field network of autonomous ocean satellites,"Satellite remote sensing observations and on-site observations on offshore platforms are currently the two most mainstream means of observing characteristics of marine aerosols. Among them, satellite remote sensing observations have the advantage of a wide range of observations, while on-site observations on offshore platforms can obtain observation data with higher time resolution, and have the advantages of easy calibration and maintenance, and high-quality observation data. By using the measured aerosol optical thickness data from the Calibration Validation Field Network of Autonomous Ocean Satellites in the North Yellow Sea, the main aerosol types and optical properties of the offshore station are discussed to provide theoretical and technical support for the calibration and validation of autonomous ocean satellites, as well as the commercial operation of autonomous calibration and validation field networks. Using data from January 2020-June 2023, the data were classified into six main aerosol types according to the graphical classification: clean, desert dust, continental, subcontinental, urban industrial and biomass burning aerosols, and the main aerosol particles at the stations were analyzed by the ESI, single scattering albedo and fine mode fraction. The results show that spring is the most polluted season among the four seasons in the area, continental-type aerosols dominate throughout the year, and the main aerosol type at the station is a continental type aerosol with weak and moderate absorption coarse particle mode. © 2024 SPIE.",yes,No,No,Yes
Assessing emission-driven changes in health risk of source-specific PM2.5-bound heavy metals by adjusting meteorological covariates,"Heavy metals (HMs) in PM2.5 gain much attention for their toxicity and carcinogenic risk. This study evaluates the health risks of PM2.5-bound HMs, focusing on how meteorological conditions affect these risks against the backdrop of PM2.5 reduction trends in China. By applying a receptor model with a meteorological normalization technique, followed by health risk assessment, this work reveals emission-driven changes in health risk of source-specific HMs in the outskirt of Tianjin during the implementation of China’ second Clean Air Action (2018–2020). Sources of PM2.5-bound HMs were identified, with significant contributions from vehicular emissions (on average, 33.4 %), coal combustion (26.3 %), biomass burning (14.1 %), dust (11.7 %), industrial boilers (9.7 %), and shipping emission and sea salt (4.7 %). The source-specific emission-driven health risk can be enlarged or dwarfed by the changing meteorological conditions over time, demonstrating that the actual risks from these source emissions for a given time period may be higher or smaller than those estimated by traditional assessments. Meteorology contributed on average 56.1 % to the interannual changes in source-specific carcinogenic risk of HMs from 2018 to 2019, and 5.6 % from 2019 to 2020. For the source-specific noncarcinogenic risk changes, the contributions were 38.3 % and 46.4 % for the respective periods. Meteorology exerts a more profound impact on daily risk (short-term trends) than on annual risk (long-term trends). Such meteorological impacts differ among emission sources in both sign and magnitude. Reduced health risks of HMs were largely from targeted regulatory measures on sources. Therefore, the meteorological covariates should be considered to better evaluate the health benefits attributable to pollution control measures in health risk assessment frameworks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,No,Yes
Estimating annual GHG and particulate matter emissions from rural and forest fires based on an integrated modelling approach,"Rural and forest fires represent one of the most significant sources of emissions in the atmosphere of trace gases and aerosol particles, which significantly impact carbon budget, air quality, and human health. This paper aims to illustrate an integrated modelling approach combining spatial and non-spatial inputs to provide and enhance the estimation of GHG and particulate matter emissions from surface fires using Italy as a case study over the period 2007–2017. Three main improvements characterize the approach proposed in this work: (i) the collection and development of comprehensive and accurate data inputs related to burned area; (ii) the use of the most recent data on fuel type and load; and (iii) the modelling application to estimate fuel moisture, burning efficiency, and fuel consumption considering meteorological factors and combustion phases. On average, Italy's GHG and particulate matter emissions were 2621 Gg yr−1, ranging from a minimum of 772 Gg yr−1 in 2013 to a maximum of 7020 Gg yr−1 in 2007. Emissions from fire disturbances in broadleaf forests, shrublands, and agricultural fuel types account for about 76 % of the total. Results were compared with global and national inventories and showed good agreement, especially considering CO2 and particulate matter. The approach of this study added confidence in emission estimates, and the results can be utilized in decision support systems to address air quality management and fire impact mitigation policies. © 2023 The Authors",no,No,No,No
"Remote sensing of nighttime air quality over the megacity of Lahore, Pakistan","In recent years, air quality is deteriorating which causes severe impacts on the climate system, and human health, particularly in the mega-cities of Pakistan. As we enter an era of more health related issues, poor air quality and rapid climate change, therefore the implications for nighttime air quality need to be better understood for air quality improvement. In this paper, for the first time, the nighttime air quality of Lahore was assessed using data from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) over Lahore during the period April 2021–August 2022. The highest mean monthly Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Water Vapour Content (WVC) of 1.29 and 5.3 cm were observed in July 2022, respectively, whereas the highest Angstrom Exponent (AE) value of 1.5 occurred in August 2022. Moreover, the nighttime aerosol classification using the association between AOD and AE reveals the dominance of Background Conditions (BC), Urban Industrial/Biomass Burning aerosols (UI/BB), Desert Dust (DD) and Mixed Type (MT) aerosols. Over a couple of previous years, Lahore has witnessed worse air quality mainly due to biomass burning, dust aerosols, industrial pollutants and fuel combustion. Therefore, our main focus was on DD and UI/BB aerosols along with their source regions. We have also used the HYSPLIT model to understand the transport of nighttime aerosols. Moreover, nighttime high concentrations of mean monthly Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Ozone (O3) were observed in March and May 2022, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,No,Yes
Rapid Classification of Aerosol Particle Mass Spectra Using Data Augmentation and Deep Learning,"The concentration and chemical composition of airborne aerosol particles are important indicators of air quality and sources of air pollution. The particles' chemical composition reveals probable emission sources, like traffic, biomass burning, wildfires, agriculture, or industrial sources. Single-particle mass spectrometry (SPMS), combined with rapid spectral classification, uniquely enables an in-situ analysis of the chemical composition of individual aerosol particles in real-time for environmental monitoring and other tasks. Modern SPMS devices analyze hundreds of individual particles per minute. Rapid and accurate classification of such large amounts of data remains challenging. Conventional clustering algorithms require tedious manual post-processing. A mass spectrum can be understood as a 1D image per analyzed particle. We applied CNN-based algorithms to perform a fully automated classification. To train the models, usually a large amount of labeled data needs to be prepared. With a manually created benchmark dataset containing 10,400 samples in 13 classes of emission sources (800 samples per class) we achieved an accuracy of ~90%. If the models are trained using only 100 labeled samples per class (1/8 labeled data), the models' accuracy drops significantly to ~75%. We explored suitable augmentation methods to improve the reliability and performance of multi-class classification for aerosol particle mass spectra in case of limited labeled data (1/8 labeled data). The results using the augmented data improved from ~75% to 86.8%. This paves the way to sharply reduce the expensive and time-consuming work of expert labeling. Furthermore, we verified that converting the 1D mass spectrum into 2D representations and classifying them using 2D-CNN is more efficient than 1D-CNN networks, whether with or without data augmentation. © 2024 IEEE.",yes,No,No,Yes
Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) UV aerosol index data analysis over the Arctic region for future data assimilation and climate forcing applications,"Due to a lack of high-latitude ground-based and satellite-based data from traditional passive- and active-based measurements, the impact of aerosol particles on the Arctic region is one of the least understood factors contributing to recent Arctic sea ice changes. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using the ultraviolet (UV) aerosol index (AI) parameter from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), a semi-quantitative aerosol parameter, for quantifying spatiotemporal changes in UV-absorbing aerosols over the Arctic region. We found that OMI AI data are affected by an additional row anomaly that is unflagged by the OMI quality control flag and are systematically biased as functions of observing conditions, such as azimuth angle, and certain surface types over the Arctic region, resulting in an anomalous ""ring""of climatologically high AI centered at about 70°N, surrounding an area of low AI over the pole. Two methods were developed in this study for quality-assuring the Arctic AI data. Using quality-controlled OMI AI data from 2005 through 2020, we found decreases in UV-absorbing aerosols in the spring months (April and May) over much of the Arctic region and increases in UV-absorbing aerosols in the summer months (June, July, and August) over northern Russia and northern Canada. Additionally, we found significant increases in the frequency and size of UV-absorbing aerosol events across the Arctic and high-Arctic (north of 80°N) regions for the latter half of the study period (2014-2020), driven primarily by a significant increase in boreal biomass-burning plume coverage.  © Copyright: ",yes,No,Yes,Yes
Intricate behavior of winter pollution in Hanoi over the 2006–2020 semi-climatic period,"During the winter period (October to March), air quality in northern Vietnam is strongly impacted by the northeast monsoon cycles, that create periodic changes in the air masses pathways and the meteorological conditions. In this work, an original approach is proposed to identify the main sources contributing to the degradation of air quality in Hanoi and quantify the share of local and imported pollution under the influence of the northeast monsoon. Firstly, semi-climatic trends in particle emissions in East Asia and mainland Southeast Asia were studied using outputs from the NAAPS model, that assimilates space-borne Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations. From winter 2006/07 to winter 2010/11, the pollution plumes were most frequently located over the Indochina Peninsula, and the smoke partial AOD showed biomass burning activities (natural and anthropogenic) to be responsible. From winter 2011/12 to winter 2019/20 however, the pollution plumes were mostly observed over eastern China and to a lesser extent, Northern Vietnam, and the sulfate partial AOD indicated they came from coal-based industrial activities. Secondly, the impact of the northeast monsoon on the air masses origin was studied using HYSPLIT back-trajectories with clustering over the 14 winter periods. During regular winters, northeastern air masses predominated, which can bring pollution from eastern China and the industrial region surrounding Hanoi (Red River Delta). However, the existence of El Niño perturbed the air masses trajectories during three winters (2014/15, 2015/16 and 2018/19), bringing more western air masses and thus, causing a temporary decrease of the sulfate AOD and simultaneous increase of the smoke AOD over Hanoi. Thirdly, a method to classify the winter days and highlight the influence of cold surges on PM2.5 variability was built, relying only on Hanoi local wind and NAAPS AOD value. This classification allowed to estimate that long-range transport from China during the onset of cold surges caused an average increase of around 30% of the PM2.5 level in Hanoi. Additionally, the contribution of local pollution to the most severe pollution episodes, occurring during the persistence of cold surges, was estimated to be around 40% of the average PM2.5. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",yes,No,No,Yes
Application of multiplatform remote sensing data over East Asia Ocean: aerosol characteristics and aerosol types,"It is important to explore the characteristics and rules of atmospheric aerosol in the East Asian Sea for monitoring and evaluating atmospheric environmental quality. Based on Aerosol Robot Network (AERONET), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS), and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data, the temporal and spatial variation characteristics and differences of aerosol parameters and types in the East Asian Sea were studied by using figure classification method (FIGCM), aerosol optical depth (AOD)440-Angstrom exponent (AE)440–870 method (AA1M), and AOD550-AE490-670 method (AA2M). The results show that the seasonal variation trend of aerosol characteristics and types is obvious in East Asia Sea. AOD, volume concentration (Cv), and aerosol effective radius (reff) in the Bohai-Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan in autumn are lower than those in other seasons, and the occurrence frequency of ocean-type aerosols is high. Different from the Bohai-Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan, human activities in winter, summer, and autumn seriously affect the air quality in the East China Sea and South China Sea. Especially at the Taipei CWB site, from aerosol parameters and high biomass burning/urban industrial (BB/UI) aerosol, human activity is an important factor for high pollution at the Taipei CWB site. Aerosol types of AA1M, FIGCM, AA2M, and CALIPSO were compared at Anmyon and Yonsei University sites in the Bohai-Yellow Sea in March 2020. The results show that aerosol types based on threshold classification methods generally have higher mixed aerosol results, and the marine (MA) results of AA1M, FIGCM, and AA2M are close to the clean marine aerosol results of CALIPSO. Comparing the results of AA 2 M and CALIPSO on a spatial scale, it is found that the clean marine aerosol proportion identified by CALIPSO (0.38, 0.48, 0.82) is consistent with the MA proportion identified by AA 2 M (0.43, 0.46, 0.97) in the East China Sea, South China Sea, and Western Pacific Ocean. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",yes,No,No,Yes
Phosphorus Chemistry in Plant Ash: Examining the Variation across Plant Species and Compartments,"Natural terrestrial ecosystems are often phosphorus (P)-limited and rely heavily upon the internal cycling of P in plant litter. Fires thoroughly transform the aboveground P pools by turning litter (and living biomass) into ash and charcoal, changing the forms and fluxes of P entering soil. Therefore, it is important to understand the chemistry and availability of P in the burned residues to predict the impacts of fire on P cycling. This study characterizes the speciation and availability of P in fire ash produced from different plant species and compartments to explore P thermochemistry during biomass burning and geochemical behavior of fire ash. Great variations in P availability (measured by bicarbonate extractable P) were observed for ashes derived from compartments of a range of coniferous and deciduous trees, with labile P ranging from 9 to 78% of total P. Combining sequential extraction and P X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy, we identified the main P species in ash, with apatite being the dominant P species (which contributes to the HCl-extractable P pool). A correlation between elemental stoichiometry and P availability indicates that relative abundances of the main P-complexing cations (i.e., calcium, potassium, and magnesium) affect P chemistry and mobility in ash, while the relationships depend upon plant species and compartments. Results from this study reveal how initial biomass composition (because of different physiological roles of macronutrients in plant compartments) and complete burning affect ash P chemistry and improve our understanding of the disturbance of vegetative fire to ecosystem characteristics and processes. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",no,No,No,No
Aerosol Types Identification over the Arabian Peninsula Using AERONET Products: Evaluation with Multisource Datasets,"Knowing aerosol size and composition is essential for studying aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) and human health impacts, identifying their sources, and improving satellite aerosol estimation methods. An aerosol classification technique (T1) is proposed here using K-mean clustering analysis based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD500 nm) vs Angstrom Exponent (AE440–870 nm) data (1999–2018) from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) in the Arabian Peninsula. The proposed classified aerosol types are: (1) Clean background/clean maritime (CB/CM): AOD < 0.20 & AE < 1.35; (2) Clean Continental (CC): AOD < 0.20 & AE > 1.35; (3) Desert Dust (DD): AOD > 0.20 & AE < 0.6; (4) Dusty Mixture (DM): AOD > 0.20 & 0.60 < AE < 1.0; (5) Urban Industrial (UI): AOD > 0.20 & 1.0 < AE < 1.35; and (6) Biomass Burning (BB): AOD > 0.20 & AE > 1.35. Further verification of our results was conducted with respect to AERONET depolarization ratio (δ), surface observations (e.g., wind speed, relative humidity, and visibility), and dust RGB products from Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor onboard the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite. The T1 reveals that DD was prevalent at the Solar Village in Riyadh (51%), and the KAUST Campus (47.65%) and Hada-El-Sham (37.39%) in Jeddah. Additionally, urban industrial and biomass burning aerosol types were observed due to an increase in industrial activities and biofuel emissions. The evaluation study showed that other previously published techniques (e.g., T2, T3, and T4) misclassified aerosol types, whereas T1 significantly classified aerosol types. Moreover, back trajectory analysis based on the NOAA HYSPLIT model demonstrated that the predominant DD- and other-aerosols originated and transported from both local and external sources of the Arabian Peninsula. Finally, the study examined ARF from AERONET and SBDART (the Santa Barbara DISTORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) models, which found that scattering radiation at the top and bottom of the atmosphere cooled the atmosphere, while absorbing radiation within the atmosphere heated the atmosphere. As a result of the present study, specific aerosol types are now classified and recognized as well as they may have a direct impact on local and regional climate change and radiation budget over the Arabian Peninsula. © King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",yes,No,No,Yes
Dynamic savanna burning emission factors based on satellite data using a machine learning approach,"Landscape fires, predominantly found in the frequently burning global savannas, are a substantial source of greenhouse gases and aerosols. The impact of these fires on atmospheric composition is partially determined by the chemical breakup of the constituents of the fuel into individual emitted chemical species, which is described by emission factors (EFs). These EFs are known to be dependent on, amongst other things, the type of fuel consumed, the moisture content of the fuel, and the meteorological conditions during the fire, indicating that savanna EFs are temporally and spatially dynamic. Global emission inventories, however, rely on static biome-averaged EFs, which makes them ill-suited for the estimation of regional biomass burning (BB) emissions and for capturing the effects of shifts in fire regimes. In this study we explore the main drivers of EF variability within the savanna biome and assess which geospatial proxies can be used to estimate dynamic EFs for global emission inventories. We made over 4500 bag measurements of CO2, CO, CH4, and N2O EFs using a UAS and also measured fuel parameters and fire-severity proxies during 129 individual fires. The measurements cover a variety of savanna ecosystems under different seasonal conditions sampled over the course of six fire seasons between 2017 and 2022. We complemented our own data with EFs from 85 fires with locations and dates provided in the literature. Based on the locations, dates, and times of the fires we retrieved a variety of fuel, weather, and fire-severity proxies (i.e. possible predictors) using globally available satellite and reanalysis data. We then trained random forest (RF) regressors to estimate EFs for CO2, CO, CH4, and N2O at a spatial resolution of 0.25 and a monthly time step. Using these modelled EFs, we calculated their spatiotemporal impact on BB emission estimates over the 2002-2016 period using the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4 with small fires (GFED4s). We found that the most important field indicators for the EFs of CO2, CO, and CH4 were tree cover density, fuel moisture content, and the grass-to-litter ratio. The grass-to-litter ratio and the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio were important indicators for N2O EFs. RF models using satellite observations performed well for the prediction of EF variability in the measured fires with out-of-sample correlation coefficients between 0.80 and 0.99, reducing the error between measured and modelled EFs by 60%-85% compared to using the static biome average. Using dynamic EFs, total global savanna emission estimates for 2002-2016 were 1.8% higher for CO, while CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions were, respectively, 0.2%, 5%, and 18% lower compared to GFED4s. On a regional scale we found a spatial redistribution compared to GFED4s with higher CO, CH4, and N2O EFs in mesic regions and lower ones in xeric regions. Over the course of the fire season, drying resulted in gradually lower EFs of these species. Relatively speaking, the trend was stronger in open savannas than in woodlands, where towards the end of the fire season they increased again. Contrary to the minor impact on annual average savanna fire emissions, the model predicts localized deviations from static averages of the EFs of CO, CH4, and N2O exceeding 60% under seasonal conditions.  © 2023 Roland Vernooij et al.",yes,No,No,Yes
Key toxic components and sources affecting oxidative potential of atmospheric particulate matter using interpretable machine learning: Insights from fog episodes,"Fog significantly affects the air quality and human health. To investigate the health effects and mechanisms of atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during fog episodes, PM2.5 samples were collected from the coastal suburb of Qingdao during different seasons from 2021 to 2022, with the major chemical composition in PM2.5 analyzed. The oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5 was determined using the dithiothreitol (DTT) method. A positive matrix factorization model was adopted for PM2.5. Interpretable machine learning (IML) was used to reveal and quantify the key components and sources affecting OP. PM2.5 exhibited higher oxidative toxicity during fog episodes. Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), NH4+, K+, and water-soluble Fe positively affected the enhancement of DTTV (volume-based DTT activity) during fog episodes. The IML analysis demonstrated that WSOC and K+ contributed significantly to DTTV, with values of 0.31 ± 0.34 and 0.27 ± 0.22 nmol min−1 m−3, respectively. Regarding the sources, coal combustion and biomass burning contributed significantly to DTTV (0.40 ± 0.38 and 0.39 ± 0.36 nmol min−1 m−3, respectively), indicating the significant influence of combustion-related sources on OP. This study provides new insights into the effects of PM2.5 compositions and sources on OP by applying IML models. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,No,Yes
The role of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) in constraining BrC absorption in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP),"We present here the first measurements of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) including nitrophenols (NPs), nitrocatechols (NCs) and nitrosalicylic acids (NSAs) from the Indian subcontinent and their role in constraining brown carbon (BrC) absorption. NACs at a rural receptor site in the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) (annual average: 185 ± 94 ng m−3) was dominated by NSAs (135 ± 77 ng m−3), followed by NPs (29 ± 11 ng m−3) and NCs (17 ± 16 ng m−3), with notable enrichments during nighttime and during the biomass burning seasons. An equilibrium absorption partitioning model estimated that >90 % of NSAs and NCs were in the particle-phase, suggesting lower degradation rates via oxidation and photolysis potentially due to year-round high relative humidity. While the contribution of NACs to organic aerosol mass was only 0.42 ± 0.23 %, their contribution to BrC absorption in the 300–450 nm range was higher by an order of magnitude (8 ± 4 %), with NCs and NSAs contributing almost equally in the low-visible (400–450 nm) range as at 365 nm. Despite having mass concentrations lower than NPs by factors of ∼2, contribution of NCs to BrC absorption at λ ≥ 400 nm was comparable to that by NPs, indicating the importance of the absorption efficiency of chromophores. The receptor model positive matrix factorization (PMF) quantified three major NAC sources: fossil fuel combustion (49 ± 15 %; annual average), secondary formation (40 ± 12 %), and biomass burning (11 ± 9 %), with variable contributions on seasonal and day-night bases. In summary, the study uncovered the significant role of NACs in constraining BrC absorption in the IGP, which stresses the importance for molecular-level characterization of BrC chromophores. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,No,Yes
Aggregation-induced enhancements in aerosol absorption and scattering across the black-brown continuum,"Global radiative forcing by carbonaceous aerosols is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in current climate models. The radiative impacts of brown carbon (BrC), a type of amorphous organic carbonaceous aerosol formed in biomass burning events, such as wildfires, remains poorly understood. Recently, the aggregation of spheres (monomers) of BrC was observed in wildfire smoke from various parts of the world. Aggregation could alter the optical properties and direct radiative forcing of BrC, yet very little is known about this phenomenon. This study improves upon the spectral optical properties of BrC aggregates observed in past field studies. We are motivated by the framework presented by Saleh et al. (2020) for the optical classification of carbonaceous particles across the black-brown continuum. Here, we simplify Saleh et al.'s BrC categorization into two sub-classes: dark brown carbon (d-BrC) and weakly-absorbing brown carbon (w-BrC). We calculate and compare the mass absorption cross-section (MAC), mass scattering cross-section (MSC), single scattering albedo (SSA), and asymmetry parameter (g) of d-BrC and w-BrC and determine their absorption and scattering enhancements due to aggregation. Polydisperse diffusion-limited cluster-cluster aggregation (p-DLCA) simulations generated 90 aggregates of varying monomer diameters, and discrete dipole approximation (DDA) was used to calculate optical properties of these aggregates at relevant refractive indices, monomer diameters, and incident wavelengths. We find that optical properties of BrC aggregates are more sensitive to the monomer number and mean diameter than to polydispersity. d-BrC has almost twice the MAC of w-BrC at 350 nm, but w-BrC has MSC values almost double that of d-BrC. Both MAC and MSC for both types of aerosol decrease with wavelength. Aggregation enhances optical properties, with smaller size parameters and lower imaginary part of the complex refractive index of aggregates resulting in stronger absorption and scattering. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",no,No,No,No
Machine Learning-Based Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties over Land from the Gaofen-5 Directional Polarimetric Camera Measurements,"Aerosol properties, including aerosol optical depth (AOD), aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD), single scattering albedo (SSA), and fine mode fraction (FMF), are essential in studying aerosol climate effects. Spectral multiangle polarimetry (MAP) has been recognized as a promising technique for comprehensive retrievals of global aerosol optical properties from space. As one of the very few MAP sensors in space, the Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) onboard the GaoFen (GF)-5 satellite has great potential to provide these critical aerosol parameters. However, retrievals of aerosol parameters from DPC, especially SSA and AAOD, still remain limited. This study introduces a machine-learning algorithm using the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model to retrieve AOD, AAOD, SSA, FMF, as well as surface albedo (expressed as the directional hemispherical reflectance, DHR) over land from DPC multiangle reflectances and degree of linear polarization (DOLP), using AERONET aerosol measurements and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) DHR data as the training target. Cross-validation indicates high retrieval accuracy, with correlations exceeding 0.75 for all parameters under sufficient aerosol loading. Notably, the accuracy of SSA retrieval is comparable to that of the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) products, with 73% of the independently retrieved 670-nm SSA falling within the ±0.03 error envelope (EE) when 670-nm AOD is above 0.30. Gridded products also effectively capture the spatial and seasonal variability of aerosol properties worldwide, such as in regions dominated by biomass burning and dust. This study confirms the capability of DPC for aerosol property retrievals, which could serve as an important technique and data source for global aerosol and climate monitoring. 1558-0644  © 2024 IEEE.",yes,No,Yes,No
Impact of Biomass Burning Organic Aerosol Volatility on Smoke Concentrations Downwind of Fires,"Biomass burning particulate matter (BBPM) affects regional air quality and global climate, with impacts expected to continue to grow over the coming years. We show that studies of North American fires have a systematic altitude dependence in measured BBPM normalized excess mixing ratio (NEMR; ΔPM/ΔCO), with airborne and high-altitude studies showing a factor of 2 higher NEMR than ground-based measurements. We report direct airborne measurements of BBPM volatility that partially explain the difference in the BBPM NEMR observed across platforms. We find that when heated to 40-45 °C in an airborne thermal denuder, 19% of lofted smoke PM1 evaporates. Thermal denuder measurements are consistent with evaporation observed when a single smoke plume was sampled across a range of temperatures as the plume descended from 4 to 2 km altitude. We also demonstrate that chemical aging of smoke and differences in PM emission factors can not fully explain the platform-dependent differences. When the measured PM volatility is applied to output from the High Resolution Rapid Refresh Smoke regional model, we predict a lower PM NEMR at the surface compared to the lofted smoke measured by aircraft. These results emphasize the significant role that gas-particle partitioning plays in determining the air quality impacts of wildfire smoke. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",yes,No,Yes,Yes
Seasonal differences in continental outflows and marine emissions of organic aerosols in the East China Sea: Insight from the variation of saccharides,"Water-soluble organic species play an important role in cloud condensation nuclei and cloud formation in marine atmosphere. The present study investigated the influence of continental outflows and marine biogenic emission on organic aerosol in the East China Sea from the perspective of saccharides during a cold season and a warm season in 2019, respectively. Driven by the East Asian continental outflows during the cold season, levoglucosan emitted from biomass burning were the dominant species and were mostly concentrated in fine mode (<2.5 μm). Biogenic species, including primary sugars and sugar alcohols, were the dominant species in warm season, accounting for a high fraction of WSOC with 5.48 ± 3.29%, and were mostly distributed in coarse mode (2.5–10 μm). This trend was consistent with sea salt components (Na+ and Cl−) when air masses originated from oceanic areas, suggesting that marine emissions could be the major sources of saccharides during the warm season. Particularly, a dramatic increase in biogenic saccharides (glucose, sucrose, mannitol and arabitol) was observed when experienced the “Super Typhoon Lekima”. Concentrations of these species were 2 to 5 times higher than that in normal days, illustrating the significant impact of extreme weather events on the emissions of biogenic aerosols in marine area. This study improves the understanding of combined impacts of continental outflows and marine emissions on water-soluble organic species in the East China Sea, again highlighting the important contribution of marine biogenic emissions under extreme weather conditions. © 2023",no,No,No,No
Evaluation and comparison of MODIS aerosol optical depth retrieval algorithms over Brazil,"Brazil experiences significant aerosol loads throughout the year, particularly during the biomass-burning season in the Amazon. Thus, given the importance of aerosols for climate and health, this research aimed to validate and compare Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products over Brazil. This evaluation considers three algorithms that retrieve AOD by using data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor: Dark Target (DT) at 3 and 10 km resolution, Deep Blue (DB), and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC). To validate the satellite data, 17 sunphotometers from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) were utilized. The results show a high correlation (R > 0.9) between the MODIS-AOD products and ground-based data. However, MODIS-AOD products tend to overestimate or underestimate AOD values, depending on the specific AOD value and algorithm evaluated. Additionally, it was observed that the performance of the algorithms is influenced by factors such as land cover type, view geometry, and the spatiotemporal distribution of aerosols. In particular, challenges were encountered when retrieving robust AOD data for Savanna and Urban cover classes. In conclusion, the results indicate that MAIAC and DB algorithms demonstrate greater stability in retrieving AOD values. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when applying these products to map aerosols on specific surfaces, such as urban areas. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",yes,No,Yes,No
Optimizing biogas production: a novel hybrid approach using anaerobic digestion calculator and machine learning techniques on Indian biogas plant,"In low- and middle-income countries, managing municipal solid waste and crop residue burning is a major environmental and public health challenge. Composting and anaerobic digestion technologies are promising solutions for biodegradable organic waste management, particularly in India. However, accurate estimation of biogas yield and economic viability is essential for successful implementation of anaerobic digestion in Indian municipalities, considering regional climatic conditions like psychrophilic and psychotropic climates found in areas like North-east India. The proposed anaerobic digestion calculator provides valuable insights for operators to optimize anaerobic digestion unit performance, monitor seasonal variations in biogas production, and enhance profitability under diverse climatic conditions. It comprises a robust biogas production model and an economic model for revenue and cost evaluation. The calculator caters to the needs of anaerobic digestion units commonly employed in India, considering location-specific factors like energy prices, product values, and government incentives. The predictive models developed using machine learning techniques, including multilayer perceptron, support vector regression, and hybrid models like autoregressive integrated moving average-multilayer perceptron, enable the optimization of biogas production by adjusting key parameters. In summary, the proposed anaerobic digestion calculator and machine learning-based predictive models offer a comprehensive approach for biogas yield estimation, optimization, and economic analysis. This contributes to the efficient, sustainable, and profitable operation of biogas plants, supporting India's transition towards a bio-based smart economy and addressing environmental and public health concerns associated with waste management.

"Development of Spatio-Temporal Land Use Regression Models for Fine Particulate Matter and Wood-Burning Tracers in Temuco, Chile","Biomass burning is common in much of the world, and in some areas, residential wood-burning has increased. However, air pollution resulting from biomass burning is an important public health problem. A sampling campaign was carried out between May 2017 and July 2018 in over 64 sites in four sessions, to develop a spatio-temporal land use regression (LUR) model for fine particulate matter (PM) and wood-burning tracers levoglucosan and soluble potassium (Ksol) in a city heavily impacted by wood-burning. The mean (sd) was 46.5 (37.4) μg m-3 for PM2.5, 0.607 (0.538) μg m-3 for levoglucosan, and 0.635 (0.489) μg m-3 for Ksol. LUR models for PM2.5, levoglucosan, and Ksol had a satisfactory performance (LOSOCV R2), explaining 88.8%, 87.4%, and 87.3% of the total variance, respectively. All models included sociodemographic predictors consistent with the pattern of use of wood-burning in homes. The models were applied to predict concentrations surfaces and to estimate exposures for an epidemiological study. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",yes,No,No,Yes
Machine learning assesses drivers of PM2.5 air pollution trend in the Tibetan Plateau from 2015 to 2022,"The Tibetan Plateau (known as the Earth's Third Pole) has significant impact on climate. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an important air pollutant in this region and has significant impact on health and climate. To mitigate PM2.5 air pollution over China, a series of clean air actions has been implemented. However, interannual trends in particulate air pollution and its response to anthropogenic emissions in the Tibetan Plateau are poorly understood. Here, we applied a random forest (RF) algorithm to quantify drivers of PM2.5 trends in six cities of the Tibetan Plateau from 2015 to 2022. The decreasing trends (−5.31 to −0.73 μg m−3 a−1) in PM2.5 during 2015–2022 were observed in all cities. The RF weather-normalized PM2.5 trends – which were driven by anthropogenic emissions – were −4.19 to −0.56 μg m−3 a−1, resulting in dominant contributions (65 %–83 %) to the observed PM2.5 trends. Relative to 2015, such anthropogenic emission driver was estimated to contribute −27.12 to −3.16 μg m−3 to declines in PM2.5 concentrations in 2022. However, the interannual changes in meteorological conditions only made a small contribution to the trends in PM2.5 concentrations. Potential source analysis suggested biomass burning from local residential sector and/or long-range transports originated from South Asia could significantly promote PM2.5 air pollution in this region. Based on health-risk air quality index (HAQI) assessment, the HAQI value was decreased by 15 %–76 % between 2015 and 2022 in these cities, with significant contributions (47 %–93 %) from anthropogenic emission abatements. Indeed, relative contribution of PM2.5 to the HAQI was decreased from 16 %–30 % to 11 %–18 %, while increasing and significant contribution from ozone was observed, highlighting that further effective mitigation of both PM2.5 and ozone air pollution could obtain more substantial health benefits in the Tibetan Plateau. © 2023",yes,No,No,Yes
"The impacts of regional transport on anthropogenic source contributions of PM2.5 in a basin city, China","PM2.5 pollution events are often happened in urban agglomeration locates in mountain-basin regions due to the complex terra and intensive emissions. Source apportionment is essential for identifying the pollution sources and important for developing local mitigation strategies, however, it is influenced by regional transport. To understand how the regional transport influences the atmospheric environment of a basin, we connected the PM2.5 source contributions estimated by observation-based receptor source apportionment and the regional contributions estimated by a tagging technology in the comprehensive air quality model with extensions (CAMx) via an artificial neural network (ANNs). The result shows that the PM2.5 in Xi'an was from biomass burning, coal combustion, traffic related emissions, mineral dust, industrial emissions, secondary nitrate and sulfate. 48.8 % of the PM2.5 in study period was from Xi'an, then followed by the outside area of Guanzhong basin (28.2 %), Xianyang (14.6 %) and Weinan (5.8 %). Baoji and Tongchuan contributed trivial amount. The sensitivity analysis showed that the transported PM2.5 would lead to divergent results of source contributions at Xi'an. The transported PM2.5 from the outside has great a potential to alter the source contributions implying a large uncertainty of the source apportionment introduced when long-range transported pollutants arrived. It suggests that a full comprehension on the impacts of regional transport can lower the uncertainty of the local PM2.5 source apportionment and reginal collaborative actions can be of great use for pollution mitigation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,No,Yes
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in estuarine sediments as a consequence of the mine tailings remobilization and transport in the Rio Doce basin,"The Fundão dam failure in 2015 severely impaired the economy, the lives of riverine communities, and the aquatic ecosystems of the Rio Doce basin in southeast Brazil. Several contaminants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were transported downstream, deposited in the estuary, and released into the Atlantic Ocean. The high concentration of PAHs in estuarine sediments may pose ecological risks and deleterious effects to benthic organisms, so here we aimed at determining the source and fate of these compounds before and after the tailings’ arrival. The mean concentration of the analyzed Σ16PAHs increased from 34.05 µg kg−1 in the prefailure period to 751.77 µg kg−1 one year after the arrival of the tailing. The classification of the sediment quality changed from low to moderate contamination. Our results suggest that there was PAHs remobilization by mine tailings along the Rio Doce basin. The target analytes exhibited mostly a pyrolytic profile from fossil fuel and biomass burning. In addition to other contaminants deposited in the estuary after the arrival of the tailings, this study revealed that the profile change of PAHs in the estuary region is a consequence of the mud's erosive power.

An investigation of nighttime variability in air quality of Naples (Italy) using wavelet coherence,"There exists a huge gape in the accurate assessment of nighttime air quality of metropolitan cities. So, in this article, we used Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data from May 16, 2016, to April 30, 2023, to access the nighttime variability of air quality over Naples (Italy). Maximum value (0.26) of aerosol optical depth (AOD) observed during June is because of relative increase in temperature that causes the scattering of pollutants. High value (1.47) of Angstrom exponent (AE) during January indicates the dominance of fine mode particles. Maximum value of precipitable water (3.0) is observed in August. Furthermore, the classification of nighttime aerosols associated with AOD and AE reveals the dominance (73.23%) of urban/industrial aerosols. In addition, nighttime variability of CH4, CO, and O3are observed high during October, March, and May, respectively. The 72-h air mass backward trajectories plotted on April 23, 2019, at 1500 m, 1000 m, and 500 m indicate the transportation of pollutants from the western northeastern regions of Africa which indicates the transportation of dust particles transported from the Sahara Desert. Naples has the worst air quality in the last couple of years due to rapid urbanization, biomass burning, and fuel combustion. Wavelet coherence (WTC) analysis reveals that AOD has a significant association with temperature, relative humidity, CH4, CO, and O3 in both the long run and short run. A noticeable region of co-movement is observed in the frequency band of almost 8–16 months. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.",no,No,No,No
"Multi-model revealing the driving factors of black carbon pollution in Hohhot, the largest city on the Mongolian plateau","There remains a lack of comprehensive and systematic understanding of black carbon (BC) on the Mongolian Plateau. This study investigates the characteristics and sources of BC in Hohhot, the largest city on the Mongolian Plateau, particularly analyzing the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on BC. During the lockdown period (LD), the BC concentration decreased by 38.2% due to reduced emission intensity and improved diffusion conditions. The annal mean concentrations of fossil fuel BC (BCff) and biomass burning BC were 0.50 ± 0.71 μg/m3 and 1.01 ± 1.01 μg/m3, respectively, accounting for 33.1% and 66.9% of BC. The contribution of BCff significantly decreased from pre-lockdown (61.9%) to LD (51.8%). Due to the resumption of transportation activities during post-lockdown, the BCff contribution bounced back to 61.7%. Compared with pre-lockdown, BC concentration decreased by 1.24 μg/m3 during LD. The reduction of anthropogenic emissions (meteorological changes) contributed 0.84 μg/m3 (0.40 μg/m3) to this decrease, accounting for 67.7% (32.3%) of the BC variation. Due to strict transportation restrictions, the fossil fuel BC concentration significantly decreased during LD, contributing to 78.2% of the BC variation. This study provides essential data for the formulation of BC pollution control measures and policies to address climate change in cities on the Mongolian Plateau. © 2023",yes,No,No,Yes
Plant versus local soil inorganic ionic composition: The relationship to biomass smoke,"We examine the relationship between soil and plant inorganic chemical composition as a precursor to biomass smoke aerosol particle (PM2.5) properties in desert landscapes of the Southwestern United States. Past work underscored the importance of plant species and in particular the dependence of smoke PM2.5 water uptake on the water-soluble inorganics important in select plant species (e.g., halophytes) versus absent in other species (e.g., conifers). This study extends this work by looking at a range of soil types and salinity in examining native and invasive species in the Desert Southwest US region. Eighteen plant samples and surrounding soils were taken from four ecosystems in New Mexico, USA. Results here support the conclusion that plant species are the primary controller over the inorganic plant composition that is relevant to biomass smoke and controls its hygroscopicity. The role of soil type is secondary to plant inorganic composition but is found to be important on the ecosystem level in determining what plant species are viable in a given ecosystem. This ultimately affects the smoke properties, including PM2.5 hygroscopicity (water uptake), produced in landscape fires. Knowledge of ecosystem features including plant species distribution and soil salinity may be combined as a first-order predictor of PM2.5 hygroscopicity of the primary smoke emissions. This can be particularly useful when combined with knowledge of burn characteristics such as flame temperature, which also plays a key role in determining PM2.5 water uptake response. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,No,Yes
"Does Stubble Burning Really Contribute in Delhi’s Air Pollution? Evidences from Ground, Model, and Satellite Data","This study investigates the truth behind conversations on stubble burning (SB) contribution to Delhi’s air pollution (DAP) using ground observations, geophysical models, and satellite-based measurements during 2019 and 2020. Pieces of evidence from ground-based measurements showed a drastic increase in the pollutant concentration during the SB episode (October–November of each year), which leads to the increased air quality index (AQI), confirming the significant contribution of SB in DAP along with internal sources. Geophysical models, including Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) back trajectories and Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS), also indicated the contribution of regional SB in DAP. Measurements from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imagine Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Sentinel-P5 satellites further strengthen our findings on the regional contribution of SB, majorly from Punjab and Haryana in DAP. Nevertheless, the meteorological conditions (derived both from ground and satellite) worsen the situation of pollution in Delhi during winter.

Dual roles of the inorganic aqueous phase on secondary organic aerosol growth from benzene and phenol,"Benzene, emitted from automobile exhaust and biomass burning, is ubiquitous in ambient air. Benzene is a precursor hydrocarbon (HC) that forms secondary organic aerosol (SOA), but its SOA formation mechanism is not well studied. To accurately predict the formation of benzene SOA, it is important to understand the gas mechanisms of phenol, which is one of the major products formed from the atmospheric oxidation of benzene. Laboratory data presented herein highlight the impact of the aqueous phase on SOA generated through benzene and phenol oxidation. The roles of the aqueous phase consist of (1) suppression of the aging of hydrocarbon and (2) conventional acid-catalyzed reactions in the inorganic phase. To explain this unusual effect, it is hypothesized that a persistent phenoxy radical (PPR) effectively forms via a heterogeneous reaction of phenol and phenol-related products in the presence of wet inorganic aerosol. These PPR species are capable of catalytically consuming ozone during an NOx cycle and negatively influencing SOA growth. In this study, explicit gas mechanisms were derived to produce the oxygenated products from the atmospheric oxidation of phenol or benzene. Gas mechanisms include the existing Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v3.3.1), the reaction path for peroxy radical adducts originating from the addition of an OH radical to phenols forming low-volatility products (e.g., multi-hydroxy aromatics), and the mechanisms to form heterogeneous production of PPR. The simulated gas products were classified into volatility- and reactivity-based lumped species and incorporated into the Unified Partitioning Aerosol Reaction (UNIPAR) model that predicts SOA formation via multiphase reactions of phenol or benzene. The predictability of the UNIPAR model was examined using chamber data, which were generated for the photooxidation of phenol or benzene under controlled experimental conditions (NOx levels, humidity, and inorganic seed types). The SOA formation from both phenol and benzene still increased in the presence of wet inorganic seed because of the oligomerization of reactive organic species in the aqueous phase. However, model simulations show a significant suppression of ozone, the oxidation of phenol or benzene, and SOA growth compared with those without PPR mechanisms. The production of PPR is accelerated in the presence of acidic aerosol and this weakens SOA growth. In benzene oxidation, up to 53ĝ€¯% of the oxidation pathway is connected to phenol formation in the reported gas mechanism. Thus, the contribution of PPR to gas mechanisms is less than that of phenol. Overall, SOA growth in phenol or benzene is negatively related to NOx levels in the high-NOx region (HC ppbCĝ€¯/ĝ€¯NOx ppbĝ€¯<ĝ€¯5). However, the simulation indicates that the significance of PPR rises with decreasing NOx levels. Hence, the influence of NOx levels on SOA formation from phenol or benzene is complex under varying temperature and seed type conditions. Adding the comprehensive reaction of phenolic compounds will improve the prediction of SOA formation from aromatic HCs due to the missing mechanisms in the current air quality model.  © Copyright: ",no,No,No,No
Real-Time Source Apportionment of Particulate Matter from Low-Cost Particle Sensors Using Machine Learning,"Low-cost sensors (LCS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their application in urban air quality mapping, community monitoring networks, indoor air quality monitoring, personal exposure monitoring, and citizen science initiatives. This study has developed an integrated approach combining measurements from LCS and existing source apportionment (SA) results with machine learning (ML) algorithms to achieve real-time SA. Source contributions apportioned by Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) model and PM2.5 as well as particle number concentration (PNC) in size bins (0–0.3 μm, 0.3–0.5 μm, 0.5–1 μm, and 1–2.5 μm) from LCS are acquired from May 2019 to February 2020 at Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium (NS), Delhi. The PNC in size bins was converted to mass (PM0 − 0.3, PM0.3 − 0.5, PM0.5 − 1, PM1 − 2.5) for respective sizes. The objective function is {S1, S2, S3, …. S8} = f {PM0 − 0.3, PM0.3 − 0.5, PM0.5 − 1, PM1 − 2.5, PM2.5} where S1, S2, S3, …. S8 are the sources. Four ML algorithms, namely support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbour (kNN), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB), are applied for SA. GB performs the best among all algorithms with a train and test score (R2) of 0.82 and 0.75. The R2 (in parentheses) between actual and predicted PM2.5 for sources of biomass burning (0.92), dust (0.83), gasoline vehicle (0.75), diesel vehicle (0.78), coal combustion (0.70), waste burning (0.76), industrial (0.77) and secondary aerosol (0.89) indicate the acceptable performance of the model. The statistical t-test comparing the PM2.5 contributions obtained from CMB and ML for each source indicates no significant difference (p > 0.05) except for dust and waste burning. This study demonstrated the ability of LCS to perform real-time SA with the help of an existing dataset. This cost-effective approach will provide rough estimations of the sources to regulatory agencies and policymakers for immediate action. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy Sciences 2024.",yes,No,No,Yes
"A long-term, dispersion normalized PMF source apportionment of PM2.5 in Atlanta from 2005 to 2019","This study assessed the effects of policy implementations and economic drivers on the identified sources of particulate pollution and their contributions to the ambient PM2.5 concentrations in Atlanta, Georgia during 2005–2019. Dispersion-normalized positive matrix factorization (DN-PMF) was applied to account for meteorological impacts on the ambient concentrations. Secondary sulfate, gasoline vehicle, diesel vehicle, biomass burning, secondary nitrate, dust/road dust, aged sea salt, copper and pyrolyzed carbon were resolved for the study period. Among them, secondary sulfate was the largest contributor to the PM2.5 mass concentrations. A substantial decrease in its concentrations was observed both after 2008 and after 2017 due to the implementation of the Georgia Multipollutant Control for Electric Utility Steam Generating Units rule in 2007 and the new Tier 3 Motor Vehicle Emission Standards in 2017. Emissions from gasoline and diesel vehicles as well as secondary nitrate also decreased after 2008. However, the reductions in gasoline and diesel emissions can be attributed to the two years of economic recession, implementation of the Georgia Gasoline Marketing Rule and regulations under the Heavy-Duty Diesel Rule. The decrease in emissions of secondary nitrate was observed after introduction of entire year control on NOx emissions promulgated by the regulations under the Clean Air Interstate rule and the Georgia NOx Emission from Electric Utility Stream Generating Units rule. Alternatively, elevated summer values were characteristic of the biomass burning, pyrolyzed carbon and dust/road dust factors. The elevated summer biomass burning emissions in 2019 were likely due to two wildfires southwest of Atlanta, while the elevated summer dust/road dust factor values were due to transported Saharan dust episodes. Identification of the copper factor at this Atlanta site was linked to the poor venting of a high-volume sampler with a copper brush motor. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",yes,No,No,Yes
Bottom-Up Evaluation of the Methane Budget in Asia and Its Subregions,"A comprehensive methane (CH4 ) budget, including spatial and temporal patterns of sources and sinks, is pivotal for effective climatic mitigation and prediction. This study used a bottom-up approach to evaluate the CH4 budget of Asia during 1970–2021. Natural sources and sinks were evaluated using a process-based biogeochemical model and with ground and satellite observations. Anthropogenic sources were evaluated using emission inventories produced by socioeconomic studies. During the 1970s and 2010s, anthropogenic emissions accounted for 78% and 84% of the emitted total CH4 budget of 140.2 and 207.6 Tg CH4 yr−1, respectively. Anthropogenic sources were responsible for a 49% increase in total emissions. During 2001–2021, Central, East, South, Southeast, and West Asia accounted for 3.3%, 35.1%, 25.6%, 23.1%, and 13.0%, respectively, of Asian emissions. Sectoral compositions and temporal variations differed among subregions. Emissions from paddy field soils in Asia were smaller in 2021 (33.6 Tg CH4 yr−1) than in 1970 (39.2 Tg CH4 yr−1) because of changes in agricultural production. Among natural sources, wetlands accounted for 63% of total emissions in East Asia, but geological emissions predominated in Central and West Asia. Interannual variability of the net CH4 budget was mainly due to wetland and biomass burning emissions, whereas decadal variability was due to anthropogenic sectors. δ13C-CH4 and isoflux analysis of sector-specific fluxes and isotopic ratios indicated the effects of the regional budget on atmospheric trends. Bottom-up evaluations of regional budgets can provide information critical to the Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement, the Global Methane Pledge, and other related actions. © 2023.

The fate of rice crop residues and context-dependent greenhouse gas emissions: Model-based insights from Eastern India,"Crop residue burning is a common practice in many parts of the world that causes air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Regenerative practices that return residues to the soil offer a ‘no burn’ pathway for addressing air pollution while building soil organic carbon (SOC). Nevertheless, GHG emissions in rice-based agricultural systems are complex and difficult to anticipate, particularly in production contexts with highly variable hydrologic conditions. Here we predict long-term net GHG fluxes for four rice residue management strategies in the context of rice-wheat cropping systems in Eastern India: burning, soil incorporation, livestock fodder, and biochar. Estimations were based on a combination of Tier 1, 2, and 3 modelling approaches, including 100-year DNDC simulations across three representative soil hydrologic categories (i.e., dry, median, and wet). Overall, residue burning resulted in total direct GHG fluxes of 2.5, 6.1, and 8.7 Mg CO2-e in the dry, median, and wet hydrologic categories, respectively. Relative to emissions from burning (positive values indicate an increase) for the same dry to wet hydrologic categories, soil incorporation resulted in a −0.2, 1.8, or 3.1 Mg CO2-e change in emissions whereas use of residues for livestock fodder increased emissions by 2.0, 2.1, or 2.3 Mg CO2-e. Biochar reduced emissions relative to burning by 2.9 Mg CO2-e in all hydrologic categories. This study showed that the production environment has a controlling effect on methane and, therefore, net GHG balance. For example, wetter sites had 2.8–4.0 times greater CH4 emissions, on average, than dry sites when rice residues were returned to the soil. To effectively mitigate burning without undermining climate change mitigation goals, our results suggest that geographically-target approaches should be used in the rice-based systems of Eastern India to incentivize the adoption of regenerative ‘no burn’ residue management practices. © 2024 The Authors",yes,No,No,Yes
Near-source dispersion and coagulation parameterization: Application to biomass burning emissions,"Aerosol size distributions near biomass-burning sources undergo rapid evolution, primarily due to coagulation, which significantly alters the particle number size distribution. Existing long-range aerosol transport and climate prediction models often overlook near-source dynamics involving simultaneous coagulation and dispersion. To bridge this gap, the present study introduces a coagulation-dispersion model and provides semi-analytical solutions for the effective size distribution parameters. The precise solution for a diffusion-less coagulating plume with spatially varying particle concentration supports the conceptual accuracy of the semi-analytical parameterization for dispersion-coagulation model. These solutions form the basis for a parameterization scheme that considers input parameters such as source dimensions, particle mass flux, particle size, and atmospheric conditions. Utilizing this parameterization for case-specific biomass burning emissions shows a decrease in number emission rate by approximately a factor of 600, while the count median diameter of the initial size distribution increases by around 7 times. Additionally, we estimate the optical properties of aerosols both before and after the introduction of the near-source parameterization scheme. Results indicate an increase by a factor of 4 in the aerosol extinction coefficient and by a factor of ∼20 in the scattering coefficient, which will significantly influence the calculation of aerosol optical properties in global models. These changes in optical properties primarily stem from modifications in aerosol size distribution resulting from near-source aerosol dynamics. The results are further discussed. © 2024 The Authors",yes,Yes,No,Yes
Assessment of smoke plume height products derived from multisource satellite observations using lidar-derived height metrics for wildfires in the western US,"As wildfires intensify and fire seasons lengthen across the western US, the development of models that can predict smoke plume concentrations and track wildfire-induced air pollution exposures has become critical. Wildfire smoke plume height is a key indicator of the vertical placement of plume mass emitted from wildfire-related aerosol sources in climate and air quality models. With advancements in Earth observation (EO) satellites, spaceborne products for aerosol layer height or plume injection height have recently emerged with increased global-scale spatiotemporal resolution. However, to evaluate column radiative effects and refine satellite algorithms, vertical profiles of regionally representative aerosol properties from wildfires need to be measured directly. In this study, we conducted the first comprehensive evaluation of four passive satellite remote-sensing techniques specifically designed for retrieving plume height. We compared these satellite products with the airborne Wyoming Cloud Lidar (WCL) measurements during the 2018 Biomass Burning Flux Measurements of Trace Gases and Aerosols (BB-FLUX) field campaign in the western US. Two definitions, namely, ""plume top""and ""extinction-weighted mean plume height"", were used to derive the representative heights of wildfire smoke plumes, based on the WCL-derived vertical aerosol extinction coefficient profiles. Using these two definitions, we performed a comparative analysis of multisource satellite-derived plume height products for wildfire smoke. We provide a discussion related to which satellite product is most appropriate for determining plume height characteristics near a fire event or estimating downwind plume rise equivalent height, under multiple aerosol loadings. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the sensitivity of different passive remote-sensing techniques on space-based wildfire smoke plume height observations, in order to resolve ambiguity surrounding the concept of ""effective smoke plume height"". As additional aerosol-observing satellites are planned in the coming years, our results will inform future remote-sensing missions and EO satellite algorithm development. This bridges the gap between satellite observations and plume rise modeling to further investigate the vertical distribution of wildfire smoke aerosols.  © 2024 Copernicus Publications.

Improving Machine Learning Based PM2.5 Prediction by Segregating Biomass Emission Factor from Chemical Transport Model,"Located in the heart of Mainland Southeast Asia, Thailand is associated with high biomass burning (BB) activities from local and neighbouring countries. The seasonal pattern of BB manifests itself as a potential predictor for PM2.5 concentration. Consequently, we enhanced machine learning based PM2.5 prediction by segregating BB factor from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ). Two Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models with different CMAQ predictors were developed: the BB-integrated model, which incorporated CMAQ-simulated PM2.5 from all emission sources and the BB-segregated model, which incorporated CMAQ-simulated PM2.5 from sources other than BB (CMAQ_PM25_Othr) and CMAQ-simulated PM2.5 from BB emissions (CMAQ_PM25_BB). The two models had shared control predictors, which included simulated meteorological variables from WRF model, population, elevation, and land-use variables, and they were evaluated using a crossvalidation (CV). The BB-segregated model outperformed the BB-integrated model, achieving overall-CV R2 values of 0.86 and 0.82, respectively. The analysis of feature importance for the BB-segregated model indicates that CMAQ_PM25_Othr and CMAQ_PM25_BB are the two most significant predictors. These findings emphasize the importance of considering BB emissions when predicting PM2.5 concentrations, particularly in regions with high BB activities.  © 2024 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",yes,No,No,Yes
Estimating Fire Radiative Power Using Weather Radar Products for Wildfires,"Satellite-based Fire radiative power (FRP) retrievals are used to track wildfire activity but are sometimes not possible or have large uncertainties. Here, we show that weather radar products including composite and base reflectivity and equivalent rainfall integrated in the vicinity of the fires show strong correlation with hourly FRP for multiple fires during 2019–2020. Correlation decreases when radar beams are blocked by topography and when there is significant ground clutter (GC) and anomalous propagation (AP). GC/AP can be effectively removed using a machine learning classifier trained with radar retrieved correlation coefficient, velocity, and spectrum width. We find a power-law best describes the relationship between radar products and FRP for multiple fires combined (0.67–0.76 R2). Radar-based FRP estimates can be used to fill gaps in satellite FRP created by cloud cover and show great potential to overcome satellite FRP biases occurring during extreme fire events. © 2023 The Authors.",no,No,No,No
Causes of an extremely low visibility event in Northeast China,"An extreme haze-fog event occurred during October 20–22, 2013, in Harbin, Northeast China, which lasted for nearly 60 h with local visibility as low as 20 m. However, causes of the extreme haze-fog formation remain unclear. Through the analysis of in situ data and objective weather circulation classification, it is revealed that high pollutant emissions from biomass burning played a very important role in the extreme event. Stable weather conditions under the circulation type 8 (CT8), marked by weak high-pressure control, strong inversion (6.55°C), shallow boundary layer depth (<300 m), and high relative humidity (>90%), aided in the accumulation of pollutants and hygroscopic aerosol growth. All of these factors collectively contributed to the extreme haze-fog formation. The insights derived from this study can improve the predictability of extreme haze-fog events, and indicate that pollution emissions should be tightly controlled in the adverse meteorological circulation type in Northeast China. © 2024 The Authors.

Black carbon concentrations and modeled smoke deposition fluxes to the bare-ice dark zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet,"Ice-albedo feedbacks in the ablation region of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) are difficult to constrain and model due, in part, to our limited understanding of the seasonal evolution of the bare-ice region. To help fill observational gaps, 13 surface samples were collected on the GrIS across the 2014 summer melt season from patches of snow and ice that were visibly light, medium, and dark colored. These samples were analyzed for their refractory black carbon (rBC) concentrations and size distributions with a single-particle soot photometer coupled to a characterized nebulizer. We present a size distribution of rBC in fresh snow on the GrIS and from the weathering crust in the bare-ice dark zone of the GrIS. The size distributions from the weathering crust samples appear unimodal and were overall smaller than the fresh snow sample, with a peak around 0.3 μm. The fresh snow sample contained very large rBC particles that had a pronounced bimodality in the peak size distributions, with peaks around 0.2 and 2 μm. rBC concentrations ranged from a minimum of 3 μg-rBC/L-H2O in light-colored patches at the beginning and end of the melt season to a maximum of 32 μg-rBC/L-H2O in a dark patch in early August. On average, the rBC concentrations were higher (20 ± 10 μg-rBC/L-H2O) in patches that were visibly dark, compared to medium patches (7 ± 2 μg-rBC/L-H2O) and light patches (4 ± 1 μg-rBC/L-H2O), suggesting that BC aggregation contributed to snow aging on the GrIS, and vice versa. Additionally, concentrations peaked in light and dark patches in early August, which is likely due to smoke transport from wildfires in northern Canada and Alaska, as supported by the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) reanalysis model. According to the model output, 26 mgm-3 of biomass-burning-derived smoke was deposited between 1 April and 30 August, of which 85 % came from wet deposition, and 67 % was deposited during our sample collection time frame. The increase in the rBC concentration and size distributions immediately after the modeled smoke deposition fluxes suggest that biomass burning smoke is a source of BC to the dark zone of the GrIS. Thus, the role of BC in the seasonal evolution of the ice-albedo feedbacks should continue to be investigated in the weathering crust of the bare-ice zone of the GrIS. © 2023 Alia L.

1D-CNN Network Based Real-Time Aerosol Particle Classification with Single-Particle Mass Spectrometry,"Single-particle mass spectrometry (SPMS) is a measurement technique that aims to identify the chemical composition of individual airborne aerosol particles (PM 1 or PM 2.5) in real time. One-dimensional (1-D) spectral data of aerosol particles generated by SPMS carry rich information about the chemical composition associated with the sources of the particles, e.g., traffic and ship emissions, biomass burning, etc. Accurate classification of aerosol particles is essential to understand their sources and effects on human health. This letter investigates the application of SPMS and 1-D-convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) in aerosol particle classification. The proposed 1D-CNN achieved a mean classification accuracy of 90.4% with 13 particle classes.

"Insights the dominant contribution of biomass burning to methanol-soluble PM2.5 bounded oxidation potential based on multilayer perceptron neural network analysis in Xi'an, China","Atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality due to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ambient PM2.5 samples were collected during heating and nonheating seasons in Xi'an, China, and the ROS-generation potential of PM2.5 was quantified using the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Additionally, positive matrix factorization combined with multilayer perceptron was employed to apportion sources contributing to the oxidation potential of PM2.5. Both the mass concentration of PM2.5 and the volume-based DTT activity (DTTv) were higher during the heating season than during the nonheating season. The primary contributors to DTTv were combustion (biomass and coal) sources during the heating season (>52 %), whereas secondary formation dominated DTT activity during the nonheating season (35.7 %). In addition, the secondary reaction process promoted the generation of intrinsic oxidation potential (OP) of sources. Among all the sources investigated (traffic source, industrial emission, mineral dust, biomass burning, secondary formation and coal combustion), the inherent oxidation potential of biomass burning was the highest, whereas that of mineral dust was the lowest. Our study indicates that anthropogenic sources, especially biomass burning, should be prioritized in PM2.5 toxicity control strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,No,Yes
Air quality impacts of observationally constrained biomass burning heat flux inputs,"Biomass burning is a major contributor to ambient air pollution worldwide, and the accurate characterization of biomass burning plume behavior is an important consideration for air quality models that attempt to reproduce these emissions. Smoke plume injection height, or the vertical level into which the combustion emissions are released, is an important consideration for determining plume behavior, transport, and eventual impacts. This injection height is dependent on several fire properties, each with estimates and uncertainties in terms of historical fire emissions inventories. One such property is the fire heat flux, a fire property metric sometimes used to predict and parameterize plume injection heights in current chemical transport models. Although important for plume behavior, fire heat flux is difficult to predict and parameterize efficiently, and is therefore often held to fixed, constant values in these models, leading to potential model biases relative to real world conditions. In this study we collect observed heat flux estimates from satellite data products for three wildfire events over northern California and use these estimates in a regional chemical transport model to investigate and quantify the impacts of observationally constrained heat fluxes on the modeled injection height and downwind air quality. We find large differences between these observationally derived heat flux estimates and fixed model assumptions, with important implications for modeled behavior of plume dynamics and surface air quality impacts. Overall, we find that using observationally constrained heat flux estimates tends to reduce modeled injection heights for our chosen fires, resulting in large increases in surface particulate matter concentrations. While local wind conditions contribute to variability and additional uncertainties in the impacts of modified plume injection heights, we find observationally constrained heat fluxes to be an impactful and potentially useful tool towards the improvement of emissions inventory assumptions and parameterizations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",no,No,No,No
"Spatiotemporal distribution, light absorption characteristics, and source apportionments of black and brown carbon in China","Black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) are aerosols that absorb light and thereby contribute to climate change. In this study, the light absorption properties and spatiotemporal distributions of equivalent BC (eBC) and BrC aerosols were determined based on continuous measurements of aerosol light absorption from January to August 2017, using a seven-channel aethalometer at 49 sampling sites in China. The source apportionments of BC and BrC were identified using the BC/PM2.5, absorption Ångström exponent, the concentration-weighted trajectory method, and the random forest model. Based on the results, BC was the dominant light absorber, whereas BrC was responsible for a higher proportion of the light absorption in northern compared to southern China. The light absorption of BrC was highest in winter (34.3 Mm−1), followed by spring (19.0 Mm−1) and summer (3.6 Mm−1). The combustion of liquid fuels accounted for over 50 % of the light absorption coefficient of BC in most cities and the importance of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was over 10 % for BC emitted by liquid fuel combustion, based on the random forest model. The contribution of solid fuel combustion to BC in the north was larger than that in the southern regions as coal combustion and crop residue burning are important emission sources of BC in most northern cities. The contribution of primary BrC to light absorption was high in some northern cities, whereas that of secondary BrC was prevalent in some southern cities. The diurnal variations in secondary BrC were affected by changes in odd oxygen and relative humidity, which promoted the photobleaching of the chromophores and aqueous-phase reactions of secondary BrC. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",no,No,No,No
"Assessing school children's personal exposure to PM2.5 in Suva, Fiji","Globally, there is little information on children's personal exposure to particle pollution in developing countries, and hardly any in the Pacific Island Countries. This study was conducted with school children in Suva, Fiji, with the aim of assisting to fill this gap in knowledge. The participants included eighty-four children ranging from 10 to 15 years of age from five schools and two communities, defined as Group A and Group B, respectively. Each child was fitted with a KOALA air quality monitor which measured PM2.5 and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in real time over 24 h. Time activity diaries (TAD) and questionnaires were used by the students to record the start and end times of each activity in the different microenvironments occupied. For both groups, the PM2.5 concentration averaged over all children showed three distinct peaks in the morning, midday and in the evening. Several CO peaks were formed at different times of the day. The 24-h average CO concentrations for Group A and Group B students were 0.35 mg/m3 and 0.43 mg/m3, respectively. Time spent in the bedroom showed the highest average exposure (94.3 μg/m3, 301.1 μg/m3) and exposure intensity (5.8, 14.3), with the indoor exposure at home being significantly higher than the outdoor exposure for both groups. Based on the information obtained from the time activity diaries, questionnaires and follow-up interviews, the sources of these particles were most probably from cooking, smoking, burning of mosquito repellent coils, resuspension of dust in the classroom. Although this study could not apportion the specific contributions of emissions from cooking, cigarette smoke and mosquito coils, it may be concluded that these are significant sources for children's exposure and should be controlled. © 2024 The Authors",no,No,No,No
"First close insight into global daily gapless 1 km PM2.5 pollution, variability, and health impact","Here we retrieve global daily 1 km gapless PM2.5 concentrations via machine learning and big data, revealing its spatiotemporal variability at an exceptionally detailed level everywhere every day from 2017 to 2022, valuable for air quality monitoring, climate change, and public health studies. We find that 96%, 82%, and 53% of Earth’s populated areas are exposed to unhealthy air for at least one day, one week, and one month in 2022, respectively. Strong disparities in exposure risks and duration are exhibited between developed and developing countries, urban and rural areas, and different parts of cities. Wave-like dramatic changes in air quality are clearly seen around the world before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdowns, as is the mortality burden linked to fluctuating air pollution events.

Emission Factors of PAHs Components and Bioreactivity in PM2.5 from Biomass Burning,"Biomass burning releases fine particulate matter (PM2.5), water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIs), metal elements, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other compounds, and it is one of the largest sources of carbonaceous aerosols. The lungs experience negative health impacts from exposure to PM2.5; however, it is uncertain how PM2.5 emitted from biomass burning affect the human lung alveolar epithelium. This study investigated emission factors of PM2.5 from biomass burning and PM2.5 bioreactivity in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells. Emission factors were measured from biomass samples included maize straw (MS), wheat straw (WS), wood branches (WBs), MS briquettes (MSBs), MSB charcoal (MSC), WS briquettes (WSBs), WSB charcoal (WSC), WB briquettes (WBBs), and WBB charcoal (WBC). A549 cells were exposed to biomass PM2.5 at 0 and 50 µg mL–1 for 24 h, and the expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP), phosphorylated (p)-YAP, transcription coactivator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), p-TAZ, E-cadherin, and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) proteins were assessed by Western blotting. We found that MSC, WSC, WSBs, and WBs had higher PM2.5 emission factors. MS has the highest emission factors of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among all the biomass PM2.5, especially FLU (26.46 mg kg–1) and PYR (26.93 mg kg–1). There were 48.30% of PM2.5 was able to deposit in the alveolar area with a concentration of 32.25 µg m–3 estimated by a multiple-path particle dosimetry (MPPD) model. We observed decreases in p-YAP/YAP and HMGB1 expressions after biomass PM2.5 exposure. YAP were positively correlated with ANT, PHE, 1-MP, FLU, PYR, 3,6-DP, BaA, CHR, BbF, BkF, BaP, BeP, PER, IcdP, BghiP, and DahA (p < 0.05). In conclusion, PAHs in biomass PM2.5 contribute to cytotoxicity on A549 cells. PAHs in PM2.5 with high emission factors from biomass burning could cause significant human pulmonary deteritious health effects after inhalation. © 2024, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

Implementation and evaluation of updated photolysis rates in the EMEP MSC-W chemistry-transport model using Cloud-J v7.3e,"The present work describes the implementation of the state of the art Cloud-J v7.3 photolysis rate calculation code in the EMEP MSC-W chemistry-transport model. Cloud-J calculates photolysis rates and accounts for cloud and aerosol optical properties at model run time, replacing the old system based on tabulated values. The performance of Cloud-J is evaluated against aerial photolysis rate observations made over the Pacific Ocean and against surface observations from three measurement sites in Europe. Numerical experiments are performed to investigate the sensitivity of the calculated photolysis rates to the spatial and temporal model resolution, input meteorology model, simulated ozone column, and cloud effect parameterization. These experiments indicate that the calculated photolysis rates are most sensitive to the choice of input meteorology model and cloud effect parameterization while also showing that surface ozone photolysis rates can vary by up to 20ĝ€¯% due to daily variations in total ozone column. Further analysis investigates the impact of Cloud-J on the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere, aerosol-photolysis interactions, and surface air quality predictions. Results find that the annual mean mass-weighted tropospheric hydroxyl concentration is increased by 26ĝ€¯%, while the photolytic impact of aerosols is mostly limited to large tropical biomass-burning regions. Overall, Cloud-J represents a major improvement over the tabulated system, leading to improved model performance for predicting carbon monoxide and daily maximum ozone surface concentrations.  © Copyright: ",no,No,No,No
Measurement report: Rapid changes of chemical characteristics and health risks for highly time resolved trace elements in PM2.5 in a typical industrial city in response to stringent clean air actions,"Atmospheric trace metals entail significant damages in human health and ecosystem safety, and thus a series of clean air actions have been implemented to decrease the ambient element concentrations. Unfortunately, the impact of these emission control measures on element concentrations in fine particles remains poorly understood. In our study, the random forest (RF) model was applied to distinguish the effects of emission and meteorology to trace elements in PM2.5 in a typical industrial city named Tangshan based on a 3-year (2017-2020) hourly field observation. The result suggested that the clean air actions have facilitated the dramatic decreases of the deweathered concentrations of Ga, Co, Pb, Zn, and As by 72ĝ€¯%, 67ĝ€¯%, 62ĝ€¯%, 59ĝ€¯%, and 54ĝ€¯%, respectively. It is attributable to the strict implementation of ""coal to gas""strategies and optimisation of industrial structure and layout. However, the deweathered levels of Ca (8.3ĝ€¯%), Cr (18.5ĝ€¯%), and Fe (23ĝ€¯%) only displayed minor decreases, indicating that the emission control measures for ferrous metal smelting and vehicle emission were not very effective. The positive matrix factorisation (PMF) results suggested that the contribution ratios of biomass burning, non-ferrous metal smelting, coal combustion, ferrous metal smelting, heavy oil combustion, and traffic-related dust changed from 33ĝ€¯%, 11ĝ€¯%, 15ĝ€¯%, 13ĝ€¯%, 3ĝ€¯%, and 25ĝ€¯% to 33ĝ€¯%, 8ĝ€¯%, 8ĝ€¯%, 13ĝ€¯%, 4ĝ€¯%, and 33ĝ€¯%, respectively. To date, no significant non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were observed for all of the elements, while both of As and Pb still showed relatively high health damages. It was proposed to further cut down the combustion-related emissions (e.g. As and Pb) because it showed the highest marginal health benefits. Besides this, the control of traffic-related emissions might be a key abatement strategy to facilitate the reduction of elements in fine particles.  © 2023 Copernicus GmbH.

Effect of industrialization on the differences in sources and composition of ambient PM2.5 in two Southern Ontario locations,"PM2.5 was sampled over a seven-year period (2013–2019) at two locations ∼50 km apart in Southern Ontario (concurrently for five years: 2015–2019). One is a heavily industrialized site (Hamilton), while the other was a rural site (Simcoe). To assess the impact of industrialization on the composition and sources of PM affecting air quality in these two locations, positive matrix factorization coupled with dispersion normalization (DN-PMF) was used to identify six and eight factors at Simcoe and Hamilton, respectively. The Simcoe factors in order of diminishing PM mass contribution were: particulate sulphate (pSO4), secondary organic aerosol (SOA), crustal matter, particulate nitrate (pNO3), biomass burning, and vehicular emissions. At Hamilton, the effects of industrialization were observed by the ∼36% higher average ambient PM2.5 concentration for the study period as well as the presence of factors unique to metallurgy, i.e., coking and steelmaking, compared to Simcoe. The coking and steelmaking factors contributed ∼15% to the PM mass at Hamilton. Seasonal variants of appropriate nonparametric trend tests with the associated slopes (Sen's) were used to assess statistically significant changes in the factor contributions to PM2.5 over time. Specifically at Hamilton, a significant decline in PM contributions was noted for coking (−0.03 μg/m³/yr or −4.1%/yr) while steelmaking showed no statistically significant decline over the study period. Other factors at Hamilton that showed statistically significant declines over the study period were: pSO4 (−0.27 μg/m³/yr or −12.6%/yr), biomass burning (−0.05 μg/m³/yr or −9.02%/yr), crustal matter (−0.03 μg/m³/yr or −5.28%/yr). These factors mainly accounted for the significant decline in PM2.5 over the study period (−0.35 μg/m³/yr or −4.24%/yr). This work shows the importance of long-term monitoring in assessing the unique contributions and temporal changes of industrialization on air quality in Ontario and similarly affected locations. © 2023",yes,No,No,Yes
Quantifying the Light-Absorption Properties and Molecular Composition of Brown Carbon Aerosol from Sub-Saharan African Biomass Combustion,"Sub-Saharan Africa is a hotspot for biomass burning (BB)-derived carbonaceous aerosols, including light-absorbing organic (brown) carbon (BrC). However, the chemically complex nature of BrC in BB aerosols from this region is not fully understood. We generated smoke in a chamber through smoldering combustion of common sub-Saharan African biomass fuels (hardwoods, cow dung, savanna grass, and leaves). We quantified aethalometer-based, real-time light-absorption properties of BrC-containing organic-rich BB aerosols, accounting for variations in wavelength, fuel type, relative humidity, and photochemical aging conditions. In filter samples collected from the chamber and Botswana in the winter, we identified 182 BrC species, classified into lignin pyrolysis products, nitroaromatics, coumarins, stilbenes, and flavonoids. Using an extensive set of standards, we determined species-specific mass and emission factors. Our analysis revealed a linear relationship between the combined BrC species contribution to chamber-measured BB aerosol mass (0.4-14%) and the mass-absorption cross-section at 370 nm (0.2-2.2 m2 g-1). Hierarchical clustering resolved key molecular-level components from the BrC matrix, with photochemically aged emissions from leaf and cow-dung burning showing BrC fingerprints similar to those found in Botswana aerosols. These quantitative findings could potentially help refine climate model predictions, aid in source apportionment, and inform effective air quality management policies for human health and the global climate. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",no,No,No,No
"Analysis of PM2.5 inorganic and organic constituents to resolve contributing sources in Seoul, South Korea and Beijing, China and their possible associations with cytokine IL-8","China and South Korea are the most polluted countries in East Asia due to significant urbanization and extensive industrial activities. As neighboring countries, collaborative management plans to maximize public health in both countries can be helpful in reducing transboundary air pollution. To support such planning, PM2.5 inorganic and organic species were determined in simultaneously collected PM2.5 integrated filters. The resulting data were used as inputs to positive matrix factorization, which identified nine sources at the ambient air monitoring sites in both sites. Secondary nitrate, secondary sulfate/oil combustion, soil, mobile, incinerator, biomass burning, and secondary organic carbon (SOC) were found to be sources at both sampling sites. Industry I and II were only identified in Seoul, whereas combustion and road dust sources were only identified in Beijing. A subset of samples was selected for exposure assessment. The expression levels of IL-8 were significantly higher in Beijing (167.7 pg/mL) than in Seoul (72.7 pg/mL). The associations between the PM2.5 chemical constituents and its contributing sources with PM2.5-induced inflammatory cytokine (interleukin-8, IL-8) levels in human bronchial epithelial cells were investigated. For Seoul, the soil followed by the secondary nitrate and the biomass burning showed increase with IL-8 production. However, for the Beijing, the secondary nitrate exhibited the highest association with IL-8 production and SOC and biomass burning showed modest increase with IL-8. As one of the highest contributing sources in both cities, secondary nitrate showed an association with IL-8 production. The soil source having the strongest association with IL-8 production was found only for Seoul, whereas SOC showed a modest association only for Beijing. This study can provide the scientific basis for identifying the sources to be prioritized for control to provide effective mitigation of particulate air pollution in each city and thereby improve public health. © 2023 The Authors",yes,No,No,Yes
A hybrid model to improve WRF-Chem performance for crop burning emissions of PM2.5 and secondary aerosols in North India,"In north India (about 30,000 km2 area), October–November months witness crop residue burning (CRB). This study aims to assess the impact of CRB emissions on PM2.5 and secondary aerosol (SA) at distances far from the sources. Chemical transport model, WRF-Chem (with chemical mechanisms, RADM2 and MADE/SORGAM), was applied to a domain of 840 × 840 km2 (centered around Delhi) with inputs of emissions of anthropogenic sources of EDGAR-HTAP and fire inventory from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research, USA. In parallel, measurements of PM2.5 and its constituents, CO, and NO2 were undertaken in Delhi and Kanpur. The model underestimated PM2.5 and showed poor predictions (r < 0.15) with insignificant formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) (< 1% in PM2.5). To improve the model, a linear regression-based hybrid model (HM) was developed that utilized the mechanistic processes of WRF-Chem and observed levels of PM2.5, CO and NO2. The HM performed adequately at multiple sites in Delhi (r = 0.19–0.47) and Kanpur (r = 0.38–0.43). The contribution of CRB to PM2.5 was at 31 ± 16% (in 232 ± 36 μg/m3) in Delhi and 21 ± 15% (in 233 ± 38 μg/m3) in Kanpur. The contribution of SOA in CRB-contributed PM2.5 was 18 ± 9% (Delhi) and 29 ± 21% (Kanpur). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,No,Yes
Aerosol classification using fuzzy clustering over a tropical rural site,"Exact knowledge on the types of aerosols present over a region is very important in the radiative forcing estimates. Several techniques are available to classify aerosols, which have their own pros and cons. In the present study, a soft clustering technique, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is employed to classify aerosols using multiple aerosol parameters over a rural site Gadanki (13.48oN, 79.18°E), India. The optical and microphysical properties of the aerosols (26 parameters) derived from long-term measurements of the Sky Radiometer (from April 2008 to October 2020) are utilized for cluster analysis. The three resultant clusters were found to be distinct and compact based on high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity. By comparing the clustering results of different subsets of data and testing the robustness of the FCM algorithm, we found that the correct classification percentage for each scenario was about 98.4%. Even by introducing a 10% random error for each of the aerosol microphysical properties used in the cluster analysis, around 94.5% of the records were found to retain the original clusters. Based on the aerosol properties of the clusters, the three clusters were identified as mixed mode moderately absorbing, mixed mode slightly absorbing, and coarse mode slightly absorbing type of aerosols. While comparing with the global aerosol models, these three aerosol types showed similarities with biomass burning, polluted marine, and polluted continental aerosol types. Significant seasonal variability of the identified aerosol types was observed, with biomass burning type dominating in the pre-monsoon season, polluted marine during the monsoon season, and polluted continental in a relatively higher percentage compared to the other two types in winter and post-monsoon seasons. An increasing trend in polluted marine aerosol type is noticed, whilst biomass burning and polluted continental showed decreasing trends. Furthermore, the existing knowledge on various aspects of aerosols over Gadanki ascertains that the identified aerosol types are reasonable, implying that the FCM clustering technique for aerosol classification is effective and it might be extend to other locations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",yes,No,No,Yes
Aerosol Load-Cloud Cover Correlation: A Potential Clue for the Investigation of Aerosol Indirect Impact on Climate of Europe and Africa,"Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a key parameter in atmospheric pollution and climate processes. In this paper, we compared the aerosol loading (550 nm) from 2000–2001 to 2017–2018 and total cloud cover using seasonal, latitudinal and solar activity cycle data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and determined the spectral optical range from the region of relatively clear air (Europe) to the region of more considerable biomass burning activity (Africa). To remove the large annual cycle influence, the data were deseasonalized, allowing exploration of inter-annual variability. Deseasonalization obtains the time series AOD monthly average anomaly over the years for each grid cell. We employ the solar flux index over the regions by correlating the absolute percentage mean difference of aerosol and cloud interactions and validate the result by modeling aerosol and cloud data from 2020 to 2021 using a neural network. AOD and solar flux for Africa show correlations of − 0.638 for 2000–2001 and − 0.218 for Europe, and at the same time, AOD with cloud cover for Africa shows correlations of − 0.129 and 0.360 for Europe. The analysis confirmed an inverse weak correlation of aerosols with cloud cover. This would help resolve the knowledge gap by demonstrating that aerosol and cloud interactions are not only dependent on region but also more dependent on the solar activity cycle and seasons. We observed dependence by the latitude of the aerosol load and solar flux index. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy Sciences.",no,No,No,No
Long-term trends in particulate matter from wood burning in the United Kingdom: Dependence on weather and social factors,"Particulate matter from wood burning emissions (Cwood) was quantified at five locations in the United Kingdom (UK), comprising three rural and two urban sites between 2009 and 2021. The aethalometer method was used. Mean winter Cwood concentrations ranged from 0.26 μg m−3 (in rural Scotland) to 1.30 μg m−3 (London), which represented on average 4% (in rural environments) and 5% (urban) of PM10 concentrations; and 8% of PM2.5. Concentrations were greatest in the evenings in winter months, with larger evening concentrations in the weekends at the urban sites. Random-forest (RF) machine learning regression models were used to reconstruct Cwood concentrations using both meteorological and temporal explanatory variables at each site. The partial dependency plots indicated that temperature and wind speed were the meteorological variables explaining the greatest variability in Cwood, with larger concentrations during cold and calm conditions. Peaks of Cwood concentrations took place during and after events that are celebrated with bonfires. These were Guy Fawkes events in the urban areas and on New Year's Day at the rural sites; the later probably related to long-range transport. Time series were built using the RF. Having removed weather influences, long-term trends of Cwood were estimated using the Theil Sen method. Trends for 2015–2021 were downward at three of the locations (London, Glasgow and rural Scotland), with rates ranging from −5.5% year−1 to −2.5% year−1. The replacement of old fireplaces with lower emission wood stoves might explain the decrease in Cwood especially at the urban sites The two rural sites in England observed positive trends for the same period but this was not statistically significant. © 2022 The Authors",no,No,No,No
On the varied emission fingerprints of particulate matter over typical locations of NCR (Delhi) – A perspective for mitigation plans,"Source apportionment study of PM2.5 using positive matrix factorization was performed to identify the emission characteristic from different sectors (sub-urban residential, industrial and rapidly urbanizing) of Delhi during winter. Chemical characterization of PM2.5 included metals (Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb and Zn), water soluble ionic compounds (WSICs) (Cl−, NO3−, SO42− and NH4+) and Carbon partitions (OC, EC). Particulates (PM2.5) were collected on filter twice daily for stable and unstable atmospheric conditions, at the locations with specific characteristics, viz. Ayanagar, Noida and Okhla. Ions solely occupied 50% of the total PM2.5 concentration. Irrespective of location, high correlation between OC and EC (0.871–0.891) at p ≤ 0.1 is observed. Relatively lower ratio of NO3/SO4 at Ayanagar (0.696) and Okhla (0.84) denotes predominance of emission from stationary sources rather than mobile sources like that observed at Noida (1.038). Using EPA PMF5.0, optimum factors for each location are fixed based on error estimation (EE). Crustal dust, vehicular emission, biomass burning and secondary aerosol are the major contributing sources in all the three locations. Incineration contributes about 19% at Ayanagar and 18% at Okhla. Metal industries in Okhla contribute about 19% to PM2.5. These specific local emissions with considerable potency are to be targeted for long-term policymaking. Considerable secondary aerosol contribution (15%–24%) indicates that gaseous emissions also need to be reduced to improve air quality. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",no,No,No,No
A global evaluation of daily to seasonal aerosol and water vapor relationships using a combination of AERONET and NAAPS reanalysis data,"The co-transport of aerosol particles and water vapor has long been noted in the literature, with a myriad of implications such as air mass characterization, radiative transfer, and data assimilation. Here, the relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PW) is evaluated to our knowledge for the first time globally, at daily to seasonal levels using approximately 20 years of NASA Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observational data and the 16-year Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System (NAAPS) reanalysis v1.0 (NAAPS-RA) model fields. The combination of AERONET observations with small uncertainties and the reanalysis fields with global coverage is used to provide a best estimate of the seasonal AOD and PW relationships, including an evaluation of correlations, slope, and PW probability distributions for identification of statistically significant differences in PW for high-AOD events. The relationships produced from the AERONET and NAAPS-RA datasets were compared against each other and showed consistency, indicating that the NAAPS-RA provides a realistic representation of the AOD and PW relationship. The analysis includes layer AOD and PW relationships for proxies of the planetary boundary layer and the lower, middle, and upper free troposphere. The dominant AOD and PW relationship is positive, supported by both AERONET and model evaluation, which varies in strength by season and location. These relationships were found to be statistically significant and present across the globe, observed on an event-by-event level. Evaluations at individual AERONET sites implicate synoptic-scale transport as a contributing factor in these relationships at daily levels. Negative AOD and PW relationships were identified and predominantly associated with regional dry-season timescales in which biomass burning is the predominant aerosol type. This is not an indication of dry-air association with smoke for an individual event but is a reflection of the overall dry conditions leading to more biomass burning and higher associated AOD values. Stronger correlations between AOD and PW are found when evaluating the data by vertical layers, including the boundary layer and the lower, middle, and upper free troposphere (corresponding to typical water vapor channels), with the largest correlations observed in the free troposphere - indicative of aerosol and water vapor transport events. By evaluating the variability between PW and relative humidity in the NAAPS-RA, hygroscopic growth was found to be a dominant term to (1) amplify positive AOD-PW relationships, particularly in the midlatitudes; (2) diminish negative relationships in dominant biomass burning regions; and (3) lead to statistically insignificant changes in PW for high-AOD events for maritime regions. The importance of hygroscopic growth in these relationships indicates that PW is a useful tracer for AOD or light extinction but not necessarily as strongly for aerosol mass. Synoptic-scale African dust events are an exception where PW is a strong tracer for aerosol transport shown by strong relationships even with hygroscopic effects. Given these results, PW can be exploited in coupled aerosol and meteorology data assimilation for AOD, and the collocation of aerosol and water vapor should be carefully taken into account when conducting particulate matter (PM) retrievals from space and in evaluating radiative impacts of aerosol, with the season and location in mind.  © 2023 Juli I.

Study of aerosol optical properties at two urban areas in the north of Vietnam with the implication for biomass burning impacts,"The spatiotemporal distribution and characterization of aerosol optical properties in the north of Vietnam were investigated extensively using the long-term measurements obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (from 2010 to 2019) and two Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations (Nghia Do, Hanoi City, from 2010 to 2019 and Son La from 2012 to 2019) located in fast-developing urban areas. This study also analyzed the tendency of AOD over different wavelengths as well as the influences of meteorological parameters and boundary layer height (BLH) on AOD and Ångström exponent (AE). The annual mean AOD500 at Nghia Do and Son La stations were 0.81 and 0.78, respectively. Our results revealed the existence of particles emitted from anthropogenic activities in Hanoi and Son La with the dominance of fine particles (more than 90% of the AE440–870 were larger than 1). Besides, a high percentage of AE440–870 larger than or approximately 1.5 during the dry and transition months in Son La indicated the existence of biomass-burning aerosol particles due to forest fires and burning of agriculture residuals. The classification results for aerosol types showed the presence of both biomass burning and urban/industrial aerosol types at Nghia Do and Son La sites. Among the investigated meteorological parameters, surface solar radiation expressed a significant correlation with AE440–870 in all three seasons at the two sites due to the secondary formation of fine particles induced by the high solar radiation condition. The impacts of meteorological parameters and BLH on AOD were not observed simultaneously during three seasons at Nghia Do and Son La stations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",yes,No,No,Yes
Classification and transformation of aerosols over selected Indian cities during reduced emissions under Covid-19 lockdown,"Abstract: Studies in the recent past show improved air quality over India during the Covid-19 lockdown. This research attempts to characterize atmospheric aerosols in terms of α and AOD and their transformation over India during the pandemic lockdown. The type and particle distribution of aerosols, including gaseous species for five Indian regions were considered. Fine to coarse particle shift was observed in most regions. The northern region observed high fire counts, implying crop residue burning season during the stringent lockdown. Thiruvananthapuram, in the south, showed an increase in PM, owing to the resumption of mobility post-lockdown. Hyderabad, however; observed increased PM2.5 (2.79%) and AOD (37.23%) during Phase 1. Maritime (MT) aerosol predominated over Thiruvananthapuram, whereas urban/biomass burning (UBB) type decreased over the eastern region. Contributions from continental average (CA), maritime continental average (MCA), and MT were observed over Hyderabad, post-lockdown. In the central region, MCA was replaced by UBB and mixed type, with isolated episodes of clean continental (CC) and desert dust (DD). During lockdown phases, an increase in O3 over western, northern, and central regions is attributed to increased temperature and decreased NO2. A significant correlation with population density (PD) exists with NO2 (R2 = 0.75; p < 0.05), suggesting human mobility as a major contributor to NO2 in the atmosphere during the lockdown period. Highlights: Characterization of atmospheric aerosols during Covid-19 lockdown over India.General shift from fine to coarse particles size in most regions.Crop residue burning increased pollutants in North during lockdown.Forest fire season in central and south-central region increased PM, NO2 concentrations during lockdown.Maritime origin aerosols dominate over Thiruvananthapuram.Decline in pollutants in post-lockdown due to meteorology (early monsoon, cyclone Amphan, and Nisarga). © 2022, Indian Academy of Sciences.",yes,No,No,Yes
Aerosols over the Foothills of the Eastern Himalayan Region during Post-monsoon and Winter Seasons,"In this study a Microtops II sunphotometer is used for the first time over Birtamode, a rapidly growing city located in the eastern Himalayan foothills of Nepal, to measure aerosol optical depth (AOD). The average AOD for the observation period (October 2018–February 2019) was 0.68 ± 0.39 with the post-monsoon season having a higher value (0.74 ± 0.43) compared to the winter season (0.60 ± 0.32). The Angstrom exponent (α) for post-monsoon and winter are found to be 1.08 ± 0.10 and 1.11 ± 0.16 respectively. During the monitoring period, the majority of AOD values (47%) are above 0.60, indicating moderately polluted conditions in the region. Anthropogenic, biomass burning, and mixed aerosols are identified as the prevalent aerosol types in the study region. The observed aerosol classification is also explained in terms of CAMS near-real-time model datasets. The AOD values retrieved by MODIS, VIIRS, Himawari-8, and CAMS show a good correlation with the observed Microtops AOD with R2 values ranging from 0.60 to 0.94. Moreover, different MODIS aerosol products (DB, DT, and combined DB-DT) are evaluated based on a comparison of Collection 6.1 AOD with the ground truth obtained from Microtops. The spatial distribution of AOD as observed by various satellites are compared and the vertical distribution of aerosol is also explained with the extinction coefficient provided by the CALIOP lidar onboard CALIPSO and aerosol types provided by CAMS. © The Author(s).",yes,No,No,Yes
The role of sources and meteorology in driving PM2.5-bound chlorine,"The role of chloride in atmospheric chemistry received increased attention over recent years. Given the primary and chemical-active nature of PM2.5-bound chlorine (p-Cl-), it makes sense to get to know the sources and processes of p-Cl-. The temporal behavior of observed p-Cl- concentration based on 1-h high resolution exhibited seasonal variation of high in winter, low in summer and diurnal variation of high in the morning, low in afternoon. Meteorological normalization technique based on random forest was used to disentangle the effects of emission changes which affected the seasonal variation and meteorology which was related to diurnal variation on p-Cl-. Generalized additive model (GAM) identified RH and temperature as the key meteorological factors of p-Cl- generation, and p-Cl- pollution was serious under the condition of low temperature and high RH. Dispersion-normalized positive matrix factorization (DN-PMF) was used to apportion the p-Cl- to its sources, finding that coal combustion was the main source of p-Cl-, followed by biomass burning and industrial process emissions. Our results will provide the basis for further analysis the causes of p-Cl- pollution and composite air pollution control strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",no,No,No,No
"An evaluation of biomass burning aerosol mass, extinction, and size distribution in GEOS using observations from CAMP2Ex","Biomass burning aerosol impacts aspects of the atmosphere and Earth system through direct and semi-direct effects, as well as influencing air quality. Despite its importance, the representation of biomass burning aerosol is not always accurate in numerical weather prediction and climate models or reanalysis products. Using observations collected as part of the Cloud, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex) in August through October of 2019, aerosol concentration and optical properties are evaluated within the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) and its underlying aerosol module, GOCART. In the operational configuration, GEOS assimilates aerosol optical depth observations at 550nm from AERONET and MODIS to constrain aerosol fields. Particularly for biomass burning aerosol, without the assimilation of aerosol optical depth, aerosol extinction is underestimated compared to observations collected in the Philippines region during the CAMP2Ex campaign. The assimilation process adds excessive amounts of carbon to account for the underestimated extinction, resulting in positive biases in the mass of black and organic carbon, especially within the boundary layer, relative to in situ observations from the Langley Aerosol Research Group Experiment. Counteracting this, GEOS is deficient in sulfate and nitrate aerosol just above the boundary layer. Aerosol extinction within GEOS is a function of the mass of different aerosol species, the ambient relative humidity, the assumed spectral optical properties, and particle size distribution per species. The relationship between dry and ambient extinction in GEOS reveals that hygroscopic growth is too high within the model for biomass burning aerosol. An additional concern lies in the assumed particle size distribution for GEOS, which has a single mode radius that is too small for organic carbon. Variability in the observed particle size distribution for biomass burning aerosol within a single flight also illuminates the fact that a single assumed particle size distribution is not sufficient and that for a proper representation, a more advanced aerosol module within GEOS may be necessary. © 2022 Copernicus GmbH.

The volatility of pollen extracts and their main constituents in aerosolized form via the integrated volume method (IVM) and the volatility basis set (VBS),"The volatility of organic aerosol in the atmosphere is an important quality that determines the aerosol/gas partitioning of compounds in the atmosphere and thus influences their ability to participate in gas-phase reactions in the atmosphere. In this research, the volatility of biological aerosols, specifically water-soluble pollen extracts and their chemical constituents, are studied for important thermodynamic properties such as saturation vapor concentration and latent heat of vaporization. The integrated volume method (IVM) was applied to characterize these properties for various free amino acids and saccharides in pollen, and the volatility basis set (VBS) approach was utilized to obtain a distribution of the mass fraction of pollen extracts with respect to saturation vapor concentration. Our results indicate that among seven compounds tested with the IVM, proline, γ-aminobutyric acid, and fructose had semivolatile saturation vapor concentrations of 17.5 ± 2.2, 14.7 ± 0.8, and 4.4 ± 0.5 μg m−3, respectively. Additionally, our VBS measurements indicate that aspen pollen extract contains a greater semivolatile mass fraction (up to 8.5% of total water-soluble mass) than lodgepole pine pollen (up to 2.2%), indicating that different pollen species may contribute to the total atmospheric semivolatile organic compound (SVOC) and low volatile organic compound (LVOC) budgets differently. Depending on estimates of several factors, fluxes and concentrations of SVOCs and LVOCs from pollen could be comparable to other sources such as biomass burning and ambient urban emissions, though further research is needed to better constrain the contribution of pollen and other bioaerosols to organic compounds in the atmosphere. © 2023 The Author(s).

A Study of Erythrocyte Deformation Level Related to Biomass Burning Emission Exposures Using Artificial Neural Networks,"Emissions from burning biomass have become a problem in Indonesia. As found on the Indonesian island of Lombok, agricultural waste is burned for traditional industrial activities. On the other hand, biomass burning emissions contain many PMs (particulates) in different size distributions recognized to have a significant correlation to health impact. This study is conducted to predict the impact of the PM exposure on blood using a ANN (artificial neural network) model as well as a histological examination. The relationship between both methods is determined to estimate the impact of biomass burning emissions on the blood. This study used male mice as the experimental animals exposed to PM emissions (PM0.1, PM2.5, and PM10) produced from the burning of various biomass (rice straw, rice husks, corn cobs, corn stalks, and tobacco) taken from Lombok Island. The sample exposure was conducted in a chamber for 100 s for ten sequence days. The blood samples were observed using a microscope with the 400 x magnification. The cell deformation was examined histologically by calculating the normal and abnormal cells. The percentage of the erythrocyte deformation was assessed using a fixed back and forth propagation ANN. The result shows that the biomass burning PM emissions have a significant impact on the erythrocyte deformation depending on the type of biomass and the particulate matter emissions. The ANN model confirms the erythrocyte deformation data obtained by the histological examination method. © 2022, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved.",yes,No,No,Yes
Associations between long-term exposures to airborne PM2.5 components and mortality in Massachusetts: mixture analysis exploration,"Background:: Numerous studies have documented PM2.5’s links with adverse health outcomes. Comparatively fewer studies have evaluated specific PM2.5 components. The lack of exposure measurements and high correlation among different PM2.5 components are two limitations. Methods:: We applied a novel exposure prediction model to obtain annual Census tract-level concentrations of 15 PM2.5 components (Zn, V, Si, Pb, Ni, K, Fe, Cu, Ca, Br, SO42−, NO3−, NH4+, OC, EC) in Massachusetts from 2000 to 2015, to which we matched geocoded deaths. All non-accidental mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and respiratory mortality were examined for the population aged 18 or over. Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression models were used to examine the cumulative associations between PM2.5 components mixture and outcomes and each component’s contributions to the cumulative associations. We have fit WQS models on 15 PM2.5 components and a priori identified source groups (heavy fuel oil combustion, biomass burning, crustal matter, non-tailpipe traffic source, tailpipe traffic source, secondary particles from power plants, secondary particles from agriculture, unclear source) for the 15 PM2.5 components. Total PM2.5 mass analysis and single component associations were also conducted through quasi-Poisson regression models. Results:: Positive cumulative associations between the components mixture and all three outcomes were observed from the WQS models. Components with large contribution to the cumulative associations included K, OC, and Fe. Biomass burning, traffic emissions, and secondary particles from power plants were identified as important source contributing to the cumulative associations. Mortality rate ratios for cardiovascular mortality were of greater magnitude than all non-accidental mortality and respiratory mortality, which is also observed in cumulative associations estimated from WQS, total PM2.5 mass analysis, and single component associations. Conclusion:: We have found positive associations between the mixture of 15 PM2.5 components and all non-accidental mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and respiratory mortality. Among these components, Fe, K, and OC have been identified as having important contribution to the cumulative associations. The WQS results also suggests potential source effects from biomass burning, traffic emissions, and secondary particles from power plants. © 2022, The Author(s).",yes,No,No,Yes
Rate of atmospheric brown carbon whitening governed by environmental conditions,"Biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) in the atmosphere contains many compounds that absorb solar radiation, called brown carbon (BrC). While BBOA is in the atmosphere, BrC can undergo reactions with oxidants such as ozone which decrease absorbance, or whiten. The effect of temperature and relative humidity (RH) on whitening has not been well constrained, leading to uncertainties when predicting the direct radiative effect of BrC on climate. Using an aerosol flow-tube reactor, we show that the whitening of BBOA by oxidation with ozone is strongly dependent on RH and temperature. Using a poke-flow technique, we show that the viscosity of BBOA also depends strongly on these conditions. The measured whitening rate of BrC is described well with the viscosity data, assuming that the whitening is due to oxidation occurring in the bulk of the BBOA, within a thin shell beneath the surface. Using our combined datasets, we developed a kinetic model of this whitening process, and we show that the lifetime of BrC is 1 d or less below ∼1 km in altitude in the atmosphere but is often much longer than 1 d above this altitude. Including this altitude dependence of the whitening rate in a chemical transport model causes a large change in the predicted warming effect of BBOA on climate. Overall, the results illustrate that RH and temperature need to be considered to understand the role of BBOA in the atmosphere. Copyright © 2022 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.",no,No,No,No
Towards sector-based attribution using intra-city variations in satellite-based emission ratios between CO2 and CO,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO) are co-emitted by many combustion sources. Previous efforts have combined satellite-based observations of multiple tracers to calculate their emission ratio (ER) for inferring combustion efficiency at the regional to city scale. Very few studies have focused on combustion efficiency at the sub-city scale or related it to emission sectors using space-based observations. Several factors are important for interpreting and deriving spatially resolved ERs from asynchronous satellite measurements, including (1) variations in meteorological conditions given the mismatch in satellite overpass times, (2) differences in vertical sensitivity of the retrievals (i.e., averaging kernel profiles), (3) interferences from the biosphere and biomass burning, and (4) the mismatch in the daytime variations of CO and CO2 emissions. In this study, we extended an established emission estimate approach to arrive at spatially resolved ERs based on retrieved column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) from the Snapshot Area Mapping (SAM) mode of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) and column-averaged CO from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). To evaluate the influences of the confounding factors listed above and further attribute intra-urban variations in ERs to certain sectors, we leveraged a Lagrangian atmospheric transport model with an urban land cover classification dataset and reported ERCO values from the sounding level to the overpass and city level. We found that the differences in overpass times and averaging kernels between OCO and TROPOMI strongly affect the estimated spatially resolved ERCO. Specifically, a time difference of >3 h typically led to dramatic changes in wind directions and urban plume shapes, thereby making the calculation of accurate sounding-specific ERCO difficult. After removing such cases from consideration and applying a simple plume shift method when necessary to account for changes in wind direction and speed, we discovered significant contrasts in combustion efficiencies between (1) two megacities versus two industry-oriented cities and (2) different regions within a city, based on six nearly coincident overpasses per city. Results suggest that the ERCO impacted by heavy industry in Los Angeles is slightly lower than the overall city-wide value (<10 ppb-CO/ppm-CO2). In contrast, the ERCO related to heavy industry in Shanghai is much higher than Shanghai's city mean and more aligned with the city means of two selected industry-oriented cities in China (approaching 20 ppb-CO/ppm-CO2). Although investigations based on a larger number of satellite overpasses are needed, our unique approach (i.e., without using sector-specific information from emission inventories) provides new insights into assessing combustion efficiency within a city from future satellite missions, such as those that will map column CO2 and CO concentrations simultaneously with high spatiotemporal resolutions.

Large sub-regional differences of ammonia seasonal patterns over India reveal inventory discrepancies,"Ammonia (NH3) is a key precursor of haze particles and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its spatiotemporal variabilities are poorly constrained. In this study, we present measurements of NH3 over the Indian subcontinent region from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI) and Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) satellite instruments. This region exhibits a complex emission profile due to the number of varied sources, including crop burning, fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer application, livestock and industrial sources. Observations from the CrIS and IASI instruments are oversampled to a resolution of 0.02° × 0.02°. Five regions with distinct spatiotemporal NH3 profiles are determined using k-means clustering. Maximum NH3 columns are seen in July over the western India with column densities of 6.2 × 1017 mol cm−2 and 7.2 × 1017 mol cm−2 respectively for IASI and CrIS. The seasonality of measured NH3 columns show annual maxima occurring in spring in Eastern India and Bangladesh and in mid-summer for the western Indo-Gangetic plain. Our observational constraints suggest that the impact of local farming practices on NH3 emissions is not well captured in emission inventories such as Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), which exhibits peaks in the late spring and autumn. The spatial variability in the seasonal patterns of NH3 is also not captured by the single emissions profile used in CMIP6 for India. The high-resolution maps obtained from these measurements can be used to improve NH3 emission inventories in order to understand its sources for more accurate predictions of air quality in the Indian subcontinent. Our study points to the need for regionally specific emissions inventories for short-lived species such as NH3 that have heterogeneous emissions profiles due to specific agricultural practices and other emission source characteristics. © 2022 The Author(s).

Characterization of the lung microbiome and inflammatory cytokine levels in women exposed to environmental risk factors: A pilot study,"Introduction: Lung microbiome dysbiosis affects the immune system balance and promotes lung inflammation. We aimed to characterize and compare the lung bacteriome composition and the cytokine profile in women with normal lung function exposed to risk factors for chronic lung diseases (tobacco smoking and biomass-burning smoke exposure). Methods: We included women with biomass-burning smoke exposure (BE, n = 11) and current smokers women (TS, n = 10). The bacteriome composition was performed in induced sputum, sequencing the 16 rRNA gene. Cytokine levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay multiplex assay in the supernatant of induced sputum. For quantitative variables, we used medians and minimum and maxim values. For the amplicon sequence variants (ASV) differential abundance testing between groups. Results: At the taxa level, the phylum Proteobacteria was found in a higher proportion in the TS group concerning BE (p =.045); however, after the false discovery rate adjustment, this difference was not retained (p =.288). We found a higher concentration of IL-1β in the TS group than in the BE group (248.6 vs. 177.9 pg/mL, p =.010). Women with high biomass-burning smoke exposure in an hour per day had a positive correlation with the abundance of Bacteroidota (ρ = 0.71, p =.014) and Fusobacteriota (ρ = 0.73, p =.011). FEV1/FVC had a positive correlation with an abundance of Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria (ρ = 0.74, p =.009, ρ = 0.85, p =.001, and ρ = 0.83, p =.001, respectively). In tobacco smoking, women had a positive correlation (ρ = 0.77, p =.009) between cigarettes per day and Firmicutes' abundance. Conclusion: Compared to biomass-burning smoke-exposed women, current smokers have poor lung function and high levels of IL-1β in sputum. Women with biomass-burning smoke exposure present an increased abundance of Bacteroidota and Fusobacteriota. © 2023 The Authors.

Insights into aerosol chemical composition and optical properties at Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (2862 m asl) during two contrasting seasons,"Continental outflows from peninsular Southeast Asia and East Asia dominate the widespread dispersal of air pollutants over subtropical western North Pacific during spring and autumn, respectively. This study analyses the chemical composition and optical properties of PM10 aerosols during autumn and spring at a representative high-altitude site, viz., Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (23.47°N, 120.87°E; 2862 m a.s.l.), Taiwan. PM10 mass was reconstructed and the contributions of major chemical components were also delineated. Aerosol scattering (σsp) and absorption (σap) coefficients were regressed on mass densities of major chemical components by assuming external mixing between them, and the site-specific mass scattering efficiency (MSE) and mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of individual components for dry conditions were determined. NH4NO3 exhibited the highest MSE among all components during both seasons (8.40 and 12.58 m2 g−1 at 550 nm in autumn and spring, respectively). (NH4)2SO4 and organic matter (OM) accounted for the highest σsp during autumn (51%) and spring (50%), respectively. Mean MAE (mean contribution to σap) of elemental carbon (EC) at 550 nm was 2.51 m2 g−1 (36%) and 7.30 m2 g−1 (61%) in autumn and spring, respectively. Likewise, the mean MAE (mean contribution to σap) of organic carbon (OC) at 550 nm was 0.84 m2 g−1 (64%) and 0.83 m2 g−1 (39%) in autumn and spring, respectively. However, a classification matrix, based on scattering Ångström exponent, absorption Ångström exponent, and single scattering albedo (ω), demonstrated that the composite absorbing aerosols were EC-dominated (with weak absorption; ω = 0.91–0.95) in autumn and a combination of EC-dominated and EC/OC mixture (with moderate absorption; ω = 0.85–0.92) in spring. This study demonstrates a strong link between chemical composition and optical properties of aerosol and provides essential information for model simulations to assess the imbalance in regional radiation budget with better accuracy over the western North Pacific. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",no,No,No,No
Suitability of band angle indices for burned area mapping in the Maule Region (Chile),"In January 2017, 114 active fires burned throughout Chile at the same time. These fires spread quickly due to high temperatures, fast dry winds, and low vegetation water content. The fire events burned more than 570,000 ha, from which 20% of the area was endangered native forest. Timely and accurate burned area mapping is crucial for the evaluation of damages and management of the affected areas. As Chile is a diverse country with many types of ecosystems and vegetation, the use of novel spectral indices may improve the accuracy of satellite data-based burned area mapping algorithms. In this study, we explored the contribution of band angle indices (BAnI) to burned area mapping. The BAnI are based on trigonometric equations that proved to be sensitive to moisture conditions. Then, we aimed to test their sensitivity to the burned area spectral signature. We used Sentinel-2 data at 20 m resolution to calibrate and implement a random forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE) computing platform. We ran the RF classifier with and without BAnI to evaluate their potential to identify burned areas and performed two accuracy assessments comparing the results with visually digitized fire perimeters from (1) WorldView 3 (WV3) images, and (2) Sentinel at 10 m resolution. We determined that both BA classifications were more accurate than the perimeters created by the Chilean National Forest Corporation (CONAF), which overestimates the area burnt. The overestimation of CONAF perimeters is produced by considering as burned the inner unburned areas and omitting some small, burned areas. The first assessment showed no significant differences between the two RF classifications. However, the second validation showed lower omission and commission errors for the RF classifier with the BAnI (5 and 17.8%, respectively). On the other hand, comparing both BA classifications with and without BAnI, we observed differences in the spatial distribution of the errors. However, the RF classification with BAnI offered fewer commission errors located in agricultural areas. The burned area algorithms developed in GEE showed their potential to map the fire-affected area quickly, efficiently, and accurately, accounting for all the areas burned in the season, including the small and agricultural fires the official perimeters did not consider.

Atmospheric OH reactivity in the western United States determined from comprehensive gas-phase measurements during WE-CAN,"Wildfire smoke contains numerous different reactive organic gases, many of which have only recently been identified and quantified. Consequently, their relative importance as an oxidant sink is poorly constrained, resulting in incomplete representation in both global chemical transport models (CTMs) and explicit chemical mechanisms. Leveraging 160 gas-phase measurements made during the Western Wildfire Experiment for Cloud Chemistry, Aerosol Absorption, and Nitrogen (WE-CAN) aircraft campaign, we calculate OH reactivities (OHRs) for western U.S. wildfire emissions, smoke aged >3 days, smoke-impacted and low/no smoke-impacted urban atmospheres, and the clean free troposphere. VOCs were found to account for ~80% of the total calculated OHR in wildfire emissions, with at least half of the field VOC OHR not currently implemented for biomass burning (BB) emissions in the commonly used GEOS-Chem CTM. To improve the representation of OHR, we recommend CTMs implement furan-containing species, butadienes, and monoterpenes for BB. The Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) was found to account for 88% of VOC OHR in wildfire emissions and captures its observed decay in the first few hours of aging, indicating that most known VOC OH sinks are included in the explicit mechanisms. We find BB smoke enhanced the average total OHR by 53% relative to the low/no smoke urban background, mainly due to the increase in VOCs and CO thus promoting urban ozone production. This work highlights the most important VOC species for daytime BB plume oxidation and provides a roadmap for which species should be prioritized in next-generation CTMs to better predict the downwind air quality and health impacts of BB smoke. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Trends in sedimentary charcoal shapes correspond with broad-scale land-use changes: insights gained from a 300-year lake sediment record from eastern Virginia, USA","Sedimentary charcoal is a useful fire proxy. Recent advances in the morphological and morphometric analyses of individual charcoal particles have enabled more nuanced paleofire interpretations. However, many uncertainties exist regarding the linkages of these particle characteristics with fuel type burned. Further, most of this proxy development research has been conducted in northern boreal biomes, which poses questions as to its universality. In this paper, we leverage a 300-year sediment record from a mill pond in southeastern Virginia, USA. Historical events and land-use changes are well constrained in Williamsburg, allowing us to compare our data with these known boundary conditions to (1) make inferences about the fuel sourcing of certain charcoal morphotypes, and (2) identify the potential controls of several charcoal morphometric characteristics. We found that the morphology and morphometry of particles in the Matoaka sediments changed in response to broad-scale shifts of historical land use and population. Prior to the American Revolutionary War (ca. 1780 CE), charcoal morphologies indicative of agricultural burning coincided with agricultural and local population expansion. Immediately preceding the American Civil War (1780–1865 CE), charcoal in Lake Matoaka recorded reforestation driven by depopulation and economic depression. After the fall of the Confederacy (ca. 1865 CE), changing charcoal morphologies reflected increased population and urban development. This increase became especially pronounced in the early 1900s, but lasted until the modern. Additionally, shifts of charcoal morphologies potentially reflect increased coal combustion. Comparison of these historical variations with morphotype shifts shows that Types M and S/B charcoal, types defined by their geometric shapes and exhibition of structure, are likely sourced from burning herbaceous fuels. However, we find that the variability of morphometric characteristics makes it unlikely that other morphologies are sourced from sole fuel types. Lastly, we propose three additional morphotypes, Types AI (angular and irregular shaped particles), E (irregular, complex shaped particles), and T (triangular particles), to an existing charcoal morphological key for application in the SE USA. Overall, this research underscores the need for more work calibrating paleofire methodologies in the SE USA. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",no,No,No,No
Arctic spring and summertime aerosol optical depth baseline from long-term observations and model reanalyses - Part 1: Climatology and trend,"We present an Arctic aerosol optical depth (AOD) climatology and trend analysis for 2003-2019 spring and summertime periods derived from a combination of multi-agency aerosol reanalyses, remote-sensing retrievals, and ground observations. This includes the U.S. Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System ReAnalysis version 1 (NAAPS-RA v1), the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ReAnalysis (CAMSRA). Spaceborne remote-sensing retrievals of AOD are considered from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Ground-based data include sun photometer data from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites and oceanic Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) measurements. Aerosol reanalysis AODs and spaceborne retrievals show consistent climatological spatial patterns and trends for both spring and summer seasons over the lower Arctic (60-70N). Consistent AOD trends are also found for the high Arctic (north of 70° N) from reanalyses. The aerosol reanalyses yield more consistent AOD results than climate models, can be verified well with AERONET, and corroborate complementary climatological and trend analysis. Speciated AODs are more variable than total AOD among the three reanalyses and a little more so for March-May (MAM) than for June-August (JJA). Black carbon (BC) AOD in the Arctic comes predominantly from biomass burning (BB) sources in both MAM and JJA, and BB overwhelms anthropogenic sources in JJA for the study period. AOD exhibits a multi-year negative MAM trend and a positive JJA trend in the Arctic during 2003-2019, due to an overall decrease in sulfate/anthropogenic pollution and a significant JJA increase in BB smoke. Interannual Arctic AOD variability is significantly large, driven by fine-mode and, specifically, BB smoke, with both smoke contribution and interannual variation larger in JJA than in MAM. It is recommended that climate models should account for BB emissions and BB interannual variabilities and trends in Arctic climate change studies. © 2022 Peng Xian et al.",no,No,No,No
Seasonal cycles and long-term trends of arctic tropospheric aerosols based on CALIPSO lidar observations,"Notable warming trends have been observed in the Arctic, with tropospheric aerosols being one of the key drivers. Here the seasonal cycles of three-dimensional (3D) distributions of aerosol extinction coefficients (AECs) and frequency of occurrences (FoOs) for different aerosol subtypes in the troposphere over the Arctic from 2007 to 2019 are characterized capitalizing on Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) Level-3 gridded aerosol profile product. Seasonal contributions of total and type-dependent aerosols through their partitioning within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free troposphere (FT) are also quantified utilizing the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) PBL height data. The results show substantial seasonal and geographical dependence in the distribution of aerosols over the Arctic. Sulfate, black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) contribute most of the total AEC, with Eurasia being the largest contributor. The vertical structure of AECs and FoOs over the Arctic demonstrates that the vertical influence of aerosols is higher in eastern Siberia and North America than in northern Eurasia and its coasts. When the total aerosol optical depth (TAOD) is partitioned into the PBL and FT, results indicate that the contributions of TAOD within the FT tend to be more significant, especially in summer, with the FT contributes 64.2% and 69.2% of TAOD over the lower (i.e., 60° N–70° N) and high (i.e., north of 70° N) Arctic, respectively. Additionally, seasonal trend analyses suggest Arctic TAOD exhibits a multi-year negative trend in winter, spring, and autumn and a positive trend in summer during 2007–2019, due to an overall decrease in sulfate from weakened anthropogenic emissions and a significant increase in BC and OC from enhanced biomass burning activities. Overall, this study has potential implications for understanding the seasonal cycles and trends in Arctic aerosols. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",yes,No,No,Yes
Black carbon in different climatic seasons of the Brahmaputra River Valley of Northeast India – Field measurements at two different heights and analysis,"The subsequent climate-forcing pollutant to carbon dioxide, black carbon (BC) impacts air quality at local to global scales. Its increasing concentration is worrisome in the hilly regions of the Brahmaputra River Valley of Northeast India due to its proximity to the Himalayas. The unprecedented growth in vehicular population and biomass burning are the prime sources. This study analyzes the BC concentrations measured at ten strategic locations in Guwahati for one year from August 2016 to July 2017, covering the four climatic seasons. Five monitoring stations were at a breathing level of 1.5 m, and another five were at a higher level of 15 m. The research determines the effect of the spatial heterogeneity and the hill-effected local wind-flow pattern on BC's relationship at two different heights. The results show that the temporal variation of BC concentrations at higher levels followed the traffic pattern's temporal variation. The local meteorological fluctuations at breathing height interfere with this relationship, affecting the performance of most air dispersion models near traffic intersections or roadways. When compared, the reduction in BC between the two heights showed the highest in monsoon (14.5 ± 6.4 μg m−3) and the lowest in winter (5.8 ± 5.5 μg m−3). With Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Bland-Altman Plots, BC's relationship between higher and lower heights was reasonably good for pre-monsoon and poor for monsoon. The average BC concentration at breathing level was 22 ± 11.3 μg m−3, and at the higher level, it was 11.5 ± 5.2 μg m−3. © 2022 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",yes,No,No,Yes
Sensitivity of biomass burning emissions estimates to land surface information,"Emissions from biomass burning (BB) are a key source of atmospheric tracer gases that affect the atmospheric carbon cycle. We developed four sets of global BB emissions estimates (named GlcGlob, GlcGeoc, McdGlob, and McdGeoc) using a bottom-up approach and by combining the remote sensing products related to fire distribution with two aboveground biomass (AGB) and two land cover classification (LCC) distributions. The sensitivity of the estimates of BB emissions to the AGB and LCC data was evaluated using the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions associated with each BB estimate. Using the AGB and/or LCC data led to substantially different spatial estimates of CO emissions, with a large (factor of approximately 3) spread of estimates for the mean annual CO emissions: 526±53, 219±35, 624±57, and 293±44gTggCOgyr-1 for GlcGlob, GlcGeoc, McdGlob, and McdGeoc, respectively, and 415±47gTggCOgyr-1 for their ensemble average (EsmAve). We simulated atmospheric CO variability at an approximately 2.5g grid using an atmospheric tracer transport model and the BB emissions estimates and compared it with ground-based and satellite observations. At ground-based observation sites during fire seasons, the impact of intermittent fire events was poorly defined in our simulations due to the coarse resolution, which obscured temporal and spatial variability in the simulated atmospheric CO concentration. However, when compared at the regional and global scales, the distribution of atmospheric CO concentrations in the simulations shows substantial differences among the estimates of BB emissions. These results indicate that the estimates of BB emissions are highly sensitive to the AGB and LCC data. © 2022 Makoto Saito et al.",yes,No,No,Yes
"Variations in the concentration, source activity, and atmospheric processing of PM2.5-associated water-soluble ionic species over Jammu, India","Concentrations, sources, and atmospheric processing of water-soluble ionic species associated with PM2.5 collected from 2015 to 2017 were studied in Jammu, an urban location in the North-Western Himalayan Region (NWHR). Being ecologically sensitive and sparsely studied for dynamics in PM2.5 and associated WSIS, the present study is important for developing robust air pollution abatement strategies for the air-shed of NWHR. Twenty-four hourly PM2.5 samples were collected on weekly basis at a receptor site and analyzed for WSIS using ion chromatography system. On annual basis, total sum of WSIS (ΣWSIS) contributed about 28.5% of PM2.5, where the contribution of sulfate-nitrate-ammonium, a proxy for secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA), was found to be 18.7% of PM2.5. The ΣWSIS and PM2.5 concentration showed a seasonal cycle with the maximum concentration during winters and the minimum in summers. Mass fraction of ΣWSIS in PM2.5 showed an anti-phase seasonal pattern indicating more source activity during summers. Season-wise, dominant WSIS constituting PM2.5 were NO3−, SO42−, NH4+, and K+ during winters; whereas summer was marked with dominant contributions from SO42−, NH4+, Ca2+, and K+. Seasonal variability exhibited among SIA constituents underscored the crucial role of air temperature and relative humidity regime. It was observed that nss-K+ + NH4+ were sufficient to neutralize most of the acidic species arising from precursor gases (NOx and SOx). Using principal component analysis, five major sources and processes, viz. (a) biomass burning activities, (b) secondary inorganic aerosol formation, (c) input from re-suspended dust, (d) transported dust, and (e) fertilizer residue, were identified for the emissions of PM2.5-associated WSIS over Jammu. In future studies, impacts of dry and/or wet deposition of aerosol-associated WSIS on the crop productivity in the region should be studied. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",yes,No,No,Yes
"Arctic spring and summertime aerosol optical depth baseline from long-term observations and model reanalyses - Part 2: Statistics of extreme AOD events, and implications for the impact of regional biomass burning processes","In a companion paper (Xian et al., 2022, part 1 of the study), we present an Arctic aerosol optical depth (AOD) climatology and trend analysis for 2003-2019 spring and summertime periods derived from a combination of aerosol reanalyses, remote-sensing retrievals, and ground observations. Continued from the previous discussion and as the second part of the study, we report the statistics and trends of Arctic AOD extreme events using the U.S. Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System ReAnalysis version 1 (NAAPS-RA v1), the sun photometer data from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites, and the oceanic Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) measurements. Here, extreme AOD events are defined as events with AOD exceeding the 95th percentile (denoted ""AOD95"") of AOD distributions for given locations using 6-hourly or daily AOD data. While AERONET and MAN data estimate the Arctic median 550 nm AOD value to be 0.07, the 95th percentile value is 0.24. Such extreme events are dominated by fine-mode aerosol particles, largely attributable to biomass burning (BB) smoke events for the North American Arctic, the Asian Arctic, and most areas of the Arctic Ocean. However, extreme AOD events for the lower European Arctic are more attributable to anthropogenic and biogenic fine particles. The extreme-event occurrence dominance of sea salt is largely limited to the North Atlantic and Norwegian Sea. The extreme AOD amplitudes of anthropogenic and biogenic fine-mode and sea salt AOD are, however, significantly lower than those regions where extreme smoke AOD is dominant. Even for sites distant from BB source regions, BB smoke is the principal driver of AOD variation above the AOD95 threshold. Maximum AOD values in the high Arctic in 2010-2019 have increased compared to 2003-2009, indicating stronger extreme BB smoke influence in more recent years. The occurrence of extreme smoke events tended to be more equally distributed over all months (April-August) during the 2003-2009 period while being more concentrated in the late season (July-August) during the 2010-2019 period. The temporal shift of the occurrence of AOD extreme events is likely due to improved control of early-season agriculture burning, climate-change-related increases in summertime lightning frequencies, and a reduction in anthropogenic pollution over the 2010-2019 period. © 2022 Peng Xian et al.",no,No,No,No
An Application of Artificial Neural Network to Evaluate the Influence of Weather Conditions on the Variation of PM2.5-Bound Carbonaceous Compositions and Water-Soluble Ionic Species,"Previous studies have determined biomass burning as a major source of air pollutants in the ambient air in Thailand. To analyse the impacts of meteorological parameters on the variation of carbonaceous aerosols and water-soluble ionic species (WSIS), numerous statistical models, including a source apportionment analysis with the assistance of principal component analysis (PCA), hierar-chical cluster analysis (HCA), and artificial neural networks (ANNs), were employed in this study. A total of 191 sets of PM2.5 samples were collected from the three monitoring stations in Chiang-Mai, Bangkok, and Phuket from July 2020 to June 2021. Hotspot numbers and other meteorological parameters were obtained using NOAA-20 weather satellites coupled with the Global Land Data Assimilation System. Although PCA revealed that crop residue burning and wildfires are the two main sources of PM2.5, ANNs highlighted the importance of wet deposition as the main depletion mechanism of particulate WSIS and carbonaceous aerosols. Additionally, Mg2+ and Ca2+ were deeply connected with albedo, plausibly owing to their strong hygroscopicity as the CCNs responsible for cloud formation. © 2022 by the authors.

Augmenting Heritage Ocean-Color Aerosol Models for Enhanced Remote Sensing of Inland and Nearshore Coastal Waters,"Satellite remote sensing of near-surface water composition in terrestrial and coastal regions is challenging largely due to uncertainties linked to a lack of representative continental aerosols in the atmospheric correction (AC) framework. A comprehensive family of absorbing aerosols is proposed by analyzing global AERONET measurements using the Partition Around Medoids (PAM) classifier. The input to the classifier is composed of Version 3, Level 2.0 daily average aerosol properties [i.e., single scattering albedo at λ = 0.44 μm, (SSA(0.44)) and the Angstrom exponents for extinction and absorption AEe(0.44–0.87) and AEa(0.44–0.87), respectively from observations from June 1993 to September 2019. The PAM classification based on low daily aerosol optical depth (AOD(0.44) ≤ 0.4) suggested 27 distinct aerosol clusters encompassing five major absorbing aerosol types (Dust (DU), Marine (MAR), Mixed (MIX), Urban/Industrial (U/I), and Biomass Burning (BB)). Seasonal patterns of dominant PAM-derived clusters at three AERONET sites (GSFC, Kanpur, and Banizoumbou) strongly influenced by U/I, DU, and BB types, respectively, showed a satisfactory agreement with variations of aerosol mixtures reported in the literature. These PAM-derived models augment the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) aerosol models (A2010) applied in its operational AC. To demonstrate the validity and complementary nature of our models, a coupled ocean-atmosphere radiative transfer code is employed to create a simulated dataset for developing two experimental machine-learning AC processors. These two processors differ only in their aerosol models used in training: 1) a processor trained with the A2010 aerosol models (ACI) and 2) a processor trained with both PAM and A2010 aerosol models (ACII). These processors are applied to Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) matchups (N = 173) from selected AERONET sites equipped with ocean color radiometers (AERONET-OC). Our assessments showed improvements of up to 30% in retrieving remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in the blue bands. In general, our empirically derived PAM aerosol models complement A2010 models (designed for regions strongly influenced by marine conditions) over continental and coastal waters where absorbing aerosols are present (e.g., urban environments, areas impacted by dust, or wildfire events). With the expected geographic expansion of in situ aquatic validation networks (e.g., AERONET-OC), the advantages of our models will be accentuated, particularly in the ultraviolet and short blue bands.

"Winter brown carbon over six of China's megacities: Light absorption, molecular characterization, and improved source apportionment revealed by multilayer perceptron neural network","Brown carbon (BrC) constitutes a large fraction of organic carbon and exhibits strong light absorption properties, thus affecting the global radiation budget. In this study, we investigated the light absorption properties, chemical functional bonds, and sources of BrC in six megacities in China, namely Beijing, Harbin, Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Wuhan. The average values of the BrC light absorption coefficient and the mass absorption efficiency at 365gnm in northern cities were higher than those in southern cities by 2.5 and 1.8 times, respectively, demonstrating the abundance of BrC present in northern China's megacities. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra revealed sharp and intense peaks at 1640, 1458-1385, and 1090-1030gcm-1, which were ascribed to aromatic phenols, confirming the contribution of primary emission sources (e.g., biomass burning and coal combustion) to BrC. In addition, we noted peaks at 860, 1280-1260, and 1640gcm-1, which were attributed to organonitrate and oxygenated phenolic groups, indicating that secondary BrC also existed in the six megacities. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) coupled with multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network analysis was used to apportion the sources of BrC light absorption. The results showed that primary emissions (e.g., biomass burning, tailpipe emissions, and coal combustion) made a major contribution to BrC in the six megacities. However, secondary formation processes made a greater contribution to light absorption in the southern cities (17.9g%-21.2g%) than in the northern cities (2.1g%-10.2g%). These results can provide a basis for the more effective control of BrC to reduce its impacts on regional climates and human health. © 2022 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.",yes,No,No,Yes
European aerosol phenomenology − 8: Harmonised source apportionment of organic aerosol using 22 Year-long ACSM/AMS datasets,"Organic aerosol (OA) is a key component of total submicron particulate matter (PM1), and comprehensive knowledge of OA sources across Europe is crucial to mitigate PM1 levels. Europe has a well-established air quality research infrastructure from which yearlong datasets using 21 aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSMs) and 1 aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were gathered during 2013–2019. It includes 9 non-urban and 13 urban sites. This study developed a state-of-the-art source apportionment protocol to analyse long-term OA mass spectrum data by applying the most advanced source apportionment strategies (i.e., rolling PMF, ME-2, and bootstrap). This harmonised protocol was followed strictly for all 22 datasets, making the source apportionment results more comparable. In addition, it enables quantification of the most common OA components such as hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), cooking-like OA (COA), more oxidised-oxygenated OA (MO-OOA), and less oxidised-oxygenated OA (LO-OOA). Other components such as coal combustion OA (CCOA), solid fuel OA (SFOA: mainly mixture of coal and peat combustion), cigarette smoke OA (CSOA), sea salt (mostly inorganic but part of the OA mass spectrum), coffee OA, and ship industry OA could also be separated at a few specific sites. Oxygenated OA (OOA) components make up most of the submicron OA mass (average = 71.1%, range from 43.7 to 100%). Solid fuel combustion-related OA components (i.e., BBOA, CCOA, and SFOA) are still considerable with in total 16.0% yearly contribution to the OA, yet mainly during winter months (21.4%). Overall, this comprehensive protocol works effectively across all sites governed by different sources and generates robust and consistent source apportionment results. Our work presents a comprehensive overview of OA sources in Europe with a unique combination of high time resolution (30–240 min) and long-term data coverage (9–36 months), providing essential information to improve/validate air quality, health impact, and climate models. © 2022 The Authors",yes,No,No,Yes
Airborne Emission Rate Measurements Validate Remote Sensing Observations and Emission Inventories of Western U.S. Wildfires,"Carbonaceous emissions from wildfires are a dynamic mixture of gases and particles that have important impacts on air quality and climate. Emissions that feed atmospheric models are estimated using burned area and fire radiative power (FRP) methods that rely on satellite products. These approaches show wide variability and have large uncertainties, and their accuracy is challenging to evaluate due to limited aircraft and ground measurements. Here, we present a novel method to estimate fire plume-integrated total carbon and speciated emission rates using a unique combination of lidar remote sensing aerosol extinction profiles and in situ measured carbon constituents. We show strong agreement between these aircraft-derived emission rates of total carbon and a detailed burned area-based inventory that distributes carbon emissions in time using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite FRP observations (Fuel2Fire inventory, slope = 1.33 ± 0.04, r2= 0.93, and RMSE = 0.27). Other more commonly used inventories strongly correlate with aircraft-derived emissions but have wide-ranging over- and under-predictions. A strong correlation is found between carbon monoxide emissions estimated in situ with those derived from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) for five wildfires with coincident sampling windows (slope = 0.99 ± 0.18; bias = 28.5%). Smoke emission coefficients (g MJ-1) enable direct estimations of primary gas and aerosol emissions from satellite FRP observations, and we derive these values for many compounds emitted by temperate forest fuels, including several previously unreported species. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Light Absorption by Cinnamaldehyde Constituents of Biomass Burning Organic Aerosol Modeled Using Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory,"Organic aerosol emitted from biomass burning absorbs visible radiation. However, the impact of this light absorption on the overall climate effects of atmospheric aerosol is not well known, partly due to variability in particle composition and absorptivity. Cinnamaldehydes, which consist of an aromatic ring with an unsaturated aldehyde substituent, are an important class of chromophores in light-absorbing organic aerosol, or brown carbon. Here, light absorption by a homologous series of three cinnamaldehydes─coumaraldehyde, coniferaldehyde, and sinapaldehyde─is modeled with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations, in the gas and aqueous phases. Based on a survey of hydration and acid dissociation equilibria, the neutral aldehyde is expected to be the predominant form of each species in the atmospheric aqueous phase. These species have complicated conformational landscapes compared to many other brown carbon constituents, like rigid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For coumaraldehyde, coniferaldehyde, and sinapaldehyde, a total of 8, 26, and 18 conformers were located, respectively. For each species, most of the total population is accounted for by the four most-populated conformers. The relative contributions of the conformers to the total light absorption of the respective species are dictated more by differences in the relative free energies than by differences in the molar absorption coefficients. As the functionalization increases, the absorption is red-shifted. The peaks predicted in water agree well with experimental spectra of coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde. No conformers have vertical transitions in the visible spectral range, so absorption above 380 nm is due to the shoulders of transitions of major conformers at ultraviolet wavelengths. These results demonstrate the importance of exploring potential energy landscapes, determining conformer stability and absorptivity, to predict the light absorption of chromophores in brown carbon. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",no,No,No,No
"Influence of biomass on coal slime combustion characteristics based on TG-FTIR, principal component analysis, and artificial neural network","The development and utilization of solid waste is an effective way to solve the severe environmental and energy crisis. In this study, Thermogravimetry - Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR) was used to carry out the co-combustion experiment of coal slime and rice husk under different mixing ratios. With the increase of the mass percentage of rice husk in the sample, the initial ignition temperature and burnout of the sample decreased, and the comprehensive combustion performance improved gradually. The dominant reaction in the co-combustion of coal slime and rice husk was determined by statistical method. When the mass percentage of rice husk in the mixture is between 30 and 90 %, it can inhibit the release of NOx and SO2. Taking Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose method as an example, the calculated average activation energies of coal slime and rice husk combustion are 105.66 and 148.93 kJ/mol respectively. With the increase of the mixing ratio of rice husk in the blend, the combustion mechanism of the sample changed. Finally, the mean absolute error, root mean square error and determination coefficient of the artificial neural network model are 0.52697, 0.67866 and 0.99941 respectively. © 2022",no,No,No,No
High-Altitude Air Pollutants Monitored from Rainwater Chemistry in the Central Himalaya,"Based on the ion chromatography method, the chemical characterization of rainwater (RW) samples collected over Srinagar (a location in central Himalaya) has been done during monsoon 2016 (MON-2016). The rainwater shows near acidic pH values ranging from 5.1 to 6.2 (average, 5.7 ± 0.6) during the study. The average ionic concentrations of 97 ± 10 μeq/1 were reported during MON-2016. Ca2+ has significantly high contribution of 24% as compared to NH4+ (18%), Na+ (9%), K+ (4%), and Mg2+ (3%) among cations, whereas Cl−, SO42−, and NO3− have contribution of ~ 15, 11, and 7%, respectively, among anions during chemical analysis. We have reported SO42−/NO3− ratio as 1.49, which shows contribution of 60 and 40% from SO42− and NO3− ions within the predicted limit of RW (H2SO4, 60–70%, and HNO3, 30–40%). Ca2+, Mg2+, and NH4+ have neutralization factors as 2.51, 0.37, and 2.01, respectively, due to the neutralization of acidic species in RW. The non-sea salt (NSS) contribution to total Ca2+, K+, and Mg2+ indicates the major contribution from crustal origin, whereas the NSS contribution to the total Cl− and SO42− was from the anthropogenic source. The principle component analysis (PCA) indicates that the first factor (i.e., natural sources, mainly dust and sea salts) has only ~ 9% variance. In contrast, the second factor (i.e., fossil fuel and biomass burning) has ~ 17% variance, and the third factor has 27% variance may be due to soil, agricultural, and biomass burning origin. The rest of the contributions are from mixed emission sources as well as by the transport of polluted air mass from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and Punjab Rajasthan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. This manuscript helps to understand the impact of crustal and anthropogenic sources in rainwater over the central Himalaya region of Uttarakhand. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",yes,No,No,Yes
Isotopic constraints confirm the significant role of microbial nitrogen oxides emissions from the land and ocean environment,"Nitrogen oxides (NOx, the sum of nitric oxide (NO) and N dioxide (NO2)) emissions and deposition have increased markedly over the past several decades, resulting in many adverse outcomes in both terrestrial and oceanic environments. However, because the microbial NOx emissions have been substantially underestimated on the land and unconstrained in the ocean, the global microbial NOx emissions and their importance relative to the known fossil-fuel NOx emissions remain unclear. Here we complied data on stable N isotopes of nitrate in atmospheric particulates over the land and ocean to ground-truth estimates of NOx emissions worldwide. By considering the N isotope effect of NOx transformations to particulate nitrate combined with dominant NOx emissions in the land (coal combustion, oil combustion, biomass burning and microbial N cycle) and ocean (oil combustion, microbial N cycle), we demonstrated that microbial NOx emissions account for 24 ± 4%, 58 ± 3% and 31 ± 12% in the land, ocean and global environment, respectively. Corresponding amounts of microbial NOx emissions in the land (13.6 ± 4.7 Tg N yr-1), ocean (8.8 ± 1.5 Tg N yr-1) and globe (22.5 ± 4.7 Tg N yr-1) are about 0.5, 1.4 and 0.6 times on average those of fossil-fuel NOx emissions in these sectors. Our findings provide empirical constraints on model predictions, revealing significant contributions of the microbial N cycle to regional NOx emissions into the atmospheric system, which is critical information for mitigating strategies, budgeting N deposition and evaluating the effects of atmospheric NOx loading on the world.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Iron from coal combustion particles dissolves much faster than mineral dust under simulated atmospheric acidic conditions,"Mineral dust is the largest source of aerosol iron (Fe) to the offshore global ocean, but acidic processing of coal fly ash (CFA) in the atmosphere could be an important source of soluble aerosol Fe. Here, we determined the Fe speciation and dissolution kinetics of CFA from Aberthaw (United Kingdom), Krakow (Poland), and Shandong (China) in solutions which simulate atmospheric acidic processing. In CFA PM10 fractions, 8%-21.5% of the total Fe was found to be hematite and goethite (dithionite-extracted Fe), and 2%-6.5% was found to be amorphous Fe (ascorbate-extracted Fe), while magnetite (oxalate-extracted Fe) varied from 3%-22%. The remaining 50%-87% of Fe was associated with other Fe-bearing phases, possibly aluminosilicates. High concentrations of ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4), often found in wet aerosols, increased Fe solubility of CFA up to 7 times at low pH (2-3). The oxalate effect on the Fe dissolution rates at pH 2 varied considerably, depending on the samples, from no impact for Shandong ash to doubled dissolution for Krakow ash. However, this enhancement was suppressed in the presence of high concentrations of (NH4)2SO4. Dissolution of highly reactive (amorphous) Fe was insufficient to explain the high Fe solubility at low pH in CFA, and the modelled dissolution kinetics suggest that other Fe-bearing phases such as magnetite may also dissolve relatively rapidly under acidic conditions. Overall, Fe in CFA dissolved up to 7 times faster than in a Saharan dust precursor sample at pH 2. Based on these laboratory data, we developed a new scheme for the proton-and oxalate-promoted Fe dissolution of CFA, which was implemented into the global atmospheric chemical transport model IMPACT (Integrated Massively Parallel Atmospheric Chemical Transport). The revised model showed a better agreement with observations of Fe solubility in aerosol particles over the Bay of Bengal, due to the initial rapid release of Fe and the suppression of the oxalate-promoted dissolution at low pH. The improved model enabled us to predict sensitivity to a more dynamic range of pH changes, particularly between anthropogenic combustion and biomass burning aerosols. © 2022 Clarissa Baldo et al.",no,No,No,No
Modeling Historical and Future Forest Fires in South Korea: The FLAM Optimization Approach,"Climate change-induced heat waves increase the global risk of forest fires, intensifying biomass burning and accelerating climate change in a vicious cycle. This presents a challenge to the response system in heavily forested South Korea, increasing the risk of more frequent and large-scale fire outbreaks. This study aims to optimize IIASA’s wildFire cLimate impacts and Adaptation Model (FLAM)—a processed-based model integrating biophysical and human impacts—to South Korea for projecting the pattern and scale of future forest fires. The developments performed in this study include: (1) the optimization of probability algorithms in FLAM based on the national GIS data downscaled to 1 km2 with additional factors introduced for national specific modeling; (2) the improvement of soil moisture computation by adjusting the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) to represent vegetation feedbacks by fitting soil moisture to daily remote sensing data; and (3) projection of future forest fire frequency and burned area. Our results show that optimization has considerably improved the modeling of seasonal patterns of forest fire frequency. Pearson’s correlation coefficient between monthly predictions and observations from national statistics over 2016–2022 was improved from 0.171 in the non-optimized to 0.893 in the optimized FLAM. These findings imply that FLAM’s main algorithms for interpreting biophysical and human impacts on forest fire at a global scale are only applicable to South Korea after the optimization of all modules, and climate change is the main driver of the recent increases in forest fires. Projections for forest fire were produced for four periods until 2100 based on the forest management plan, which included three management scenarios (current, ideal, and overprotection). Ideal management led to a reduction of 60–70% of both fire frequency and burned area compared to the overprotection scenario. This study should be followed by research for developing adaptation strategies corresponding to the projected risks of future forest fires. © 2023 by the authors.",yes,No,Yes,Yes
Advances in the characterization of aerosol optical properties using long-term data from AERONET in Buenos Aires,"We present a complete characterization of aerosols in Buenos Aires based on their optical and microphysical properties from a long-term record (19-years) of AERONET V3 observations at the CEILAP-BA site. The baseline climatology indicates that the city has low mean aerosol load (0.11 ± 0.1) and mean Ångström exponent (α) of 1.11 (±0.4). The long-term trend of the monthly median aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is not significant whereas monthly α medians show a significant negative trend. Atmospheric turbidity increases in August and September (40%). Annual and monthly particle size distributions show predominance of the coarse mode. This apportionment can change under particular conditions, e.g., showing increased fine mode load in August and September. The thresholds of α and AOT proposed for four aerosol types allowed a satisfactory classification of aerosols. The relationship between AOT and α clearly illustrated the major contribution to extinction of finer particles under more turbid conditions. This feature—not evident in the baseline climatology— is consistent with the presence of smoke from regional biomass burning. Sporadic intrusions of coarse particles (dust/ash) from remote sources also enhance extinction. The analysis of the interrelations among aerosol properties (fine mode fraction of AOT, volume concentration, spectral curvature, and size distribution) supports these findings. The aerosols seem to undergo aging and/or hydration processes as shown by the relationships among AOT, extinction due to the fine mode, spectral curvature, and aerosol fine mode radius. This comprehensive analysis revealed details associated with the contributions from local and remote anthropogenic and/or natural sources. © 2022 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",no,No,No,No
Evaluation of MODIS Dark Target AOD Product with 3 and 10 km Resolution in Amazonia,"The techniques and analyses employed by remote sensing provide key information about atmospheric particle properties at regional and global scales. However, limitations in optical spectral models used to represent the different types of aerosols in the atmosphere and their effects (direct and indirect) are still one of the major causes of sources of uncertainties and substantial impacts in climate prediction. There are no studies yet in South America, especially in the Amazon Basin, that have evaluated the advantages, disadvantages, inconsistencies, applicability, and suitability of the MODIS sensor (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) destined for monitoring the ambient aerosol optical thickness over rivers and continents. In this study, the results of the DT (Dark Target) algorithm for products with 3 km and 10 km resolutions were systematically evaluated for six sites in the Amazon rainforest. The comparisons between the products were carried out with the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) measurements, which were used as reference. Statistical parameters between AERONET vs. MODIS were also evaluated based on biomass burning records in the site regions. Here, the DT 10 km product showed satisfactory performance for the Amazon region, with observations between the expected error (EE) limits above 66%, in addition to R > 0.8 and RMSE < 0.3. However, the regional analysis for the two sites in the central and southern regions of the Amazon basin did not have the same performance, where the results showed an EE of 24 and 47%, respectively. The DT 3 km product did not perform well in any site, with an EE below 50%. Both products overestimated the AOD, but the 3 km product overestimated it approximately four times more due to its algorithm setup. Thus, we recommend the 10 km product for general analysis in Amazonia. Regional biomass burning records showed a direct relationship with the AERONET vs. MODIS DT with overestimation of both products. All variations between products and sites were justified based on the difficulty of retrieving surface reflectance and the model selected for local aerosols. Improvements in the optical spectral model currently implemented in the algorithms, with more realistic representations of the main types of the aerosol present in the Amazon Basin, may contribute to better performance among the evaluated products. © 2022 by the authors.",yes,No,Yes,Yes
Chemical Signatures of Seasonally Unique Anthropogenic Influences on Organic Aerosol Composition in the Central Amazon,"Urbanization and fires perturb the quantities and composition of fine organic aerosol in the central Amazon, with ramifications for radiative forcing and public health. These disturbances include not only direct emissions of particulates and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors but also changes in the pathways through which biogenic precursors form SOA. The composition of ambient organic aerosol is complex and incompletely characterized, encompassing millions of potential structures relatively few of which have been synthesized and characterized. Through analysis of submicron aerosol samples from the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon2014/5) field campaign by two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with machine learning, ∼1300 unique compounds were traced and characterized over two seasons. Fires and urban emissions produced chemically and interseasonally distinct impacts on product signatures, with only ∼50% of compounds observed in both seasons. Seasonally unique populations point to the importance of aqueous processing in Amazonian aerosol aging, but further mechanistic insights are impeded by limited product identity knowledge. Less than 10% of compounds were identifiable at an isomer-specific level. Overall, the findings (i) provide compositional characterization of anthropogenic influence on submicron organic aerosol in the Amazon, (ii) identify key season-to-season differences in chemical signatures, and (iii) highlight high-priority knowledge gaps in current speciated knowledge. © 2023 American Chemical Society",no,No,No,No
A Study of Urban Haze and Its Association with Cold Surge and Sea Breeze for Greater Bangkok,"This study deals with haze characteristics under the influence of the cold surge and sea breeze for Greater Bangkok (GBK) in 2017–2022, including haze intensity and duration, meteorological classification for haze, and the potential effects of secondary aerosols and biomass burning. A total of 38 haze episodes and 159 haze days were identified. The episode duration varies from a single day to up to 14 days, suggesting different pathways of its formation and evolution. Short-duration episodes of 1–2 days are the most frequent with 18 episodes, and the frequency of haze episodes decreases as the haze duration increases. The increase in complexity in the formation of relatively longer episodes is suggested by a relatively higher coefficient of variation for PM2.5. Four meteorology-based types of haze episodes were classified. Type I is caused by the arrival of the cold surge in GBK, which leads to the development of stagnant conditions favorable for haze formation. Type II is induced by sea breeze, which leads to the accumulation of air pollutants due to its local recirculation and development of the thermal internal boundary layer. Type III consists of the haze episodes caused by the synergetic effect of the cold surge and sea breeze while Type IV consists of short haze episodes that are not affected by either the cold surge or sea breeze. Type II is the most frequent (15 episodes), while Type III is the most persistent and most polluted haze type. The spread of haze or region of relatively higher aerosol optical depth outside GBK in Type III is potentially due to advection and dispersion, while that in Type IV is due to short 1-day episodes potentially affected by biomass burning. Due to cold surge, the coolest and driest weather condition is found under Type I, while Type II has the most humid condition and highest recirculation factor due to the highest average sea breeze duration and penetration. The precursor ratio method suggests the potential effect of secondary aerosols on 34% of the total haze episodes. Additionally, biomass burning is found to potentially affect half of the total episodes as suggested by the examination of back trajectories and fire hotspots. Based on these results, some policy implications and future work are also suggested. © 2023 by the authors.",no,No,No,No
Mapping the Contribution of Biomass Burning to Persistent Organic Pollutants in the Air of the Indo-China Peninsula Based on a Passive Air Monitoring Network,"Biomass burning (BB) is an important source of atmospheric persistent organic pollutants (POPs) across the world. However, there are few field-based regional studies regarding the POPs released from BB. Due to the current limitations of emission factors and satellites, the contribution of BB to airborne POPs is still not well understood. In this study, with the simultaneous monitoring of BB biomarkers and POPs based on polyurethane foam-based passive air sampling technique, we mapped the contribution of BB to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the Indo-China Peninsula. Spearman correlations between levoglucosan and 16 PCBs (rs= 0.264-0.767, p < 0.05) and 2 OCPs (rs= 0.250-0.328, p < 0.05) confirmed that BB may facilitate POP emissions. Source apportionment indicated that BB contributed 9.3% to the total PCB and OCP mass. The high contribution of positive matrix factorization-resolved BB to PCBs and OCPs was almost consistent with their concentration distributions in the open BB season but not completely consistent with those in the pre-monsoon and/or monsoon seasons. Their contribution distributions may reflect the use history and geographic distribution in secondary sources of POPs. The field-based contribution dataset of BB to POPs is significant in improving regional BB emission inventories and model prediction. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

Spatio-Temporal Monitoring of Atmospheric Pollutants Using Earth Observation Sentinel 5P TROPOMI Data: Impact of Stubble Burning a Case Study,"The problems of atmospheric pollutants are causing significant concern across the globe and in India. The aggravated level of atmospheric pollutants in the surrounding environment poses serious threats to normal living conditions by deteriorating air quality and causing adverse health impacts. Pollutant concentration increases during harvesting seasons of Kharif/Rabi due to stubble burning and is aggravated by other points or mobile sources. The present study is intended to monitor the spatio-temporal variation of the major atmospheric pollutants using Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data through cloud computing. Land Use/Land Cover (LULC-categorization or classification of human activities and natural coverage on the landscape) was utilised to extract the agricultural area in the study site. It involves the cloud computing of MOD64A1 (MODIS Burned monthly gridded data) and Sentinel-5P TROPOMI (S5P Tropomi) data for major atmospheric pollutants, such as CH4, NO2, SOx, CO, aerosol, and HCHO. The burned area output provided information regarding the stubble burning period, which has seen post-harvesting agricultural residue burning after Kharif crop harvesting (i.e., rice from April to June) and Rabi crop harvesting (i.e., wheat from September to November). The long duration of stubble burning is due to variation in farmers' harvesting and burning stubble/biomass remains in the field for successive crops. This period was used as criteria for considering the cloud computing of the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data for atmospheric pollutants concentration in the study site. The results showed a significant increase in CH4, SO2, SOx, CO, and aerosol concentration during the AMJ months (stubble burning of Rabi crops) and OND months (stubble burning of Kharif crops) of each year. The results are validated with the ground control station data for PM2.5/PM10. and patterns of precipitation and temperature-gridded datasets. The trajectory frequency for air mass movement using the HYSPLIT model showed that the highest frequency and concentration were observed during OND months, followed by the AMJ months of each year (2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021). This study supports the role and robustness of Earth observation Sentinel-5P TROPOMI to monitor and evaluate air quality and pollutants distribution. © 2022 by the authors.",yes,No,Yes,Yes
"Measurement report: Distinct size dependence and diurnal variation in organic aerosol hygroscopicity, volatility, and cloud condensation nuclei activity at a rural site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China","Organic aerosol (OA) has a significant contribution to cloud formation and hence climate change. However, high uncertainties still exist in its impact on global climate, owing to the varying physical properties affected by the complex formation and aging processes. In this study, the hygroscopicity, volatility, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity, and chemical composition of particles were measured using a series of online instruments at a rural site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China in fall 2019. During the campaign, the average hygroscopicity of OA (κOA) increased from 0.058 at 30 nm to 0.09 at 200 nm, suggesting a higher oxidation state of OA at larger particle sizes, supported by a higher fraction of extremely low volatility OA (ELVOA) for larger size particles. Significantly different diurnal patterns of κOA were observed between Aitken mode particles and accumulation mode particles. For Aitken mode particles (30-100 nm), the κOA values showed daily minima (0.02-0.07) during daytime, while the accumulation mode exhibited a daytime peak (g 0.09). Coincidently, a daytime peak was observed for both aged biomass burning organic aerosol (aBBOA) and less oxygenated organic aerosol (LOOA) based on source apportionment, which was attributed to the aging processes and gas-particle partitioning through photochemical reactions. In addition, the fraction of semi-volatile OA (SVOA) was higher at all measured sizes during daytime than during nighttime. These results indicate that the formation of secondary OA (SOA) through gas-particle partitioning can generally occur at all diameters, while the aging processes of pre-existing particles are more dominated in the accumulation mode. Furthermore, we found that applying a fixed κOA value (0.1) could lead to an overestimation of the CCN number concentration (NCCN) up to 12 %-19 % at 0.1 %-0.7 % supersaturation (SS), which was more obvious at higher SS during daytime. Better prediction of NCCN could be achieved by using size-resolved diurnal κOA, which indicates that the size dependence and diurnal variations in κOA can strongly affect the NCCN at different SS values. Our results highlight the need for accurately evaluating the atmospheric evolution of OA at different size ranges and their impact on the physicochemical properties and hence climate effects. © 2022 Mingfu Cai et al.",no,No,No,No
Alkaline electro-hydrolysis pretreatment of rice straw for enhanced biogas production under ambient temperature,"Biogas production can supplement the renewable energy target of the world. For this abundantly available agricultural waste like wheat and rice straw can be used. Biogas generation using this waste will curb the stubble burning incidences, reduce greenhouse gases, enhance farmer's income, and strengthen the energy security of many countries. The recalcitrant nature of rice straw is a barrier to its hydrolysis, which is a prerequisite of the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. Alkaline, electro-hydrolysis, and a combination of both pretreatment (alkaline electrohydrolysis) methods are undertaken in the present study. Batch reactors at ambient temperature were used for AD of rice straw at different inoculums to substrate ratios (ISR) of 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 to observe the effect on biogas/methane yield. Among these, a higher amount of biogas was obtained for ISR of 0.5 in all sets of experiments. The combined pretreatment method yielded biogas of 315.9 mL/gVS (equivalent to methane of 167.4 mL/gVS). For pretreat-ed rice straw by electro-hydrolysis, alkaline, and combined (alkaline and electro-hydrolysis) respectively, the methane yields were 7.03, 18.13, and 49.82% higher than untreated rice straw. The biogas had approximately 53% of methane content. The use of rice straw for biogas production may prove a viable alternative for clean and sustainable energy. In the studies, a first-order kinetic model is found to fit better the experimental results.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",,No,No,No
"Fuel connectivity, burn severity, and seed bank survivorship drive ecosystem transformation in a semiarid shrubland","A key challenge in ecology is understanding how multiple drivers interact to precipitate persistent vegetation state changes. These state changes may be both precipitated and maintained by disturbances, but predicting whether the state change will be fleeting or persistent requires an understanding of the mechanisms by which disturbance affects the alternative communities. In the sagebrush shrublands of the western United States, widespread annual grass invasion has increased fuel connectivity, which increases the size and spatial contiguity of fires, leading to postfire monocultures of introduced annual grasses (IAG). The novel grassland state can be persistent and is more likely to promote large fires than the shrubland it replaced. But the mechanisms by which prefire invasion and fire occurrence are linked to higher postfire flammability are not fully understood. A natural experiment to explore these interactions presented itself when we arrived in northern Nevada immediately after a 50,000 ha wildfire was extinguished. We hypothesized that the novel grassland state is maintained via a reinforcing feedback where higher fuel connectivity increases burn severity, which subsequently increases postfire IAG dispersal, seed survivorship, and fuel connectivity. We used a Bayesian joint species distribution model and structural equation model framework to assess the strength of the support for each element in this feedback pathway. We found that prefire fuel connectivity increased burn severity and that higher burn severity had mostly positive effects on the occurrence of IAG and another nonnative species and mostly negative or neutral relationships with all other species. Finally, we found that the abundance of IAG seeds in the seed bank immediately after a fire had a positive effect on the fuel connectivity 3 years after the fire, completing a positive feedback promoting IAG. These results demonstrate that the strength of the positive feedback is controlled by measurable characteristics of ecosystem structure, composition, and disturbance. Further, each node in the loop is affected independently by multiple global change drivers. It is possible that these characteristics can be modeled to predict threshold behavior and inform management actions to mitigate or slow the establishment of the grass–fire cycle, perhaps via targeted restoration applications or prefire fuel treatments. © 2022 The Authors.

"Factors influencing ambient particulate matter in Delhi, India: Insights from machine learning","Concentrations of ambient particulate matter (PM) depend on various factors including emissions of primary pollutants, meteorology and chemical transformations. New Delhi, India is the most polluted megacity in the world and routinely experiences extreme pollution episodes. As part of the Delhi Aerosol Supersite study, we measured online continuous PM1 (particulate matter of size less than 1 μm) concentrations and composition for over five years starting January 2017, using an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM). Here, we describe the development and application of machine learning models using random forest regression to estimate the concentrations, composition, sources and dynamics of PM in Delhi. These models estimate PM1 species concentrations based on meteorological parameters including ambient temperature, relative humidity, planetary boundary layer height, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation, agricultural burning fire counts, solar radiation and cloud cover. We used hour of day, day of week and month of year as proxies for time-dependent emissions (e.g., emissions from traffic during rush hours). We demonstrate the applicability of these models to capture temporal variability of the PM1 species, to understand the influence of individual factors via sensitivity analyses, and to separate impacts of the COVID-19 lockdowns and associated activity restrictions from impacts of other factors. Our models provide new insights into the factors influencing ambient PM1 in New Delhi, India, demonstrating the power of machine learning models in atmospheric science applications.

Influence of longitudinal wind on mass burning rate of rectangular heptane pool fire with different aspect ratios,"Fire is one of the primary disasters that threaten the safe operation of tunnel and underground space. Mass burning rate is a significant parameter in characterizing the behavior of pool fire which is related to thermal feedback, pool shape and ambient wind. Five convection-controlled heptane pool fires are examined inside a longitudinal wind tunnel with aspect ratio of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. The variation of burning rate with longitudinal wind is divided into increasing regime at v < 0.96 m/s, decreasing regime at 0.96 ≤ v < 1.98 m/s, and slightly-fluctuating regime at 1.98 ≤ v < 2.49 m/s. The effect of longitudinal wind on burning rate is attributed to heat feedback, flow disturbance and oxidizer supply around the flame. The increment of burning rate with wind speed is proved by the liquid evaporation theory. The heat transfer analysis proves that the enlargement rate of burning rate is linearly proportional to a coupling factor of longitudinal air flow speed and aspect ratio in a unified mathematical correlation [Formula presented] which is fully consistent with measurements. The results provide guidance for tunnel fire protection design and prediction of fire development under the condition of vehicle tank leakage inside a tunnel. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
A parent-school initiative to assess and predict air quality around a heavily trafficked school,"Many primary schools in the UK are situated in close proximity to heavily-trafficked roads, yet long-term air pollution monitoring around such schools to establish factors affecting the variability of exposure is limited. We co-designed a study to monitor particulate matter in different size fractions (PM1, PM2.5, PM10), gaseous pollutants (NO2, O3 and CO) and meteorological parameters (ambient temperature, relative humidity) over a period of one year. The period included phases of national COVID-19 lockdown and its subsequent easing and removal. Statistical analysis was used to assess the diurnal patterns, pollution hotspots and underlying factors driving changes. A pollution episode was observed early in January 2021, owing to new year celebration fireworks, when the daily average PM2.5 was around three-times the World Health Organisation limit. PM2.5 and NO2 exceeded the threshold limits on 15 and 10 days, respectively, as the lockdown eased and the school reopened, despite the predominant wind direction often being away from the school towards the roads. The peak concentration levels for all pollutants occurred during morning drop-off hours; however, some weekends showed higher or comparable concentrations to those during weekdays. The strong disproportional Pearson correlation between CO and temperature demonstrated the possible contribution of local sources through biomass burning. The impact of lifting restrictions after removing the weather impact showed that the average pollution levels were low in the beginning and increased by up to 22.7 % and 4.2 % for PM2.5 and NO2, respectively, with complete easing of lockdown. The Prophet algorithm was implemented to develop a prediction model using an NO2 dataset that performed moderately (R2, 0.48) for a new monthly dataset. This study was able to build a local air pollution database at a school gate, which enabled an understanding of the air pollution variability across the year and allowed evidence-based mitigation strategies to be devised. © 2022 The Authors",,No,No,No
"Smoke in the river: an Aerosols, Radiation and Clouds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) case study","The formation of a river of smoke crossing southern Africa was investigated during the Aerosols, Radiation and Clouds in southern Africa (AEROCLO-sA) campaign in September 2017. A complementary set of global and mesoscale numerical simulations as well as ground-based, airborne and space-borne observations of the dynamics, thermodynamics and composition of the atmosphere are used to characterize the river of smoke in terms of timing and vertical extent of the biomass burning aerosol (BBA) layer. The study area was under the synoptic influence of a coastal low rooted in a tropical easterly wave and a high-pressure system over the continent and westerly waves at mid latitudes, one of which had an embedded cut-off low (CoL). The coastal low interacted with the second of two approaching westerly waves and ultimately formed a mid-level tropical temperate trough (TTT). The TTT created the fast-moving air mass transported to the southwestern Indian Ocean as a river of smoke. The CoL, which developed and intensified in the upper levels associated with the first (easternmost) westerly wave, remained stationary above northern Namibia prior to the formation of the TTT and was responsible for the thickening of the BBA layer. This shows that the evolution of the river of smoke is very much tied to the evolution of the TTT, while its vertical extent is related to the presence of the CoL. The mechanisms by which the CoL, observed over Namibia in the entrance region of the river of smoke, influences the vertical structure of the BBA layer is mainly associated with the ascending motion above the BBA layer. In the presence of the CoL, the top of the BBA layer over northern Namibia reaches altitudes above 8ĝ€¯km. This is much higher than the average height of the top of the BBA layer over the regions where the smoke comes from (Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique), which is 5 to 6ĝ€¯km. The results suggest that the interaction between the TTTs and the CoLs which form during the winter may have a role in promoting the transport of BBA from fire-prone regions in the tropical band to the temperate mid latitudes and the southwestern Indian Ocean.  © Copyright: ",,No,No,No
Classification of MODIS fire emission data based on aerosol absorption Angstrom exponent retrieved from AERONET data,"Biomass burning emits a large quantity of gaseous pollutants and aerosols into the atmosphere, which perturbs the regional and global climate and has significant impacts on air quality and human health. In order to understand the temporal and spatial distributions of biomass burning and its contribution to aerosol optical and radiative impacts, we examined fire emission data and its contribution to aerosol optical and radiative impacts over six major hot-spot continents/sub-continents across the globe, namely North-Central (NC) Africa, South America, US-Hawaii, South Asia, South East Asia, and Australia-New Zealand, using long-term satellites, ground-based and re-analysis data during 2000–2021. The selected six sites contributed ∼70% of total global fire data. The classification of biomass burning, such as pre, active, and post burning phases, was performed based on the Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE) estimated from 55 AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) stations. The study found the highest contribution of fire count (55 %) during the active burning phase followed by post (36 %) and pre (8 %) burning phases. Such high fire counts were associated with high absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) during the active fire event. Strong dominance of fine and coarse mode mixed aerosols were also observed during active and post fire regimes. High AAOD and low Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE) over NC Africa during the fire events suggested presence of mineral dust mixed with biomass burning aerosols. Brightness temperature, fire radiative power and fire count were also dominated by the active burning followed by post and pre burning phases. The maximum heating rate of 3.15 K day−1 was observed during the active fire events. The heating rate profile shows clear variations for three different fire regimes with the highest value of 1.80 K day−1 at ∼750 hPa altitude during the active fire event. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,No,No,No
Improving the Combustion Factor to Estimate GHG Emissions Associated with Fire in Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp. Plantations in Chile,"Forest plantations can substantially contribute to carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation at the country and global scales. Forest fires (especially when combined with droughts) may remarkably reduce such carbon sequestration capability. The IPCC has global-scale estimates for such losses, but they can vary widely depending on crops, climate, topography, and management, among other factors. The IPCC defines a factor for biomass loss as a consequence of forest fires, expressed as a fraction of total biomass. This methodology implies using aggregated data and the default emission factor, which are only recommended for countries where wildfires are not a key category. In Chile, over the last decade, there have been between 5000 and 8000 wildfires annually (an average of 6398 for the period 2011–2020), burning an average of 122,328 hectares each year. Countries may progress in the refinement of such factors depending on the availability and reliability of local values. This paper aims at estimating (Formula presented.) values for the main forest plantation species in Chile, Pinus radiata, Eucalyptus nitens, and Eucalyptus globulus, across different age-classes and forest fire severity. To achieve this aim, we assessed the biomass loss after forest fires for a stratified sample of forest plots for the season 2018–2019. We fitted a model to predict the amount of biomass loss during fires, and in this way, predict the emissions associated with wildfires. The model employs very simple predictive variables, age and species, because statistics for burnt areas in plantations are only provided by age-classes and species, without details about productivity or management. © 2023 by the authors.",,No,No,No
"Sources and processes of organic aerosol in non-refractory PM1 and PM2.5 during foggy and haze episodes in an urban environment of the Yangtze River Delta, China","Organic aerosol (OA) generally accounts for a large fraction of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the urban atmosphere. Despite significant advances in the understanding their emission sources, transformation processes and optical properties in the submicron aerosol fraction (PM1), larger size fractions - e.g., PM2.5 - still deserve complementary investigations. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis on sources, formation process and optical properties of OA in PM1 and PM2.5 under haze and foggy environments in the Yangtze River Delta (eastern China), using two aerosol chemical speciation monitors, as well as a photoacoustic extinctiometer at 870 nm. Positive matrix factorization analysis - using multilinear engine (ME2) algorithm - was conducted on PM1 and PM2.5 organic mass spectra. Four OA factors were identified, including three primary OA (POA) factors, i.e., hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), cooking OA (COA), and biomass burning OA (BBOA), and a secondary OA (SOA) factor, i.e., oxidized oxygenated OA (OOA). An enhanced PM1-2.5 COA concentration was clearly observed during cooking peak hours, suggesting important contribution of fresh cooking emissions on large-sized particles (i.e., PM1-2.5). The oxidation state and concentration of PM2.5 HOA were higher than that in PM1, suggesting that large-sized HOA particles might be linked to oxidized POA. High contribution (44%) of large-sized OOA to non-refractory PM2.5 mass was observed during haze episodes. During foggy episodes, PM1 and PM2.5 OOA concentrations increased as a positive relationship over time, along with an exponential increase in the PM2.5-OOA to PM1-OOA ratio. Meanwhile, OOA loadings increased with the aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) during foggy episodes. Random forest cross-validation analysis also supported the important influence of ALWC on OOA variations, supporting substantial impact of aqueous process on SOA formation during haze and/or foggy episodes. Obtained results also indicated high OOA contributions (21%–36%) and low POA contributions (6%–14%) to the PM2.5 scattering coefficient during haze and foggy episodes, respectively. Finally, we could illustrate that atmospheric vertical diffusion and horizontal transport have important but different effects on the concentrations of different primary and secondary OA factors in different particle size fractions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",,No,No,No
AEROsol generic classification using a novel Satellite remote sensing Approach (AEROSA),"Numerous studies (hereafter GA: general approach studies) have been made to classify aerosols into desert dust (DD), biomass-burning (BB), clean continental (CC), and clean maritime (CM) types using only aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångström exponent (AE). However, AOD represents the amount of aerosol suspended in the atmospheric column while the AE is a qualitative indicator of the size distribution of the aerosol estimated using AOD measurements at different wavelengths. Therefore, these two parameters do not provide sufficient information to unambiguously classify aerosols into these four types. Evaluation of the performance of GA classification applied to AErosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) data, at sites for situations with known aerosol types, provides many examples where the GA method does not provide correct results. For example, a thin layer of haze was classified as BB and DD outside the crop burning and dusty seasons respectively, a thick layer of haze was classified as BB, and aerosols from known crop residue burning events were classified as DD, CC, and CM by the GA method. The results also show that the classification varies with the season, for example, the same range of AOD and AE were observed during a dust event in the spring (20th March 2012) and a smog event in the autumn (2nd November 2017). The results suggest that only AOD and AE cannot precisely classify the exact nature (i.e., DD, BB, CC, and CM) of aerosol types without incorporating more optical and physical properties. An alternative approach, AEROsol generic classification using a novel Satellite remote sensing Approach (AEROSA), is proposed to provide aerosol amount and size information using AOD and AE, respectively, from the Terra-MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Collection 6.1 Level 2 combined Dark Target and Deep Blue (DTB) product and AERONET Version 3 Level 2.0 data. Although AEROSA is also based on AOD and AE, it does not claim the nature of aerosol types, instead providing information on aerosol amount and size. The purpose is to introduce AEROSA for those researchers who are interested in the generic classification of aerosols based on AOD and AE, without claiming the exact aerosol types such as DD, BB, CC, and CM. AEROSA not only provides 9 generic aerosol classes for all observations but can also accommodate variations in location and season, which GA aerosol types do not.

"Assessing over decadal biomass burning influence on particulate matter composition in subequatorial Amazon: literature review, remote sensing, chemical speciation and machine learning application","A study on aerosols in the Brazilian subequatorial Amazon region, Tangará da Serra (TS) and Alta Floresta (AF) was conducted and compared to findings in an additional site with background characteristics (Manaus, AM). TS and AF counties suffer from intense biomass burning periods in the dry season, and it accounts for high levels of particles in the atmosphere. Chemical characterization of fine and coarse particulate matter (PM) was performed to quantify water-soluble ions (WSI) and black carbon (BC). The importance of explanatory variables was assessed using three machine learning techniques. Average concentrations of PM in AF and TS were similar (PM2.0, 17±10 µg m-3 (AF) and 16±11 µg m-3 (TS) and PM10-2.0, 13±5 µg m-3 (AF) and 11±7 µg m-3 (TS)), but higher than the background site. BC and SO2-4 were the prevalent components as they represented 27%– 68% of particulates chemical composition. The combination of the machine learning techniques provided a further understanding of the pathways for PM concentration variability, and the results highlighted the influence of biomass burning for key sample groups and periods. PM2.0, BC, and most WSI presented higher concentrations in the dry season, providing further support for the influence of biomass burning. © 2023, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

Projection of the Near-Future PM2.5 in Northern Peninsular Southeast Asia under RCP8.5,"Throughout the year, particularly during the dry season, the northern peninsula of Southeast Asia struggles with air pollution from PM2.5. In this study, we used the Nested Regional Climate and Chemistry Model (NRCM-Chem) to predict the PM2.5 concentrations over Southeast Asia’s northern peninsula during the years 2020-2029 under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5. In general, the model reasonably shows a good result, including temperature, precipitation, and PM2.5 concentration, compared to the observation with an Index of Agreement (IOA) in the range of 0.63 to 0.80. However, there were some underestimations for modeled precipitation and temperature and an overestimation for modeled PM2.5 concentration. As a response to changes in climatic parameters and the emission of PM2.5’s precursors, PM2.5 concentrations tend to increase across the region in the range of (+1) to (+35) µg/m3 during the dry season (November to April) and decline in the range of (−3) to (−30) µg/m3 during the wet season (May to October). The maximum increase in PM2.5 concentrations were found in March by >40 µg/m3. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,No,No,No
Conventional and Zero Tillage with Residue Management in Rice–Wheat System in the Indo-Gangetic Plains: Impact on Thermal Sensitivity of Soil Organic Carbon Respiration and Enzyme Activity,"The impact of global warming on soil carbon (C) mineralization from bulk and aggregated soil in conservation agriculture (CA) is noteworthy to predict the future of C cycle. Therefore, sensitivity of soil C mineralization to temperature was studied from 18 years of a CA experiment under rice–wheat cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). The experiment comprised of three tillage systems: zero tillage (ZT), conventional tillage (CT), and strip tillage (ST), each with three levels of residue management: residue removal (NR), residue burning (RB), and residue retention (R). Cumulative carbon mineralization (Ct) in the 0–5 cm soil depth was significantly higher in CT with added residues (CT-R) and ZT with added residues (ZT-R) compared with the CT without residues (CT-NR). It resulted in higher CO2 evolution in CT-R and ZT-R. The plots, having crop residue in both CT and ZT system, had higher (p < 0.05) Van’t-Hoff factor (Q10) and activation energy (Ea) than the residue burning. Notably, micro-aggregates had significantly higher Ea than bulk soil (~14%) and macro-aggregates (~40%). Aggregate-associated C content was higher in ZT compared with CT (p < 0.05). Conventional tillage with residue burning had a reduced glomalin content and β-D-glucosidase activity than that of ZT-R. The ZT-R improved the aggregate-associated C that could sustain the soil biological diversity in the long-run possibly due to higher physical, chemical, and matrix-mediated protection of SOC. Thus, it is advisable to maintain the crop residues on the soil surface in ZT condition (~CA) to cut back on valuable C from soils under IGP and similar agro-ecologies. © 2023 by the authors.",,No,No,No
Burnt-Area Quick Mapping Method with Synthetic Aperture Radar Data,"Forest and field fires have become a frequent phenomenon in recent years caused by human activities in Indonesia, affecting all forms of forest and field cover. Forest fire-degraded land is more prone to burn again, due to the nature of peatland in Kalimantan. Rapid mapping technology for burnt areas affected by forest fires is needed to obtain this information. The use of remote sensing technology, in the form of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, combined with cloud computing processing speeds up data processing and is not affected by the existing cloud cover. The Quick-Mapping employed in this research provides faster mapping time, compared to the currently employed method, based on field report data, to enable a better and more efficient firefighting effort. The data processing is carried out using cloud computing, enabling the processing of large amounts of data. The processing is carried out starting with importing the data, preprocessing to classification running, simultaneously, using the JavaScript programming language. The research classifies the burnt area from backscatter patterns before and after the event in two measurements, namely the radar burn ratio (RBR) and the radar burn difference (RBD). The RBR is defined as the average backscatter ratio at a certain polarization, while RBD is the difference between the average scattering conditions. The composite image for the classification utilizes images from the RBR and RBD with co-polarized (VV) and cross-polarized (VH) backscatter. The burnt area difference is −1.9 for VH and −1.7 for VV, which indicates a lower backscatter, due to forest fire. The classification of the burnt area yields the best overall accuracy of 88.26% with a support vector machine and processing time of 1 h, compared to the currently 12 h needed to provide burnt area maps from field observation data. © 2022 by the authors.",,No,No,No
Learnings from COVID-19 Forced Lockdown on Regional Air Quality and Mitigation Potential for South Asia,"South Asia is a hotspot of air pollution with limited resilience and hence, understanding the mitigation potential of different sources is critically important. In this context the country lockdown initiated to combat the COVID-19 pandemic (during March and April 2020 that is the pre-monsoon season) provides an unique opportunity for studying the relative impacts of different emission sources in the region. Here, we analyze changes in levels of air quality species across the region during selected lockdown periods using satellite and in-situ datasets. This analysis compares air quality levels during the lockdown against pre-lockdown conditions as well as against regional long-term mean. Satellite derived AOD, NO2, and CO data indicates an increase of 9.5%, 2%, and 2.6%, respectively, during the 2020 lockdown period compared to pre-lockdown over the South Asia domain. However, individual country statistics, urban site data, and industrial grid analysis within the region indicate a more varied picture. Cities with high traffic loads reported a reduction of 12–39% in columnar NO2 during lockdown, in-situ PM2.5 measurements indicate a 23–56% percent reduction over the country capitals and columnar SO2 has an approximate reduction of 50% over industrial areas. In contrast, pollutant emissions from natural sources e.g., from biomass burning were observed to be adversely affecting the air quality in this period potentially masking expected lockdown related air quality improvements. This study demonstrates the need for a more nuanced and situation specific understanding of sources of air pollutants (anthropogenic and natural) and for these sources to be better understood from the local to the regional scale. Without this deeper understanding, mitigation strategies cannot be effectively targeted, wasting limited resources as well as risking unintended consequences both for the atmosphere and how mitigation action is perceived by the wider public. © The Author(s).

Sentinel-5P Based Estimation of PM2.5Concentrations Across Thailand Using Tabnet,"The Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), concentration is a widely used indicator of air quality. The estimation of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations has been approximated by numerous models and machine learning (ML) approaches, utilizing satellite-derived datasets in their most recent advancements. However, past ML applications have used primarily tree-based algorithms, while neural network based methods are under-explored. In the current study we present a model via the Attentive Interpretable Learning neural network (TabNet), incorporating Sentinel-5P datasets and meteorological observations to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations across Thailand. The proposed model achieves statistically reliable performances surpassing other tree-based leading ML models. Carbon Monoxide exhibits the highest significance on the model indicating agricultural burnings as the main emission source in Thailand. The proposed approach demonstrates the capacity of deep learning for PM2.5 estimations and expands its potential to improve the accuracy in air quality quantification. © 2022 IEEE.",,No,No,No
A review of particulate pollution over Himalaya region: Characteristics and salient factors contributing ambient PM pollution,"The Himalayas, which include delicate and unspoiled ecosystems, have the third-largest glacier ice store in the world. Recent research reveals that anthropogenic and natural factors contribute to the deteriorating air quality in the region. Rising particulate matter (PM) levels might have devastating effects on the regional climate, hydrologic cycles, and ecology. Given the scarcity of studies (the majority of which are of short duration and focus on a single pollutant and satellite-based observation), unique topography, meteorological characteristics, monsoon dynamics, temperature inversion, and mixing of pollution emission from local and distant sources, it is difficult to understand the general pollution trend in the Himalaya. Nonetheless, past studies indicate that local biomass burning, long-distance transport, especially from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGPs), dust storms, and tourist activities are the primary drivers to rising PM pollution in the Himalayas region. Emissions from these sources develop exponentially and encompass severe pollution episodes because of the IGP's complicated hilly terrain, cloud condensation nucleation process, atmospheric brown clouds (haze), dust storm, and transport of PM from crop residue burning (especially during the post-monsoon season). In light of this, the current work outlines the sources, factors, and variables that contribute to the Himalayan region's rising pollution levels and sheds light on significant areas of recent research. The present study examines in depth the consequences of the monsoon, the dynamics of pollution in IGP, and the movement of PM from IGP to the Himalayan region. This review aims to highlight research gaps and limitations in the existing literature for a better understanding of the current PM pollution in the Himalayas and surrounding sites, which is essential for understanding climate change and health consequences in this region, and to provide significant theoretical and practical implications for assessing particulate pollution in the Himalayas region. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Compilation of a city-scale black carbon emission inventory: Challenges in developing countries based on a case study in Brazil,"Black carbon (BC) inventories for cities are scarce, especially in developing countries, despite their importance to tackle climate change and local air pollution. Here, we draw on results from a case study in a Brazilian city to discuss the challenges of compiling a BC inventory for different activity sectors. We included traditionally inventoried sectors, such as industries and on-road transportation, other less reported sectors (food establishments and aviation), and open burning of household solid waste (HSW), typically found in developing countries. We present a machine-learning technique (Random Forest) as a novel approach to obtain HSW burning activity using a set of spatial predictors. The BC inventory was based on PM2.5 emissions weighted by the fraction of PM2.5 emitted as BC and developed for the year 2018. We also reported the disaggregated spatial PM2.5 emissions for the same combustion sources, and documented the databases used for activity data and emission factors (EF). The total estimated BC and PM2.5 emissions amounted to 57.88 and 234.75 tons, respectively, with on-road vehicle exhaust emissions and industrial combustion as the main BC sources (63 and 22%, respectively). For PM2.5 emissions, on-road transportation (exhaust and non-exhaust) contributed 48%, followed by industrial combustion (21%) and food establishments (20%). Population density, number of vacant lots, and property tax values were identified as the most important features to predict the HSW fire activity. A comparison with other inventories revealed that the BC emission profile of Londrina is similar to the profile reported for Greater Mexico City, another Latin American city. Thus, the methodology used in this study could be extended to other cities with similar local BC sources. Finally, we highlight that the lack of local activity data, representative EF, and even methodology may undermine the development of reliable BC inventories, and intensive research should be conducted to characterize the emission sources. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,No,No,No
Internal variability and forcing influence model–satellite differences in the rate of tropical tropospheric warming,"Climate-model simulations exhibit approximately two times more tropical tropospheric warming than satellite observations since 1979. The causes of this difference are not fully understood and are poorly quantified. Here, we apply machine learning to relate the patterns of surface-temperature change to the forced and unforced components of tropical tropospheric warming. This approach allows us to disentangle the forced and unforced change in the model-simulated temperature of the midtroposphere (TMT). In applying the climate-model-trained machine-learning framework to observations, we estimate that external forcing has produced a tropical TMT trend of 0.25 ± 0.08 K.decade21 between 1979 and 2014, but internal variability has offset this warming by 0.07 ± 0.07 K.decade21. Using the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) large ensemble, we also find that a discontinuity in the variability of prescribed biomass-burning aerosol emissions artificially enhances simulated tropical TMT change by 0.04 K.decade21. The magnitude of this aerosol-forcing bias will vary across climate models, but since the latest generation of climate models all use the same emissions dataset, the bias may systematically enhance climate-model trends over the satellite era. Our results indicate that internal variability and forcing uncertainties largely explain differences in satellite-versus-model warming and are important considerations when evaluating climate models.

Identifying chemical aerosol signatures using optical suborbital observations: How much can optical properties tell us about aerosol composition?,"Improvements in air quality and Earth's climate predictions require improvements of the aerosol speciation in chemical transport models, using observational constraints. Aerosol speciation (e.g., organic aerosols, black carbon, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, dust or sea salt) is typically determined using in situ instrumentation. Continuous, routine aerosol composition measurements from ground-based networks are not uniformly widespread over the globe. Satellites, on the other hand, can provide a maximum coverage of the horizontal and vertical atmosphere but observe aerosol optical properties (and not aerosol speciation) based on remote sensing instrumentation. Combinations of satellite-derived aerosol optical properties can inform on air mass aerosol types (AMTs). However, these AMTs are subjectively defined, might often be misclassified and are hard to relate to the critical parameters that need to be refined in models. In this paper, we derive AMTs that are more directly related to sources and hence to speciation. They are defined, characterized and derived using simultaneous in situ gas-phase, chemical and optical instruments on the same aircraft during the Study of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS, an airborne field campaign carried out over the US during the summer of 2013). We find distinct optical signatures for AMTs such as biomass burning (from agricultural or wildfires), biogenic and polluted dust. We find that all four AMTs, studied when prescribed using mostly airborne in situ gas measurements, can be successfully extracted from a few combinations of airborne in situ aerosol optical properties (e.g., extinction Ångström exponent, absorption Ångström exponent and real refractive index). However, we find that the optically based classifications for biomass burning from agricultural fires and polluted dust include a large percentage of misclassifications that limit the usefulness of results related to those classes. The technique and results presented in this study are suitable to develop a representative, robust and diverse source-based AMT database. This database could then be used for widespread retrievals of AMTs using existing and future remote sensing suborbital instruments/networks. Ultimately, it has the potential to provide a much broader observational aerosol dataset to evaluate chemical transport and air quality models than is currently available by direct in situ measurements. This study illustrates how essential it is to explore existing airborne datasets to bridge chemical and optical signatures of different AMTs, before the implementation of future spaceborne missions (e.g., the next generation of Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites addressing Aerosols, Cloud, Convection and Precipitation (ACCP) designated observables). © 2022 Copernicus GmbH.

An Analysis of the Aerosol Lifecycle Over India: COALESCE Intercomparison of Three General Circulation Models,"Atmospheric aerosols or atmospheric particulate matter affects climate variables like temperature and rainfall, agricultural productivity, soil, and human health. We evaluated aerosol lifecycle over India via simulations (2005–2014) from three general circulation models under the COALESCE project (carbonaceous aerosol emissions, source apportionment, and climate impacts; Venkataraman et al., 2020, 10.1175/bams-d-19-0030.1). The ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3, CAM5.3, and NICAM-SPRINTARS simulations use identical regional emissions (from the Speciated Multi-pollutant generator, SMoG-India-v1). Satisfactory model simulations of meteorological variable magnitudes and seasonal cycle have been achieved partly from the adoption of nudging. Estimations of anthropogenic aerosol, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and particulate matter surface concentrations are significantly improved from (a) dust tuning (b) use of satellite-derived organic aerosol to carbon ratio, and (c) nudged meteorology to capture variables influencing the production of secondary sulfate. Larger wintertime under prediction (−30% to −60%) results from over prediction of seasonal planetary boundary layer height and the absence of secondary ammonium nitrate and organic aerosols. Vertical dispersion to higher altitudes than in observations calls for improved modeling of vertical mass flux representation. Carbonaceous aerosol residence time and AOD fraction larger than global mean values in India, with a seasonal predominance in the autumn and winter seasons can be explained by enhanced regional emissions from residential biofuel cooking, agricultural stubble burning, and traditional informal industries like brick production. © 2022.

Identification of aerosol types over the central Indo-Gangetic Plain using multi-satellite observations,"Identification and quantification of aerosol types in the central Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) region is done using long-term (2005 - 2019) and simultaneous datasets, from satellite and reanalysis, of aerosol optical depth (AOD), absorbing aerosol index (AAI) and Ångström exponent (α). In order to identify aerosol types in the central IGP, we used two classification methods by assigning the predefined thresholds of (i) AOD and α and (ii) AOD, a and AAI. Results derived from Method 1 suggest anthropogenic aerosols (AA) are dominant during the study period followed by mixed type (MT) and biomass burning (BB) aerosols over Gorakhpur. From Method 2, it is apparent that absorbing aerosols dominate during pre-monsoon (PM), post-monsoon (PoM) and winter (W) seasons, and non-absorbing aerosols during monsoon (M). BB aerosols derived from method 1 and carbonaceous aerosols from method 2 showed the highest contribution during PoM and W season. This is due to increased burning of agricultural waste and forest fires in the IGP region during this period. Dust aerosols derived from both methods showed maximum contribution during PM season, with marginal contributions during M and W seasons, respectively, and negligible during PoM season. © 2022 International Radio Science Union (URSI).",,No,No,No
Evaluation of aerosol iron solubility over Australian coastal regions based on inverse modeling: implications of bushfires on bioaccessible iron concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere,"Mineral dust is the major source of external micro-nutrients such as iron (Fe) to the open ocean. However, large uncertainties in model estimates of Fe emissions and aerosol-bearing Fe solubility (i.e., the ratio of labile Fe (LFe) to total Fe (TFe)) in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) hampered accurate estimates of atmospheric delivery of bioavailable Fe to the Southern Ocean. This study applied an inverse modeling technique to a global aerosol chemistry transport model (IMPACT) in order to optimize predictions of mineral aerosol Fe concentrations based on recent observational data over Australian coastal regions (110°E–160°E and 10°S–41°S). The optimized (a posteriori) model did not only better capture aerosol TFe concentrations downwind from Australian dust outbreak but also successfully reproduced enhanced Fe solubility (7.8 ± 8.4%) and resulted in much better agreement of LFe concentrations with the field measurements (1.4 ± 1.5 vs. 1.4 ± 2.3 ng Fe m–3). The a posteriori model estimates suggested that bushfires contributed a large fraction of LFe concentrations in aerosols, although substantial contribution from missing sources (e.g., coal mining activities, volcanic eruption, and secondary formation) was still inferred. These findings may have important implications for the projection of future micro-nutrient supply to the oceans as increasing frequency and intensity of open biomass burning are projected in the SH.

Polar semivolatile organic compounds in biomass-burning emissions and their chemical transformations during aging in an oxidation flow reactor,"Semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) emitted from open biomass burning (BB) can contribute to chemical and physical properties of atmospheric aerosols and also may cause adverse health effects. The polar fraction of SVOCs is a prominent part of BB organic aerosols, and thus it is important to characterize the chemical composition and reactivity of this fraction. In this study, globally and regionally important representative fuels (Alaskan peat, Moscow peat, Pskov peat, eucalyptus, Malaysian peat, and Malaysian agricultural peat) were burned under controlled conditions using the combustion chamber facility at the Desert Research Institute (DRI). Gas- and particle-phase biomass-burning emissions were aged in an oxidation flow reactor (OFR) to mimic 5-7&thinsp;d of atmospheric aging. Fresh and OFR-aged biomass-burning aerosols were collected on Teflon-impregnated glass fiber filters (TIGF) in tandem with XAD resin media for organic carbon speciation. The polar fraction extracted with dichloromethane and acetone was analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for 84 polar organic compounds - including mono- and dicarboxylic acids, methoxylated phenols, aromatic acids, anhydrosugars, resin acids, and sterols. For all these compounds, fuel-based emission factors (EFs) were calculated for fresh and OFR-aged samples. The carbon mass of the quantified polar compounds was found to constitute 5&thinsp;% to 7&thinsp;% of the total organic compound mass. A high abundance of methoxyphenols (239&thinsp;mg&thinsp;kgspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""-1/span for Pskov peat; 22.6&thinsp;% of total GC-MS characterized mass) and resin acids (118&thinsp;mg&thinsp;kgspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""-1/span for Alaskan peat; 14.5&thinsp;% of total GC-MS characterized mass) was found in peat-burning emissions (smoldering combustion). The concentration of some organic compounds (e.g., tetracosanoic acid) with a molecular weight (MW) above 350&thinsp;g&thinsp;molspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""-1/span decreased after OFR aging, while abundances of low-MW compounds (e.g., hexanoic acid) increased. This indicated a significant extent of fragmentation reactions in the OFR. Methoxyphenols decreased after OFR aging, while a significant increase (3.7 to 8.6 times) in the abundance of dicarboxylic acids emission factors (EFs), especially maleic acid (10 to 60 times), was observed. EFs for fresh and ratios from fresh-to-aged BB samples reported in this study can be used to perform source apportionment and predict processes occurring during atmospheric transport.. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Impact of various air mass types on cloud condensation nuclei concentrations along coastal southeast Florida,"Coastal southeast Florida experiences a wide range of aerosol conditions, including African dust, biomass burning (BB) aerosols, as well as sea salt and other locally-emitted aerosols. These aerosols are important sources of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which play an essential role in governing cloud radiative properties. As marine environments dominate the surface of Earth, CCN characteristics in coastal southeast Florida have broad implications for other regions with the added feature that this site is perturbed by both natural and anthropogenic emissions. This study investigates the influence of different air mass types on CCN concentrations at 0.2% (CCN0.2%) and 1.0% (CCN1.0%) supersaturation (SS) based on ground site measurements during selected months in 2013, 2017, and 2018. Average CCN0.2% and CCN1.0% concentrations were 373 ± 200 cm−3 and 584 ± 323 cm−3, respectively, for four selected days with minimal presence of African dust and BB (i.e., background days). CCN concentrations were not elevated on the four days with highest influence of African dust (289 ± 104 cm−3 [0.2% SS] and 591 ± 302 cm−3 [1.0% SS]), consistent with high dust mass concentrations comprised of coarse particles that are few in number. In contrast, CCN concentrations were substantially enhanced on the five days with the greatest impact from BB (1408 ± 976 cm−3 [0.2% SS] and 3337 ± 1252 cm−3 [1.0% SS]). Ratios of CCN0.2%:CCN1.0% were used to compare the hygroscopicity of the aerosols associated with African dust, BB, and background days. Average ratios were similar for days impacted by African dust and BB (0.54 ± 0.17 and 0.55 ± 0.17, respectively). A 29% higher average ratio was observed on background days (0.71 ± 0.14), owing in part to a strong presence of sea salt and reduced presence of more hydrophobic species such as those of a carbonaceous or mineral-dust nature. Finally, periods of heavy rainfall were shown to effectively decrease both CCN0.2% and CCN1.0% concentrations. However, the rate varied at which such concentrations increased after the rain. This work contributes knowledge on the nucleating ability of African dust and BB in a marine environment after varying periods of atmospheric transport (days to weeks). The results can be used to understand the hygroscopicity of these air mass types, predict how they may influence cloud properties, and provide a valuable model constraint when predicting CCN concentrations in comparable situations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
High-resolution estimation of ambient sulfate concentration over Taiwan Island using a novel ensemble machine-learning model,"Heavy loadings of sulfate aerosol trigger haze formation and pose great damage to human health in Taiwan Island. Nevertheless, high-resolution spatiotemporal variation of ambient sulfate across Taiwan Island still remained unknown because of the scarce monitoring sites. Thus, we developed a novel ensemble model named extreme gradient boosting coupled with geographically and temporally weighted regression (XGBoost-GTWR) to predict the high-resolution sulfate concentration (0.05°) based on satellite data, assimilated meteorology, and the output of chemical transport models (CTMs). The result suggested that XGBoost-GTWR model outperformed other five models in predicting the sulfate concentration with the highest R2 value (R2 = 0.58) and the lowest relative mean square error (RMSE = 1.96 μg/m3). Besides, the transferability of the XGBoost-GTWR model was also validated based on the ground-level sulfate data in 2019. The result suggested that the R2 value of the extrapolation equation (0.53) did not show notable decrease compared with the 10-fold cross-validation result (0.58), indicating that the model was robust to predict the sulfate concentration. The ambient sulfate concentration in Taiwan Island displayed featured spatial variation with the highest one in Southwest Taiwan and the lowest one in Northeast Taiwan, respectively. It was assumed that the higher anthropogenic emission combined with the adverse meteorological condition led to the higher sulfate level in the southwestern coastal region. The ambient sulfate concentration exhibited significantly seasonal variation with the highest value in spring (5.65 ± 0.84 μg/m3), followed by those in winter (5.45 ± 1.25 μg/m3) and autumn (4.60 ± 0.80 μg/m3), and the lowest one in summer (3.80 ± 0.65 μg/m3). The higher sulfate concentration in spring was mainly contributed by the dense biomass burning and scarce rainfall amount. The present study develops a novel model to capture the high-resolution sulfate map and provides basic data for effective regulations of air pollution and epidemiological studies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",,No,No,No
"Roles of RH, aerosol pH and sources in concentrations of secondary inorganic aerosols, during different pollution periods","Secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA, including sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium) were found to be the most dominant aerosol components during haze period. Elucidating the driving factors during liquid-phase reaction formation process of SIA is a key step for understanding the origin of airborne particulate pollution. In this work, we used online instruments and collected hourly concentrations of ions, gases, meteorological parameters in a northern city of China. Source emissions were estimated by receptor model PMF/ME2 pulling run solution (Partial Target Transformation-PMF: PTT-PMF), and six sources were identified (dust, coal combustion, vehicle exhaust, secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate and biomass burning & SOC). pH values were calculated by ISORROPIA-II, with an average value of 4.68. The relationships between RH, pH, source behaviors and concentrations of SIA during different pollution episodes were discussed. Source emissions were found to influence pH and subsequently the SIA; high RH could result in high SIA because aerosol water content in atmosphere increases with RH, which is favorable for liquid-phase reactions. Finally, we employed statistical and machine learning (Random forest classification: RFC) methods to analysis importance of driving factors on SIA formation during different pollution episodes. Results showed precursors, wet conditions, atmospheric oxidation capacity and acidity favor formation of sulfate and nitrate at different pollution levels; changes of gaseous precursors, RH and temperature are more important to determine PM2.5 pollution classification (clean, slightly polluted, moderately polluted, heavily polluted episodes). The findings of this work can provide useful information for better understanding formation mechanism of SIA, mitigating air pollution and improving human health. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
The synoptic skill of aerosol optical depth and angstrom exponent levels over the Mediterranean Basin,"North African desert dust is the dominant aerosol type transported over the Mediterranean Basin (MB), followed by marine, anthropogenic, and biomass-burning aerosol types. This basin is characterized by intense synoptic scale activity that has a substantial impact on the distribution of aerosols. A climatological research at a spatial resolution of 1° × 1° over the MB for the years 2000–2016 is presented here. We used a circulation to environment approach to examine the linkage between three objective circulation type classifications (CTCs) and two outcomes: aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE). This linkage, hereafter referred to as the ‘synoptic skill’, was assessed using tailored autoregressive linear regression and logistic models. We calculated (a) the total synoptic skill, accounting for the contribution of synoptic circulation type and the autoregressive components to AOD variability, and (b) the net synoptic skill, reflecting the contribution of the circulation type only. This novel approach enabled to differentiate between AOD distribution as controlled by the prevailing synoptic conditions to the one affected by climatic diurnal processes. Results for AOD showed maximal total synoptic skill during fall and summer (R2 ∼ 0.3) with highest values over parts of North Africa and the Middle East (R2 > 0.4). The net synoptic skill was highest (R2 ∼ 0.1) during winter and lowest (R2 ∼ 0.05) during summer. Geographic distribution showed low net values over North Africa and the Middle East (R2 < 0.06) and higher values over the Mediterranean Sea (R2 ∼ 0.1). For AE, the synoptic skill had a significant signature over Southern Europe during winter months (c-statistic > 0.8). No single classification was superior in terms of mean synoptic skill, although for specific seasons and geographical locations one or the other of the three classifications showed higher performance. This study reflects some more evidences on the net contribution of CTCs to the distribution of AOD and AE over the MB. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society",,No,No,No
Protective effect of Pinot noir pomace extract against the cytotoxicity induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on endothelial cells,"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are pollutants found in the air generated mainly by the combustion of coal or biomass burning. Exposure to Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons is positively correlated with cardiovascular diseases. Phenolic compounds are widely found in the plant kingdom, and their availability from agri-food processing waste has led to an increased interest in their recovery. The production of large amounts of organic waste created by the wine industry has emphasized the valuation of these wastes to generate high-added-value by-products. The objective of this work was to investigate the protective effect of Pinot noir pomace extract on human endothelial cells against PAHs found in the polluted air of Temuco, Chile. The pomace extract was characterized by spectrophotometric analysis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results revealed the presence of 5 glycosylated anthocyanins and 9 low molecular weight polyphenols. Molecular docking indicated that cyanidin-3-glucoside (−9.2 kcal/mol) and quercetin (−9.6 kcal/mol) had the highest affinities for the Nrf2 binding site in the Keap1 protein, suggesting a possible competition with this transcription factor. Endothelial cells from the human umbilical vein were exposed to increasing concentrations of Phenanthrene, Fluoranthene, and Pyrene diluted in DMSO in a ratio of 3:1:1 (10 μM-200 μM). Viability through the MTS assay showed that 150 μM of PAHs was sufficient to reduce viability by 75% (p ˂ 0.0001). When the cells were pre-treated with 400 μg/ml of the extract, 150 μM of PAHs did not exert cell death (80% viability). Our preliminary results show that polyphenolic components found in Pinot noir pomace might have a beneficial effect as a protective agent. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
First TROPOMI Retrieval of Aerosol Effective Height Using O Absorption Band at 477 nm and Aerosol Classification,"We retrieved aerosol effective height (AEH) values from TROPOspheric monitoring instrument (TROPOMI) measurements based on the O4 absorption at 477 nm. As the first step in the AEH retrieval algorithm, TROPOMI carbon monoxide and aerosol index products were used for the first time to determine aerosol type. An online radiative transfer calculation method was introduced to the AEH retrieval process. The AEHs were retrieved over northeast Asia (various aerosol types), South Africa (biomass-burning smoke), and the Sahara Desert (dust). The retrieved AEHs were compared with AEHs derived using aerosol extinction profiles from ground and satellite-based lidar measurements. A preliminary evaluation based on comparison with lidar suggests reasonable performance, but shows that cloud masking is the main source of uncertainty. The errors associated with the online-based AEH retrieval algorithm were calculated using synthetic radiance. The total AEH retrieval errors were 0.91 km (0.4 ≤ AOD < 1) and 0.30 km (2 ≤ AOD < 3), highlighting the increased sensitivity of the AEH retrieval algorithm under high AOD conditions. This study demonstrates that the O4 absorption band at 477 nm is applicable to aerosol height retrieval from TROPOMI with a high spatial resolution. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",,No,No,No
A weather regime characterisation of winter biomass aerosol transport from southern Africa,"During austral winter, a compact low cloud deck over the South Atlantic contrasts with clear sky over southern Africa, where forest fires triggered by dry conditions emit large amounts of biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) in the free troposphere. Most of the BBA burden crosses the South Atlantic embedded in the tropical easterly flow. However, midlatitude synoptic disturbances can deflect part of the aerosol from the main transport path towards southern extratropics. In this study, the first objective classification of the synoptic variability controlling the spatial distribution of BBA in southern Africa and the South Atlantic during austral winter (August to October) is presented. By analysing atmospheric circulation data from reanalysis products, a six-class weather regime (WR) classification of the region is constructed. The classification reveals that the synoptic variability is composed of four WRs, representing disturbances travelling at midlatitudes, and two WRs accounting for pressure anomalies in the South Atlantic. The WR classification is then successfully used to characterise the aerosol spatial distribution in the region in the period 2003-2017, in both reanalysis products and station data. Results show that the BBA transport towards southern extratropics is controlled by weather regimes associated with midlatitude synoptic disturbances. In particular, depending on the relative position of the pressure anomalies along the midlatitude westerly flow, the BBA transport is deflected from the main tropical route towards southern Africa or the South Atlantic. Moreover, the WRs accounting for midlatitude disturbances show organised transition sequences, which allow one to illustrate the evolution of the BBA northerly transport across the region in the context of a wave pattern. The skill in characterising the BBA transport shown by the WR classification indicates the potential for using it as a diagnostic/predictive tool for the aerosol dynamics, which is a key component for the full understanding and modelling of the complex radiation-aerosol-cloud interactions controlling the atmospheric radiative budget in the region. © 2021 Marco Gaetani et al.",,No,No,No
Dilution impacts on smoke aging: Evidence in Biomass Burning Observation Project (BBOP) data,"Biomass burning emits vapors and aerosols into the atmosphere that can rapidly evolve as smoke plumes travel downwind and dilute, affecting climate- and health-relevant properties of the smoke. To date, theory has been unable to explain observed variability in smoke evolution. Here, we use observational data from the Biomass Burning Observation Project (BBOP) field campaign and show that initial smoke organic aerosol mass concentrations can help predict changes in smoke aerosol aging markers, number concentration, and number mean diameter between 40-262 nm. Because initial field measurements of plumes are generally 10 min downwind, smaller plumes will have already undergone substantial dilution relative to larger plumes and have lower concentrations of smoke species at these observations closest to the fire. The extent to which dilution has occurred prior to the first observation is not a directly measurable quantity. We show that initial observed plume concentrations can serve as a rough indicator of the extent of dilution prior to the first measurement, which impacts photochemistry, aerosol evaporation, and coagulation. Cores of plumes have higher concentrations than edges. By segregating the observed plumes into cores and edges, we find evidence that particle aging, evaporation, and coagulation occurred before the first measurement. We further find that on the plume edges, the organic aerosol is more oxygenated, while a marker for primary biomass burning aerosol emissions has decreased in relative abundance compared to the plume cores. Finally, we attempt to decouple the roles of the initial concentrations and physical age since emission by performing multivariate linear regression of various aerosol properties (composition, size) on these two factors. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Elucidating an atmospheric brown carbon species-toward supplanting chemical intuition with exhaustive enumeration and machine learning,"Brown carbon (BrC) is involved in atmospheric light absorption and climate forcing and can cause adverse health effects. Understanding the formation mechanisms and molecular structure of BrC is of key importance in developing strategies to control its environment and health impact. Structure determination of BrC is challenging, due to the lack of experiments providing molecular fingerprints and the sheer number of molecular candidates with identical mass. Suggestions based on chemical intuition are prone to errors due to the inherent bias. We present an unbiased algorithm, using graph-based molecule generation and machine learning, which can identify all molecular structures of compounds involved in biomass burning and the composition of BrC. We apply this algorithm to C12H12O7, a light-absorbing ' test case' molecule identified in chamber experiments on the aqueous photo-oxidation of syringol, a prevalent marker in wood smoke. Of the 260 million molecular graphs, the algorithm leaves only 36,518 (0.01%) as viable candidates matching the spectrum. Although no unique molecular structure is obtained from only a chemical formula and a UV/vis absorption spectrum, we discuss further reduction strategies and their efficacy. With additional data, the method can potentially more rapidly identify isomers extracted from lab and field aerosol particles without introducing human bias. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,No,No,No
Application of multi-response robust parameter design for performance optimization of a hybrid draft biomass cook stove,"A novel design of a hybrid draft biomass cook stove was proposed, constructed and tested for 54 combinations of five important parameters viz. Inlet area ratio, Fuel surface to volume ratio, Pot diameter, Secondary air flow rate, and Pot gap. The combined effects of these factors on the stove performance parameters such as overall efficiency (ηo), CO emissions and PM2.5 emissions were estimated. The data obtained by executing designed experiments (CCD) on the stove prototype was fitted to independent second-order models using RSM. The fitted models were further used to predict the stove performance for different combinations of the five factors. The analysis revealed that the prototype cannot achieve energy performance better than Tier 2 level and ηo greater than 30%. However, the hybrid draft enabled the prototype to achieve Tier 4 level performance in CO and PM2.5 emissions. Desirability function coupled with the fitted RSM models was used for robust parameter optimization of the stove performance to maximize efficiency, minimize emissions and propagation of error. The robust parameter optimization resulted in the best possible overall stove performance of ηo = 26.54%, CO/MJd = 2.249 g/MJ and PM/MJd = 34.67 mg/MJd obtained at the control factor levels of Ms = 1.74 g/s and Pg = 14 mm. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Toxicity of selected airborne nitrophenols on eukaryotic cell membrane models,"Nitroaromatics belong to the group of toxic components of aerosol particles and atmospheric hydrometeors that enter the atmosphere through biomass burning and fuel combustion. In the present work, we report on the cytotoxic effects of a 2-, 3- and 4-nitrophenol mixture on a model eukaryotic-like cell membrane and compared it with in vitro cellular models BEAS-2B (immortalized bronchial epithelial cells) and A549 (cancerous alveolar epithelial cells). A selected model biomembrane comprised of DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) was studied. The electrochemical-based method, combined with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and phase-contrast microscopy imaging, allowed to get insights into the mechanism of cellular function disruption caused by airborne nitrophenols. The efficacy of the method is supported by the data obtained from in vitro experiments performed on cell models. The nitrophenol mixture exhibited cytotoxic effects at concentrations above 100 μg mL−1, as demonstrated by phase-contrast microscopy in real lung cell lines. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed the formation of membrane defects at a nitrophenol concentration of 200 μg mL−1. AFM imaging confirmed the model membrane disintegration and phospholipids rearrangement in the presence of nitrophenols. These observations indicate that particle-bound nitrophenols induce substantial changes in cell membranes and make them more permeable to aerosol, resulting in major cellular damage in the lungs when inhaled. The study provides initial evidence of cellular membrane damage induced by three important nitrated phenols present in the environment. © 2020 The Authors",,No,No,No
Distribution of Bioaerosols in Association With Particulate Matter: A Review on Emerging Public Health Threat in Asian Megacities,"Occurrences and exposure to high levels of microbial bioaerosols such as pathogenic bacteria, fungi, fungal spores, and viruses can be linked to the deterioration of the environment and public health. This study aimed to review the results available for the unusual bioaerosol distribution scenario in the Asian regions. The amount of bioaerosol load and their environmental behavior in the atmosphere is heavily influenced by air pollution such as haze, fog, dust, and particulate matter (PM) and thus strongly affect the air quality index (AQI). Human factors such as heavy traffic, overcrowds, and biomass burning also affected the prevalence or occurrences of bioaerosols in the atmosphere. Seasonal/temporal and diurnal variation was significantly observed from these studies and in the case of South Asia, post-monsoon and winter months were incredibly concentrated with pathogenic bioaerosols. Many human infections, for example, pneumonia, tuberculosis, brucellosis, anthrax, and query fever (Q-fever), are linked to pathogenic bacterial bioaerosols. Respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic pulmonary obstructiveness are related to fungal bioaerosols, spores, and viral infections. To facilitate the testing and monitoring appraisal of airborne bioaerosols, artificial intelligence, deep neural networks, and machine learning can be used to develop real-time PCR-based bioaerosol sensors. Moreover, mobile apps and compatible electronic gadgets can be developed for the city dwellers to real-time monitor the concentration of bioaerosols in the air they are breathing. © Copyright © 2021 Shammi, Rahman and Tareq.",,No,No,No
Radiative heating rate profiles over the southeast Atlantic Ocean during the 2016 and 2017 biomass burning seasons,"Marine boundary layer clouds, including the transition from stratocumulus to cumulus, are poorly represented in numerical weather prediction and general circulation models. Further uncertainties in the cloud structure arise in the presence of biomass burning carbonaceous aerosol, as is the case over the southeast Atlantic Ocean, where biomass burning aerosol is transported from the African continent. As the aerosol plume progresses across the southeast Atlantic Ocean, radiative heating within the aerosol layer has the potential to alter the thermodynamic environment and therefore the cloud structure; however, limited work has been done to quantify this along the trajectory of the aerosol plume in the region. The deployment of the first Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility (AMF1) in support of the Layered Atlantic Smoke Interactions with Clouds field campaign provided a unique opportunity to collect observations of cloud and aerosol properties during two consecutive biomass burning seasons during July through October of 2016 and 2017 over Ascension Island (7.96- S, 14.35- W). Using observed profiles of temperature, humidity, and clouds from the field campaign alongside aerosol optical properties from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), as input for the Rapid Radiation Transfer Model (RRTM), profiles of the radiative heating rate due to aerosols and clouds were computed. Radiative heating is also assessed across the southeast Atlantic Ocean using an ensemble of back trajectories from the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Idealized experiments using the RRTM with and without aerosols and a range of values for the single-scattering albedo (SSA) demonstrate that shortwave (SW) heating within the aerosol layer above Ascension Island can locally range between 2 and 8Kd-1 depending on the aerosol optical properties, though impacts of the aerosol can be felt elsewhere in the atmospheric column. When considered under clear conditions, the aerosol has a cooling effect at the TOA, and based on the observed cloud properties at Ascension Island, the cloud albedo is not large enough to overcome this. Shortwave radiative heating due to biomass burning aerosol is not balanced by additional longwave (LW) cooling, and the net radiative impact results in a stabilization of the lower troposphere. However, these results are extremely sensitive to the single-scattering albedo assumptions in models.. © 2020 Laser Institute of America. All rights reserved.",,No,No,No
Substantial changes in gaseous pollutants and chemical compositions in fine particles in the North China Plain during the COVID-19 lockdown period: Anthropogenic vs. meteorological influences,"The rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented decreases in economic activities, thereby reducing the pollutant emissions. A random forest (RF) model was applied to determine the respective contributions of meteorology and anthropogenic emissions to the changes in air quality. The result suggested that the strict lockdown measures significantly decreased primary components such as Cr (-67 %) and Fe (-61 %) in PM2:5 (p < 0:01), whereas the higher relative humidity (RH) and NH3 level and the lower air temperature (T) remarkably enhanced the production of secondary aerosol, including SO24-(29 %), NO-3 (29 %), and NHC 4 (21 %) (p < 0:05). The positive matrix factorization (PMF) result suggested that the contribution ratios of secondary formation (SF), industrial process (IP), biomass burning (BB), coal combustion (CC), and road dust (RD) changed from 36 %, 27 %, 21 %, 12 %, and 4 % before the COVID-19 outbreak to 44 %, 20 %, 20 %, 9 %, and 7 %, respectively. The rapid increase in the contribution ratio derived from SF to PM2:5 implied that the intermittent haze events during the COVID-19 period were characterized by secondary aerosol pollution, which was mainly contributed by the unfavorable meteorological conditions and high NH3 level. © 2021 Rui Li et al.",,No,No,No
"Land use regression modeling for fine particulate matters in Bangkok, Thailand, using time-variant predictors: Effects of seasonal factors, open biomass burning, and traffic-related factors","In recent years, as the level of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration has become more closely monitored in Thailand and its harmful effects on health have been widely recognized by the public, the Thai government has debated various measures to improve air quality. In this paper, the Land Use Regression (LUR) technique was used to model the relationship between the daily PM2.5 concentration and various predictor variables using data from the entire year of 2019. The results confirmed strong seasonal effects on PM2.5 and substantial effects of time-variant predictors, including open biomass burning and meteorological conditions. However, time-invariant variables, including traffic, transportation, and land use characteristics were generally weaker predictors in the LUR models. The results of the model based on data for the entire year showed better statistical fit and robustness than the seasonal models. The relatively low adjusted R2 of the models developed in this study compared with previous LUR studies suggests that more detailed data, especially the traffic volume on roads nearby monitoring sites, might be necessary to improve the model's performance. Finally, the large buffer size of the open biomass burning predictor implied that the measures to reduce PM2.5 by limiting open biomass burning would require international cooperation as some fires within the buffer area occurred in neighboring countries outside the borders of Thailand. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
"A case study on the vertical distribution and characteristics of aerosols using ground-based raman lidar, satellite and model over Western India","Ahmedabad is an urban site in western region of India. Dust loading and its variability are very high over this semi-arid location. A state-of-the-art ground-based Raman lidar has been used for the study of day-to-day variability in vertical distribution of aerosol loading over Ahmedabad (23.02° N, 72.57° E) from 8 to 11 May 2018. We have done a comprehensive study about vertical profiles of aerosols across two wavelengths recorded simultaneously, namely, 355 nm and 532 nm, over this location. An interesting hump feature has been noted on 9 May at around 18 h (Local Time), with an additional peak at 19 h on 10 May. The loading over this region has more fine-mode aerosols than coarse-mode particles. Further, findings from ground-based lidar have been compared with MACC-II model simulations and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization on-board Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observational. Back-trajectory analysis showed majority of the influx came from middle-east, carrying mineral dust and traces of marine aerosols from Arabian Sea, except for 11 May, where low-level dust carrying trajectories and also coarser dust particles were not seen. This type of manifestation has also been observed while classifying aerosols over Ahmedabad using Lidar Depolarization Ratio and Lidar Ratio obtained from Raman Lidar. Fine mode aerosols have been characterized as industrial, vehicular and marine, while coarser as mineral dust and biomass burning. This study focuses on local variation and classification of aerosols based on size and type, which will further help in better estimation of radiative budget and other impacts of aerosols. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,No,No,No
Atmospheric Processing of Nitrophenols and Nitrocresols From Biomass Burning Emissions,"We present the analysis of the atmospheric budget of nitrophenols and nitrocresols, a class of nitroaromatics that raise great ecosystem and health concerns due to their phytotoxic and genotoxic properties, during the spring wheat harvest season in Eastern China. Significant quantities with maximum concentrations over 100 pptv and distinct diurnal patterns that peak around midnight and maintain low levels throughout the day were observed, in coincidence with the extensive open crop residue burning activities conducted in the vicinity. An observationally constrained zero-dimension box model was constructed to assess the relative importance of various production and removal pathways at play in determining the measured surface concentrations. The NO3-initiated dark chemistry, in concert with meteorological variations predominantly dilution and entrainment, exerts major controls over the observed diurnal behaviors of nitrophenols and nitrocresols. Structural isomerism is predicted to have a significant impact on the multiphase partitioning and chemistry of nitrophenol isomers. Furthermore, simulations show that an appreciable amount of nitrophenols is present in the aerosol water, thereby representing an important source of water-soluble brown carbon in atmospheric aerosols under the humid subtropical weather prevailing during the campaign. Sensitivity analysis performed on the model parameterizations of reaction schemes helps to further understand the chemistry underlying the diurnal cycles. Implementing NO-dependent yields of cresols from toluene photooxidation improves the model predictions of nitrocresols at low NO ranges (<1 ppb), thereby underscoring the complexity of the peroxy radical reaction pathways from toluene photooxidation under atmospheric relevant conditions. ©2020.

Characterization of aerosol sources in León (Spain) using Positive Matrix Factorization and weather types,"A one-year aerosol sampling campaign, between 2016 and 2017, was conducted in a suburban area of León city, Spain. An association between the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) results and air masses through circulation weather types was carried out, through the construction of linear models from the PM10 concentrations and its chemical composition. The aerosol sources, identified by PMF six-factor solution, were: traffic (29%), aged sea salt (26%), secondary aerosols (16%), dust (13%), marine aerosol (7%) and biomass burning (3%). Traffic and secondary factors showed the highest PM10 contribution in the hybrid cyclonic types with wind component from the first and second quadrant. Anticyclonic types with wind component from the first quadrant exhibited high values of secondary, aged sea salt and dust factors. The highest contributions of the dust factor were also associated with northerly types. The linear models built for estimating the source apportionment of PM10, from aerosol chemical composition and geostrophic flow, showed positive coefficients for: westerly flows (WF) in marine factor, southerly flows (SF) in secondary and traffic factors, and shear southerly vorticities (ZS) in dust factor. Negative dependences were observed for ZS in aged sea salt factor and for SF in dust factor. The PM10 mass concentration calculated by the linear models and by the PMF model were strongly correlated. This can be very useful to determine the contribution of a specific source to PM10 in León, only by knowing some meteorological and chemical variables. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,No,No,No
Assessing the emission sources and reduction potential of atmospheric ammonia at an urban site in Northeast China,"Atmospheric ammonium and ammonia have brought negative environmental impacts and adverse health effects. However, ammonia emissions are generally less regulated worldwide. This study analyzed ammonium pollution character, quantified the dominant ammonia emission sources, and assessed ammonia reduction potential in urban Harbin (China). The results showed that ammonium recorded low concentration in the non-heating season (1.34 ± 1.57 μg/m3), and recorded sharply increased concentration (6.50 ± 7.02 μg/m3) and relative abundance in the heating season. It was closely correlated with vehicle-related pollutants (CO) in non-heating season, while with biomass burning-related pollutants (K+, Cl−) in the heating season. Bayesian Mixing Model emphasized the increasing contribution of biomass burning and decreasing contribution of fertilizer as the pollution levels escalate. The results from the thermodynamic equilibrium model showed that a 50%–60% ammonium decrease could bring marketable decrements of the aerosol pH, aerosol water content, ammonium nitrate concentration, and inorganic ion mass. The results of this study would provide scientific bases for ammonia emission reduction and haze pollution control in urban Harbin. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",,No,No,No
Molecular Dynamics and Light Absorption Properties of Atmospheric Dissolved Organic Matter,"The light-absorbing organic aerosol referred to as brown carbon (BrC) affects the global radiative balance. The linkages between its molecular composition and light absorption properties and how environmental factors influence BrC composition are not well understood. In this study, atmospheric dissolved organic matter (ADOM) in 55 aerosol samples from Guangzhou was characterized using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and light absorption measurements. The abundant components in ADOM were aliphatics and peptide-likes (in structure), or nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds (in elemental composition). The light absorption properties of ADOM were positively correlated with the levels of unsaturated and aromatic structures. Particularly, 17 nitrogen-containing species, which are identified by a random forest, characterized the variation of BrC absorption well. Aggregated boosted tree model and nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis show that the BrC composition was largely driven by meteorological conditions and anthropogenic activities, among which biomass burning (BB) and OH radical were the two important factors. BrC compounds often accumulate with elevated BB emissions and related secondary processes, whereas the photolysis/photooxidation of BrC usually occurs under high solar radiance/•OH concentration. This study first illuminated how environmental factors influence BrC at the molecular level and provided clues for the molecular-level research of BrC in the future.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,No,No,No
High-resolution seasonal and decadal inventory of anthropogenic gas-phase and particle emissions for Argentina,"This work presents the integration of a gas-phase and particulate atmospheric emission inventory (AEI) for Argentina in high spatial resolution (0.025×0.025; approx. 2.5km×2.5 km) considering monthly variability from 1995 to 2020. The new inventory, called GEAA-AEIv3.0M, includes the following activities: Energy production, fugitive emissions from oil and gas production, industrial fuel consumption and production, transport (road, maritime, and air), agriculture, livestock production, manufacturing, residential, commercial, and biomass and agricultural waste burning. The following species, grouped by atmospheric reactivity, are considered: (i) greenhouse gases (GHGs)-CO2, CH4, and N2O; (ii) ozone precursors-CO, NOx (NO+NO2), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs); (iii) acidifying gases-NH3 and SO2; and (iv) particulate matter (PM)-PM10, PM2.5, total suspended particles (TSPs), and black carbon (BC). The main objective of the GEAA-AEIv3.0M high-resolution emission inventory is to provide temporally resolved emission maps to support air quality and climate modeling oriented to evaluate pollutant mitigation strategies by local governments. This is of major concern, especially in countries where air quality monitoring networks are scarce, and the development of regional and seasonal emissions inventories would result in remarkable improvements in the time and space chemical prediction achieved by air quality models. Despite distinguishing among different sectoral and activity databases as well as introducing a novel spatial distribution approach based on census radii, our high-resolution GEAA-AEIv3.0M shows equivalent national-wide total emissions compared to the Third National Communication of Argentina (TNCA), which compiles annual GHG emissions from 1990 through 2014 (agreement within ±7.5%). However, the GEAA-AEIv3.0M includes acidifying gases and PM species not considered in TNCA. Temporal comparisons were also performed against two international databases: Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) and EDGAR HTAPv5.0 for several pollutants; for EDGAR it also includes a spatial comparison. The agreement was acceptable within less than 30% for most of the pollutants and activities, although a >90% discrepancy was obtained for methane from fuel production and fugitive emissions and >120% for biomass burning. Finally, the updated seasonal series clearly showed the pollution reduction due to the COVID-19 lockdown during the first quarter of year 2020 with respect to same months in previous years. Through an open-access data repository, we present the GEAA-AEIv3.0M inventory as the largest and more detailed spatial resolution dataset for the Argentine Republic, which includes monthly gridded emissions for 12 species and 15 stors between 1995 and 2020.

Instrumental Variable Analysis in Atmospheric and Aerosol Chemistry,"Due to the complex nature of ambient aerosols arising from the presence of myriads of organic compounds, the chemical reactivity of a particular compound with oxidant/s are studied through chamber experiments under controlled laboratory conditions. Several confounders (RH, T, light intensity, in chamber retention time) are controlled in chamber experiments to study their effect on the chemical transformation of a reactant (exposure variable) and the outcome [kinetic rate constant determination, new product/s formation e.g., secondary organic aerosol (SOA), product/s yield, etc.]. However, under ambient atmospheric conditions, it is not possible to control for these confounders which poses a challenge in assessing the outcome/s accurately. The approach of data interpretation must include randomization for an accurate prediction of the real-world scenario. One of the ways to achieve randomization is possible by the instrumental variable analysis (IVA). In this study, the IVA analysis revealed that the average ratio of fSOC/O3 (ppb−1) was 0.0032 (95% CI: 0.0009, 0.0055) and 0.0033 (95% CI: 0.0001, 0.0065) during daytime of Diwali and Post-Diwali period. However, during rest of the study period the relationship between O3 and fSOC was found to be insignificant. Based on IVA in conjunction with the concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT), cluster analysis, and fire count imageries, causal effect of O3 on SOA formation has been inferred for the daytime when emissions from long-range transport of biomass burning influenced the receptor site. To the best of our knowledge, the IVA has been applied for the first time in this study in the field of atmospheric and aerosol chemistry. © Copyright © 2020 Rajput and Gupta.",,No,No,No
Simulation of the evolution of biomass burning organic aerosol with different volatility basis set schemes in PMCAMx-SRv1.0,"A source-resolved three-dimensional chemical transport model, PMCAMx-SR (Particulate Matter Comprehensive Air-quality Model with extensions - Source Resolved), was applied in the continental US to investigate the contribution of the various components (primary and secondary) of biomass burning organic aerosol (bbOA) to organic aerosol levels. Two different schemes based on the volatility basis set were used for the simulation of the bbOA during different seasons. The first is the default scheme of PMCAMx-SR, and the second is a recently developed scheme based on laboratory experiments of the bbOA evolution./ The simulations with the alternative bbOA scheme predict much higher total bbOA concentrations when compared with the base case ones. This is mainly due to the high emissions of intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) assumed in the alternative scheme. The oxidation of these compounds is predicted to be a significant source of secondary organic aerosol. The impact of the other parameters that differ in the two schemes is low to negligible. The monthly average maximum predicted concentrations of the alternative bbOA scheme were approximately an order of magnitude higher than those of the default scheme during all seasons./ The performance of the two schemes was evaluated against observed total organic aerosol concentrations from several measurement sites across the US. The results were different for the different seasons examined. The default scheme performed better during July and September, while the alternative scheme performed a little better during April. These results illustrate the uncertainty of the corresponding predictions and the need to quantify the emissions and reactions of IVOCs from specific biomass sources and to better constrain the total (primary and secondary) bbOA levels. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

"Global emissions of NH3, NOx, and N2O from biomass burning and the impact of climate change","Emissions of ammonia (NH3), oxides of nitrogen (NOx; NO +NO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from biomass burning were quantified on a global scale for 2001 to 2015. On average biomass burning emissions at a global scale over the period were as follows: 4.53 ± 0.51 Tg NH3 year−1, 14.65 ± 1.60 Tg NOx year−1, and 0.97 ± 0.11 Tg N2O year−1. Emissions were comparable to other emissions databases. Statistical regression models were developed to project NH3, NOx, and N2O emissions from biomass burning as a function of burn area. Two future climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) were analyzed for 2050–2055 (“mid-century”) and 2090–2095 (“end of century”). Under the assumptions made in this study, the results indicate emissions of all species are projected to increase under both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate scenarios. Implications: This manuscript quantifies emissions of NH3, NOx, and N2O on a global scale from biomass burning from 2001–2015 then creates regression models to predict emissions based on climate change. Because reactive nitrogen emissions have such an important role in the global nitrogen cycle, changes in these emissions could lead to a number of health and environmental impacts. © 2020 A&WMA.",,No,No,No
Impact of the variability in vertical separation between biomass burning aerosols and marine stratocumulus on cloud microphysical properties over the Southeast Atlantic,"Marine stratocumulus cloud properties over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean are impacted by contact between above-cloud biomass burning aerosols and cloud tops. Different vertical separations (0 to 2000 m) between the aerosol layer and cloud tops were observed on six research flights in September 2016 during the NASA ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) field campaign. There were 30 contact profiles, where an aerosol layer with aerosol concentration (Na) > 500 cm-3 was within 100 m of cloud tops, and 41 separated profiles, where the aerosol layer with Na > 500 cm-3 was located more than 100 m above cloud tops. For contact profiles, the average cloud droplet concentration (Nc) in the cloud layer was up to 68 cm-3 higher, the effective radius (Re) up to 1.3 μ m lower, and the liquid water content (LWC) within 0.01 gm-3 compared to separated profiles. Free-tropospheric humidity was higher in the presence of biomass burning aerosols, and contact profiles had a smaller decrease in humidity (and positive buoyancy) across cloud tops with higher median above-cloud Na (895 cm-3) compared to separated profiles (30 cm-3). Due to droplet evaporation from entrainment mixing of warm, dry free-tropospheric air into the clouds, the median Nc and LWC for contact profiles decreased with height by 21 and 9 % in the top 20 % of the cloud layer. The impact of droplet evaporation was stronger during separated profiles as a greater decrease in humidity (and negative buoyancy) across cloud tops led to greater decreases in median Nc (30 %) and LWC (16 %) near cloud tops. Below-cloud Na was sampled during 61 profiles, and most contact profiles (20 out of 28) were within high-Na (> 350 cm-3) boundary layers, while most separated profiles (22 out of 33) were within low-Na (< 350 cm-3) boundary layers. Although the differences in below-cloud Na were statistically insignificant, contact profiles within lowNa boundary layers had up to 34.9 cm-3 higher Nc compared to separated profiles. This is consistent with a weaker impact of droplet evaporation in the presence of biomass burning aerosols within 100 m above cloud tops. For contact profiles within high-Na boundary layers, the presence of biomass burning aerosols led to higher below-cloud Na (up to 70.5 cm-3) and additional droplet nucleation above the cloud base along with weaker droplet evaporation. Con sequently, the contact profiles in high-Na boundary layers had up to 88.4 cm-3 higher Nc compared to separated profiles. These results motivate investigations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions over the Southeast Atlantic since the changes in Nc and Re induced by the presence of abovecloud biomass burning aerosols are likely to impact precipitation rates, liquid water path, and cloud fraction, and modulate closed-to-open-cell transitions. © 2021 Author(s).",,No,No,No
Modeling biomass burning organic aerosol atmospheric evolution and chemical aging,"The changes in the concentration and composition of biomass-burning organic aerosol (OA) downwind of a major wildfire are simulated using the one-dimensional Lagrangian chemical transport model PMCAMx-Trj. A base case scenario is developed based on realistic fire-plume conditions and a series of sensitivity tests are performed to quantify the effects of different conditions and processes. Temperature, oxidant concentration and dilution rate all affect the evolution of biomass burning OA after its emission. The most important process though is the multi-stage oxidation of both the originally emitted organic vapors (volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds) and those resulting from the evaporation of the OA as it is getting diluted. The emission rates of the intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) and their chemical fate have a large impact on the formed secondary OA within the plume. The assumption that these IVOCs undergo only functionalization leads to an overestimation of the produced SOA suggesting that fragmentation is also occurring. Assuming a fragmentation probability of 0.2 resulted in predictions that are more consistent with available observations. Dilution leads to OA evaporation and therefore reduction of the OA levels downwind of the fire. However, the evaporated material can return to the particulate phase later on after it gets oxidized and recondenses. The sensitivity of the OA levels and total mass balance on the dilution rate depends on the modeling assumptions. The high variability of OA mass enhancement observed in past field studies downwind of fires may be partially due to the variability of the dilution rates of the plumes. © 2021 by the authors.

Phase transformation of silica particles in coal and biomass combustion processes,"Inhalation of respirable silica particles can cause serious lung diseases (e.g., silicosis and lung cancer), and the toxicity of respirable silica is highly dependent on its crystal form. Common combustion processes such as coal and biomass burning can provide high temperature environments that may alter the crystal forms of silica and thus affect its toxic effects. Although crystalline silica (i.e., quartz, tridymite, and cristobalite) were widely found at different temperatures during the burning processes, the sources and crystal transformation pathways of silica in the burning processes are still not well understood. Here, we investigate the crystal transformation of silica in the coal and biomass combustion processes and clarify the detailed transformation pathways of silica for the first time. Specifically, in coal burning process, amorphous silica can transform into quartz and cristobalite starting at 1100 °C, and quartz transforms into cristobalite starting at 1200 °C; in biomass burning process, amorphous silica can transform into cristobalite starting at 800 °C, and cristobalite transforms into tridymite starting at 1000 °C. These transformation temperatures are significantly lower than those predicted by the classic theory due to possibly the catalysis of coexisting metal elements (e.g., aluminum, iron, and potassium). Our results not only enable a deeper understanding on the combustion-induced crystal transformation of silica, but also contribute to the mitigation of population exposure to respirable silica. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Observed changes in fire patterns and possible drivers over Central Africa,"Fire is an integral part of Earth's system that links regional and global biogeochemical cycles, human activities, and ecosystems. Global estimates for biomass burning indicate that Africa is responsible for ∼70% of global burned area and ∼50% of fire-related carbon emissions. Previous studies have documented an overall decline in burned area in the African continent, but changes in fire patterns, such as the frequency and size of different fire categories, have not been assessed. In this study, long-Term fire trends were investigated using the latest burned area data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Global Fire Emission Database (GFED4s) over Central Africa (10°E-40°E, 15°N-15°S). A 3D (latitude, longitude, time) connected-component labeling algorithm was applied to identify individual fires and their sizes. The results show a decline in burned area by 2.7-3.2 Mha yr-1 (∼1.3% yr-1) for the period 2003-2017, particularly in northern Central Africa. This decline was attributed to significant decreases in both fire frequency and size, particularly for large fires (>100 ha) which contribute to ∼90% of the total burned area. Burned area declined in tropical savannas and grasslands but increased at the edges of the Congolese rainforest. A random forest regression model was applied to quantify the influences of climatic conditions, fuel availability, and agricultural activity on burned area changes. Overall, suppressed fuel, increased dry season length, and decreased rainfall contributed to significant declines in burned area in savannas and grasslands. At the edges of the southern Congolese rainforest, suppressed rainfall and warmer temperature were responsible for the increased burned area. © 2020 The Author(s).

Atmospheric wet deposition of major ionic constituents and inorganic nitrogen in Bangladesh: Implications for spatiotemporal variation and source apportionment,"The quantitative and qualitative characterization of ions and inorganic nitrogen in precipitation assists in understanding the accompanying sources and chemistry of regional precipitation. A total of 212 event-based precipitation samples were collected from four sites in Bangladesh in 2017 to investigate the physicochemical characteristics, sources, and deposition of atmospheric ionic constituents and inorganic nitrogen. During the entire monitoring period, 5.7% of the total samples were acidic (i.e., pH < 5.6), indicating that Bangladesh does not suffer severely from acid rain. The electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) values indicate the inverse relationship between the amount of precipitation on the spatiotemporal scale. Ca2+ was the dominant neutralizing factor at four sites, which was demonstrated by the equivalent ratio of the neutralization potential to the acidifying potential and fractional acidity. Moreover, it had the highest volume-weighted mean concentration of all the sites, validating the calcareous nature of the soil aerosolized into the atmosphere. Distinct seasonality was observed for the majority of the ions with higher concentrations in the non-monsoon climate. Sea salt species displayed the pattern of Satkhira > Cox's Bazar > Dinajpur > Sylhet, whereas the anthropogenic species exhibited the order of Dinajpur > Satkhira > Sylhet > Cox's Bazar, underlining the local and regional impacts of these species in Bangladesh. Based on the source apportionment, the sources were categorized as marine (Na+ and Cl−), terrigenous (Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO3−), fossil fuel combustion (NO3− and SO42−), agriculture (NH4+), and biomass burning (K+). The Cl− in Sylhet and Satkhira suggests additional sources associated with anthropogenic activities. The back-trajectory analyses and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's final (NCEP FNL) datasets illustrate the presence of significantly diverse air masses with contributions from various sources in the monsoon and non-monsoon climates. Both the amount of precipitation and the ionic quantity governs the fluxes in Bangladesh. The Na+ % and SAR lie under the safe category suggesting a good precipitation water quality for agriculture and soil in Bangladesh, while the deposition of inorganic nitrogen has resulted in a value above the threshold line (10 kg ha−1 y−1). Thus, this study conveys a comprehensive picture of the ionic composition, providing a baseline dataset to assess the atmospheric environment in this lowland region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,No,No,No
The toxic effect of water-soluble particulate pollutants from biomass burning on alveolar lung cells,"In 2018, 3.8 million premature deaths were attributed to exposure to biomass burning nanoparticles from wood combustion. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare the toxic effect of wood-combustion-related biomass burning nanoparticles from three different combustion stages (i.e., flaming, smoldering, and pyrolysis) on alveolar lung cells, by studying cell proliferation, and structural and behavioral parameters. A549 lung epithelial cells were treated with 31, 62, 125, 250, and 500 µg/mL of water-soluble particulate pollutants from wood burning, and measured by means of real-time cell analysis, cell imaging, and phase imaging microscopy. At low concentrations (31 and 62 µg/mL), all three types of wood burning samples exhibited no toxicity. At 125 µg/mL, they caused decreased cell proliferation compared to the control. Exposure to higher concentrations (250 and 500 µg/mL) killed the cells. Cell physical parameters (area, optical volume, eccentricity, perimeter, and optical thickness) and behavioral parameters (migration, motility, and motility speed) did not change in response to exposure to wood burning materials up to a concentration of 125 µg/mL. Exposure to higher concentrations (250 and 500 µg/mL) changed cell perimeter, optical thickness for smoldering and flaming particles, and led to decreased migration, motility, and motility speed of cells. In conclusion, all three of the combustion water-soluble organic pollutants were identified as equally toxic by real-time cell analysis (RTCA) results. The parameters describing cell structure suggest that pyrolysis particles were slightly less toxic than others. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,No,No,No
Cloud condensation nuclei characteristics at the southern great plains site: Role of particle size distribution and aerosol hygroscopicity,"The activation ability of aerosols as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) is crucial in climate and hydrological cycle studies, but their properties are not well known. We investigated the long-term measurements of atmospheric aerosol properties, CCN concentrations (NCCN) at supersaturation (SS = 0.1%-1.0%), and hygroscopicity at the Department of Energy's Southern Great Plains (SGP) site to illustrate the dependence of NCCN on aerosol properties and transport pathways. Cluster analysis was applied to the back trajectories of air masses to investigate their respective source regions. The results showed that aged biomass burning aerosols from Central America were characterized by higher accumulation mode particles (Naccu; median value 805 cm-3) and relatively high aerosol hygroscopicity (κ; median value ~0.25) values that result in the higher CCN activation and relatively high NCCN (median value 258-1578 cm-3 at a SS of 0.1%-1.0%). Aerosols from the Gulf of Mexico were characterized by higher Naccu (~35%), and NCCN (230-1721 cm-3 at a SS of 0.1%-1.0%) with the lowest κ (~0.17). In contrast, relatively high nucleation mode particles (Nnucl; ~20%) and low NCCN (128-1553 cm-3 at a SS of 0.1%-1.0%) with higher κ (~0.30) values were observed on the aerosols associated with a westerly wind. The results indicate particle size as the most critical factor influencing the ability of aerosols to activate, whereas the effect of chemical composition was secondary. Our CCN closure analysis suggests that chemical composition and mixing state information are more crucial at lower SS, whereas at higher SS, most particles become activated regardless of their chemical composition and size. This study affirms that soluble organic fraction information is required at higher SS for better NCCN prediction, but both the soluble organics fraction and mixing state are vital to reduce the NCCN prediction uncertainty at lower SS. © 2021 The Author(s).

Past Variance and Future Projections of the Environmental Conditions Driving Western U.S. Summertime Wildfire Burn Area,"Increases in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) have been hypothesized as the primary driver of future fire changes. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models agree that western U.S. surface temperatures and associated dryness of air as defined by the VPD will increase in the 21st century for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. However, we find that averaged over seasonal and regional scales, other environmental variables demonstrated to be relevant to flammability, moisture abundances, and aridity—such as precipitation, evaporation, relative humidity, root zone soil moisture, and wind speed—can be used to explain observed variance in wildfire burn area as well or better than VPD. However, the magnitude and sign of the change of these variables in the 21st century are less certain than the predicted changes in VPD. Our work demonstrates that when objectively selecting environmental variables to maximize predictive skill of linear regressions (minimize square error on unseen data) VPD is not always selected and when it is not, the magnitude of future increases in burn area becomes less certain. Hence, this work shows that future burn area predictions are sensitive to what environmental predictors are chosen to drive burn area. ©2020. The Authors.",,No,No,No
Source Quantification of South Asian Black Carbon Aerosols with Isotopes and Modeling,"Black carbon (BC) aerosols perturb climate and impoverish air quality/human health - affecting ?1.5 billion people in South Asia. However, the lack of source-diagnostic observations of BC is hindering the evaluation of uncertain bottom-up emission inventories (EIs) and thereby also models/policies. Here, we present dual-isotope-based (?14C/?13C) fingerprinting of wintertime BC at two receptor sites of the continental outflow. Our results show a remarkable similarity in contributions of biomass and fossil combustion, both from the site capturing the highly populated highly polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain footprint (IGP; ?14C-fbiomass = 50 ± 3%) and the second site in the N. Indian Ocean representing a wider South Asian footprint (52 ± 6%). Yet, both sites reflect distinct ?13C-fingerprints, indicating a distinguishable contribution of C4-biomass burning from peninsular India (PI). Tailored-model-predicted season-averaged BC concentrations (700 ± 440 ng m-3) match observations (740 ± 250 ng m-3), however, unveiling a systematically increasing model-observation bias (+19% to -53%) through winter. Inclusion of BC from open burning alone does not reconcile predictions (fbiomass = 44 ± 8%) with observations. Direct source-segregated comparison reveals regional offsets in anthropogenic emission fluxes in EIs, overestimated fossil-BC in the IGP, and underestimated biomass-BC in PI, which contributes to the model-observation bias. This ground-truthing pinpoints uncertainties in BC emission sources, which benefit both climate/air-quality modeling and mitigation policies in South Asia.

A cross-scale assessment of productivity–diversity relationships,"Aim: Biodiversity and ecosystem productivity vary across the globe, and considerable effort has been made to describe their relationships. Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research has traditionally focused on how experimentally controlled species richness affects net primary productivity (S → NPP) at small spatial grains. In contrast, the influence of productivity on richness (NPP → S) has been explored at many grains in naturally assembled communities. Mismatches in spatial scale between approaches have fuelled debate about the strength and direction of biodiversity–productivity relationships. Here, we examine the direction and strength of the influence of productivity on diversity (NPP → S) and the influence of diversity on productivity (S → NPP) and how these vary across spatial grains. Location: Contiguous USA. Time period: 1999–2015. Major taxa studied: Woody species (angiosperms and gymnosperms). Methods: Using data from North American forests at grains from local (672 m2) to coarse spatial units (median area = 35,677 km2), we assess relationships between diversity and productivity using structural equation and random forest models, while accounting for variation in climate, environmental heterogeneity, management and forest age. Results: We show that relationships between S and NPP strengthen with spatial grain. Within each grain, S → NPP and NPP → S have similar magnitudes, meaning that processes underlying S → NPP and NPP → S either operate simultaneously or that one of them is real and the other is an artefact. At all spatial grains, S was one of the weakest predictors of forest productivity, which was largely driven by biomass, temperature and forest management and age. Main conclusions: We conclude that spatial grain mediates relationships between biodiversity and productivity in real-world ecosystems and that results supporting predictions from each approach (NPP → S and S → NPP) serve as an impetus for future studies testing underlying mechanisms. Productivity–diversity relationships emerge at multiple spatial grains, which should widen the focus of national and global policy and research to larger spatial grains. © 2020 The Authors.

Assessment of contribution of agricultural residue burning on air quality of Delhi using remote sensing and modelling tools,"Application of remote sensing in analysing the pollutant dispersion and concentration in the atmosphere has gained importance over the years amongst the researchers. Particulates, being a threat to human health is being closely monitored for its sources and transport, to implement respective mitigative measures. A study has been carried out to assess the contribution of agriculture residue/stubble burning (SB) in Haryana, Punjab region over the air quality of Delhi region. Monitoring is carried out using multidisciplinary approaches over the region during October and November 2017. A higher baseline value in Delhi is observed throughout the study duration. Both remote sensing and ground data from stations show similar characteristics. Local meteorological condition of study region, observed during the study duration, indicates that particulates from Punjab-Haryana region are not likely to be transmitted over Delhi region. The study performed using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) shows some carbonaceous aerosol subtype over Delhi region. Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) study shows that northwesterly winds intersect the agricultural residue burning regions, which might have transported the burnt stubble particulates towards Delhi area during the days of November 2017. Further, the larger mass of stubble burning aerosols are found to be dispersed at a height 3000 m above the ground, which is out of the human vicinity. The month of October 2017 showed aerosol subtypes majorly from local emissions and dust. Delhi faces severe air pollution issues around human vicinity due to poor meteorological conditions and majorly because of local emission. The severe conditions, however, are generally short-lived and gradually ameliorates with improved meteorological conditions of the region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Application of aerosol classification methods based on AERONET version 3 product over eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea,"Aerosols released into the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources and natural events affect human health, reduce visibility, and alter Earth's radiation budget. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a quantitative estimate of the amount of aerosol present in the atmosphere, and it can be used as a proxy for surface particulate matters. The AERONET is a network of ground-based sun photometers, providing globally AOD data. Long-term ground-based measurements from all point AERONET V3 Level 2.0 data at 10 sites in the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea region covering the countries of Turkey, Romania, Greece, Ukraine and Cyprus were used to determine spatial and temporal distribution of the selected aerosol parameters such as AOD at 440, 500, 870 nm (AOD440, AOD500, AOD870), Angstrom Exponent at 440–870 nm (AE440-870) and fine mode fraction at 500 nm (FMF500) for the period of 1999–2018. Since the combination of AOD, AE440-870 and FMF500 enables categorization of aerosol types, two different classification methods were compared in the region. The first method (M1) divides the aerosols into three categories (marine, desert dust and continental) using the parameters of AOD500 and FMF500 whereas the second method (M2) has five categorizations (marine, continental, biomass burning, desert dust, and mixed-type) using the parameters of AOD440 and AE440-870. The multiyear averaged AOD and AE spatiotemporal variability over the region was also presented at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.625° based on MERRA-2 reanalysis data. The results indicate that marine aerosol was the most predominant type in both methods while continental aerosol type was also obtained at a high rate over the region. The highest AOD occurred in summer, while lowest values were observed in winter. A high volume of fine-mode particles was observed during summer with higher AE values caused by carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning mainly observed at north-western part of the region. In contrast with that, coarse-mode particles, mainly dust, dominated with lower AE values during spring over the southern and eastern parts of the region. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",,No,No,No
Peat-forest burning smoke in Maritime Continent: Impacts on receptor PM2.5 and implications at emission sources,"This study characterizes the impacts of transported peat-forest (PF) burning smoke on an urban environment and evaluates associated source burning conditions based on carbon properties of PM2.5 at the receptor site. We developed and validated a three-step classification that enables systematic and more rapid identification of PF smoke impacts on a tropical urban environment with diverse emissions and complex atmospheric processes. This approach was used to characterize over 300 daily PM2.5 data collected during 2011–2013, 2015 and 2019 in Singapore. A levoglucosan concentration of ≥0.1 μg/m3 criterion indicates dominant impacts of transported PF smoke on urban fine aerosols. This approach can be used in other ambient environments for practical and location-dependent applications. Organic carbon (OC) concentrations (as OC indicator) can be an alternate to levoglucosan for assessing smoke impacts on urban environments. Applying the OC concentration indicator identifies smoke impacts on ∼80% of daily samples in 2019 and shows an accuracy of 51–86% for hourly evaluation. Following the systematic identification of urban PM2.5 predominantly affected by PF smoke in 2011–2013, 2015 and 2019, we assessed the concentration ratio of char-EC/soot-EC as an indicator of smoldering- or flaming-dominated burning emissions. When under the influence of transported PF smoke, the mean concentration ratio of char-EC to soot-EC in urban PM2.5 decreased by >70% from 8.2 in 2011 to 2.3 in 2015 but increased to 3.8 in 2019 (p < 0.05). The reversed trend with a 65% increase from 2015 to 2019 shows stronger smoldering relative to flaming, indicating a higher level of soil moisture at smoke origins, possibly associated with rewetting and revegetating peatlands since 2016.• Approaches are developed to timely (hourly) identify impacts of transported biomass burning smoke on urban PM2.5. • Chemical features of smoke-affected PM2.5 at receptor sites can infer dominant burning conditions at smoke origins. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Aerosol optical properties and its type classification based on multiyear joint observation campaign in north China plain megalopolis,"Since haze and other air pollution are frequently seen in the North China Plain (NCP), detail information on aerosol optical and radiative properties and its type classification is demanded for the study of regional environmental pollution. Here, a multiyear ground-based synchronous sun photometer observation at seven sites on North China Plain megalopolis from 2013 to 2018 was conducted. First, the annual and seasonal variation of these characteristics as well as the intercomparsion were analyzed. Then the potential relationships between these properties with meteorological factors and the aerosol type classification were discussed. The results show: Particle volume exhibited a decreasing trend from the urban downtown to suburban and the rural region. The annual average aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD440) varied from ∼0.43 to 0.86 over the NCP. Annual average single-scattering albedo at 440 nm (SSA440) varied from ∼0.89 to 0.93, indicating a moderate to slight absorption capacity. Average absorption aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AAOD440) varied from ∼0.07 to 0.10. The absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) (∼0.89–1.40) indicated the multi-types of absorptive matters originated form nature and anthropogenic emission. The discussion of aerosol composition showed a smaller particle size of aerosol from biomass burning and/or fossil foil consumption with enhanced aerosol scattering and enlarged light extinction. Aerosol classification indicated a large percentage of mixed absorbing aerosol (∼20%–49%), which showed increasing trend between relative humidity (RH) with aerosol scattering and dust was an important environmental pollutant compared to southern China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Land covers analyses during slash and burn agriculture by using multispectral imagery obtained with Unattended Aerial Vehicles (UAVs); [Análisis de la cobertura vegetal durante la agricultura de tumba-quema utilizando imágenes multispectrales obtenidas con Vehículos Aéreos no Tripulados (VANTs)],"Background. The Milpa is one of the traditional agricultural systems of Yucatan, Mexico; it is implemented by using the agricultural procedure called “Slash & Burn”. Quality and quantity of forest fuel (i.e. biomass) are two of the main factors related to burn severity. Burning affects soil properties related to fertility and crop production. The use of new approaches of remote sensing technologies such as Unattended Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), can allow studying the importance of fire in agriculture to improve productivity in slash & burn agricultural systems. Objective. Analyze the land covers and its influence on the severity of the agricultural burning in a ""Milpa"" agroecosystem with multi-spectral images acquired by UAVs. Methodology. The study site was located in the municipality of Tzucacab, Yucatan, Mexico. Two plots were selected [10-15 and 20-25 years of fallow]; land cover was characterized before and after slash & burn. Three multispectral sensors [Red, Green, Blue (RGB); Near Infrared (NIR) and; Thermal Infra-Red (TIR)] were mounted on UAVs, to obtained multispectral imagery and generate orthomosaics for later analyses. Results. With the imagery, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI] was calculated and its spectral behavior evaluated. The imagery was used to analyze the fire intensity. On RGB imagery, patterns of areas with greater dry biomass cover associated to high burn severity and, areas with green vegetation or naked soil associated to low burn severity were observed. Land covers with high fuel potential showed low NDVI index values. Implications. The analyses of the multispectral imagery taken by drones allow the quick evaluation of the land covers and the intensity of agricultural fires, with the pertinent adjustments, in the near future this could become a standard methodology to accomplish this kind of evaluations. Conclusions. This approach allowed to analyze the state of land covers to visually assess the quality of fuel and its influence on the intensity of an agricultural fire. The RGB and NIR imagery obtained by UAVs can be a good tool to predict the intensity of an agricultural fire, TIR imagery could be used to find mathematical relations between land covers and fire intensity. © 2021 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

Improved algorithms for remote sensing-based aerosol retrieval during extreme biomass burning events,"This study proposed an aerosol characterization process using satellites for severe biomass burning events. In general, these severely hazy cases are labeled as “undecided” or “hazy.” Because atmospheric aerosols are significantly affected by factors such as air quality, global climate change, local environmental risk, and human and biological health, efficient and accurate algorithms for aerosol retrieval are required for global satellite data processing. Our previous classification of aerosol types was based primarily on near-ultraviolet (UV) data, which facilitated subsequent aerosol retrieval. In this study, algorithms for aerosol classification were expanded to events with serious biomass burning aerosols (SBBAs). Once a biomass burning event is identified, the appropriate radiation simulation method can be applied to characterize the SBBAs. The second-generation global imager (SGLI) on board the Japanese mission JAXA/Global Change Observation Mission-Climate contains 19 channels, including red (674 nm) and near-infrared (869 nm) polarization channels with a high resolution of 1 km. Using the large-scale wildfires in Kalimantan, Indonesia in 2019 as an example, the complementarity between the polarization information and the nonpolarized radiance measurements from the SGLI was demonstrated to be effective in radiation simulations for biomass burning aerosol retrieval. The retrieved results were verified using NASA/AERONET ground-based measurements, and then compared against JAXA/SGLI/L2-version-1 products, and JMA/Himawari-8/AHI observations. © MDPI AG.

"First surface measurement of variation of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) concentration over the Pristine Himalayan region of Garhwal, Uttarakhand, India","A Droplet Measurement Technology (DMT) Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter (CCNC) was deployed to measure cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) for the first time in the pristine Himalayan region at Himalayan Clouds Observatory (HCO), Swami Ram Tirtha (SRT) Campus (30°34′ N, 78°41′ E, 1706 m AMSL), Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna (HNB) Garhwal University, Badshahithaul, Tehri Garhwal, Uttarakhand, India. The CCN concentration (NCCN) was observed at four supersaturation levels (SS: 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0%). In this study, we reported CCN concentration at 0.5% SS in different weather conditions from Aug 01, 2018 to Jun 30, 2019. During this observation period, the monthly averaged value of CCN concentration ranged between 1098.3 ± 448.9 cm−3 (mean ± SD) and 3842.9 ± 2512.9 cm−3. It covers a significantly wide range of daily averaged concentrations from the minimum concentration of 43.84 cm−3 (during heavy wet scavenging due to snowfall) to maximum concentration of 17000 cm−3 (during the events of a forest fire) at the observation site. The highest CCN concentration is observed at the time of sunrise (~07:00 a.m.) and after the sunset (~07:00 p.m.) for the diurnal variation of monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter season. Pre-monsoon season shows peak values at 10:00 a.m. and at 07:00 p.m. with higher concentrations at night hours. The possible reasons for maximum concentration in morning and evening time could be upliftment and settlement of CCN because of the convection process, anthropogenic emission, vehicular emission, and biomass burning in the residential area and valley region adjacent to HCO, Badshahithaul. The highest CCN concentration (3842.9 ± 2513 cm−3) values of the whole observation period were observed in May 2019. It was significantly affected by the heavy fire activities over the Uttarakhand and nearby IGP regions. Diurnal variation of CCN concentration during the HFAD shows higher values in the night time differing from the diurnal pattern of CCN for other months of the observation period. The long-range transport of air mass could also contribute to the high CCN concentration values, as found through the five-day air mass backward trajectory analysis. The lowest value of CCN concentration corresponds to the heavy rains and snowfall days, possibly caused by extensive wet scavenging. Cluster analysis of the air mass trajectories used for the allocation and classification of the possible sources of pollutants reaching the observation site. The highest fraction of CCN concentration (more than 2000 cm−3) corresponds to the air mass from the arid and semi-arid regions of Asian countries. Large air mass fraction (~40–60%) with moderate CCN concentration was received from northwestern IGP region and foothills of central Himalaya. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Carbonaceous aerosol composition in air masses influenced by large-scale biomass burning: A case study in northwestern Vietnam,"We investigated concentrations of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and a wide range of particlebound organic compounds in daily sampled PM2:5 at the remote Pha Din (PDI) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) monitoring station in northwestern Vietnam during an intense 3-week sampling campaign from 23 March to 12 April 2015. The site is known to receive trans-regional air masses during large-scale biomass burning (BB) episodes. BB is a globally widespread phenomenon and BB emission characterization is of high scientific and societal relevance. Emissions composition is influenced by multiple factors (e.g., fuel and thereby vegetation type, fuel moisture, fire temperature, available oxygen). Due to regional variations in these parameters, studies in different world regions are needed. OC composition provides valuable information regarding the healthand climate-relevant properties of PM2.5 Yet, OC composition studies from PDI are missing in the scientific literature to date. Therefore, we quantified 51 organic compounds simultaneously by in situ derivatization thermal desorption gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IDTD-GC-TOFMS). Anhydrosugars, methoxyphenols, nalkanes, fatty acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrophenols, and OC were used in a hierarchical cluster analysis highlighting distinctive patterns for periods under low, medium, and high BB influence. The highest particle phase concentration of the typical primary organic aerosol (POA) and possible secondary organic aerosol (SOA) constituents, especially nitrophenols, were found on 5 and 6 April. We linked the trace gas mixing ratios of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) to the statistical classification of BB events based on OA composition and found increased CO and O3 levels during medium and high BB influence. Likewise, a backward trajectory analysis indicates different source regions for the identified periods based on the OA clusters, with cleaner air masses arriving from the northeast, i.e., mainland China and the Yellow Sea. The more polluted periods are characterized by trajectories from the southwest, with more continental recirculation of the medium cluster and more westerly advection for the high cluster. These findings highlight that BB activities in northern Southeast Asia significantly enhance the regional organic aerosol loading and also affect the carbonaceous PM2.5 constituents and the trace gases in northwestern Vietnam. The presented analysis adds valuable data on the carbonaceous and chemical composition of PM2.5, in particular of OC, in a region of scarce data availability, and thus offers a reference dataset from Southeast Asian large-scale BB for future studies. Such a reference dataset may be useful for the evaluation of atmospheric transport simulation models, or for comparison with other world regions and BB types, such as Australian bush fires, African savannah fires, or tropical peatland fires.  © 2021 Dac-Loc Nguyen et al.",,No,No,No
Particulate Matter Monitoring and Assessment through Internet of Things: a Health Information System for Enhanced Living Environments,"People spend most of their time inside buildings. Therefore, indoor air quality monitoring contributes to improve health and well-being. Several studies focus on the critical impact of particulate matter on residential air quality. In 2016, particulate matter caused 412 thousand premature deaths in 41 European countries. This paper presents the development of an affordable health information system for enhanced living environments. The authors propose a cost-effective, modular, scalable, and easy installation solution for particulate matter monitoring. The system is connected to ThingSpeak. It can be installed in any type of building. It requires only a power source and a Wi-Fi network with internet access. The main contribution of this paper is to present the detailed architecture and testing results. The particulate matter monitoring system was installed for one week in a domestic kitchen with an open fireplace. The results showed impact of the biomass burning on indoor air quality. The mean values per day ranged from: 10.53 to 50.62 μg/m3 for PM1.0, 15.35 to 69.37 μg/m3 for PM2.5, and 20.1 to 90.69 μg/m3 for PM10. The maximum values per hour were registered at 13:00: 72.14 μg/m3 for PM1.0, 99.70 μg/m3 for PM2.5, and 132.13 μg/m3 for PM10. Cost-effective sensors do not have the accuracy level of industrial equipment. Therefore, they should not be used for numerical and in-depth accurate characterization of the environment. Nevertheless, continuous particulate matter monitoring provides consistent data series for analysis of indoor air quality evolution. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,No,No,No
Aerosol characteristics at the Southern Great Plains site during the HI-SCALE campaign,"Large uncertainties exist in global climate model predictions of radiative forcing due to insufficient understanding and simplified numerical representation of cloud formation and cloud-aerosol interactions. The Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols and Land Ecosystems (HI-SCALE) campaign was conducted near the DOE's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in north-central Oklahoma to provide a better understanding of land-atmosphere interactions, aerosol and cloud properties, and the influence of aerosol and land- atmosphere interactions on cloud formation. The HI-SCALE campaign consisted of two intensive observational periods (IOPs) (April-May and August-September, 2016), during which coincident measurements were conducted both on the G-1 aircraft platform and at the SGP ground site. In this study we focus on the observations at the SGP ground site. An Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and an Ionicon protontransfer- reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) were deployed, characterizing chemistry of non-refractory aerosol and trace gases, respectively. Contributions from various aerosol sources, including biogenic and biomass burning emissions, were retrieved using factor analysis of the AMS data. In general, the organic aerosols at the SGP site was highly oxidized, with oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA) identified as the dominant factor for both the spring and summer IOP though more aged in spring. Cases of isopreneepoxydiol- derived secondary organic aerosol (IEPOX SOA) and biomass burning events were further investigated to understand additional sources of organic aerosol. Unlike other regions largely impacted by IEPOX chemistry, the IEPOX SOA at SGP was more highly oxygenated, likely due to the relatively weak local emissions of isoprene. Biogenic emissions appear to largely control the formation of organic aerosol (OA) during the HI-SCALE campaign. Potential HOM (highly oxygenated molecule) chemistry likely contributes to the highly oxygenated feature of aerosols at the SGP site, with impacts on new particle formation and global climate. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Evaluating the impacts of burning biomass on PM2.5 regional transport under various emission conditions,"The fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emitted by burning biomass has become the main source of pollution in cities; this pollution seriously threatens the ecosystem and inhabitants' health. A major challenge in dealing with this issue is the uncertainty regarding the influence of burning biomass on PM2.5 regional transport. In this study, Harbin-Changchun Megalopolis is the research area. Using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model combined with satellite data and PM2.5 monitoring data, we quantitatively analyzed the regional transport of PM2.5 from burning biomass upwind of each city under different emission conditions. Conditions at burn sites, especially emission intensity and meteorological factors, as well as transport distance play significant roles in the regional transport of PM2.5. Higher emission intensity aggravated the concentration of downwind PM2.5, at most 19.7 μg ⋅ m−3. Shorter transport distance strengthened the impact of biomass burning on downstream PM2.5 by weakening elimination, which could be up to 96.8 μg ⋅ m−3. Moreover, meteorological factors at fire points were closely related to the transport of PM2.5. First, lower planetary boundary layer height could enhance the transport of PM2.5 from the burning biomass by inhibiting vertical diffusion, and the enhancement could be up to 46.1 μg ⋅ m−3. Second, compared to strong wind, light wind caused the weaker dilution, enhancing PM2.5 regional transport by as much as 32.5 μg ⋅ m−3. Third, relatively humidity at 30%-40% had the strongest effect in facilitating the transport of PM2.5 from burning biomass. We conclude that comprehensively considering these three factors, namely the emission intensity, transport distance and meteorological factors at burn sites can facilitate the cross-regional development of accurate prediction models and effective pollution control measures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,No,No,No
Spatially Resolved Photochemistry Impacts Emissions Estimates in Fresh Wildfire Plumes,"Wildfire emissions affect downwind air quality and human health. Predictions of these impacts using models are limited by uncertainties in emissions and chemical evolution of smoke plumes. Using high-time-resolution aircraft measurements, we illustrate spatial variations that can exist within a plume due to differences in the photochemical environment. Horizontal and vertical crosswind gradients of dilution-corrected mixing ratios were observed in midday plumes for reactive compounds and their oxidation products, such as nitrous acid, catechol, and ozone, likely due to faster photochemistry in optically thinner plume edges relative to darker plume cores. Gradients in plumes emitted close to sunset are characterized by titration of O3 in the plume and reduced or no gradient formation. We show how crosswind gradients can lead to underestimated emission ratios for reactive compounds and overestimated emission ratios for oxidation products. These observations will lead to improved predictions of wildfire emissions, evolution, and impacts across daytime and nighttime. © 2021. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",,No,No,No
The influence of south east Asia forest fires on ambient particulate matter concentrations in Singapore: An ecological study using random forest and vector autoregressive models,"Haze, due to biomass burning, is a recurring problem in Southeast Asia (SEA). Exposure to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) remains an important public health concern. In this paper, we examined the long-term seasonality of PM2.5 and PM10 in Singapore. To study the association between forest fires in SEA and air quality in Singapore, we built two machine learning models, including the random forest (RF) model and the vector autoregressive (VAR) model, using a benchmark air quality dataset containing daily PM2.5 and PM10 from 2009 to 2018. Furthermore, we incorporated weather parameters as independent variables. We observed two annual peaks, one in the middle of the year and one at the end of the year for both PM2.5 and PM10. Singapore was more affected by fires from Kalimantan compared to fires from other SEA countries. VAR models performed better than RF with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values being 0.8% and 6.1% lower for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The situation in Singapore can be reasonably anticipated with predictive models that incorporate information on forest fires and weather variations. Public communication of anticipated air quality at the national level benefits those at higher risk of experiencing poorer health due to poorer air quality. © 2020 by the authors.

Lignin's ability to nucleate ice via immersion freezing and its stability towards physicochemical treatments and atmospheric processing,"Aerosol-cloud interactions dominate the uncertainties in current predictions of the atmosphere's radiative balance. Specifically, the ice phase remains difficult to predict in mixed-phase clouds, where liquid water and ice co-exist. The formation of ice in these clouds originates from heterogeneous ice nucleation processes, of which immersion freezing is a dominant pathway. Among atmospheric surfaces capable of forming a template for ice, mineral dust, biological material and more recently organic matter are known to initiate freezing. To further our understanding of the role of organic matter in ice nucleation, we chose to investigate the ice nucleation (IN) ability of a specific subcomponent of atmospheric organic matter, the biopolymer lignin. Ice nucleation experiments were conducted in our custom-built freezing ice nuclei counter (FINC) to measure freezing temperatures in the immersion freezing mode. We find that lignin acts as an ice-active macromolecule at temperatures relevant for mixed-phase cloud processes (e.g. 50 activated fraction up to -18.8° at 200mgCL-2). Within a dilution series of lignin solutions, we observed a non-linear effect in freezing temperatures; the number of IN sites per milligram of carbon increased with decreasing lignin concentration. We attribute this change to a concentration-dependant aggregation of lignin in solution. We further investigated the effect of physicochemical treatments on lignin's IN activity, including experiments with sonication, heating and reaction with hydrogen peroxide. Only harsh conditions such as heating to 260°C and addition of a mixture with a ratio of 1:750 of grams of lignin to millilitres of hydrogen peroxide were able to decrease lignin's IN activity to the instrument's background level. Next, photochemical and ozone bubbling experiments were conducted to test the effect of atmospheric processing on lignin's IN activity. We showed that this activity was not susceptible to changes under atmospherically relevant conditions, despite chemical changes observed by UV-Vis absorbance. Our results present lignin as a recalcitrant IN-active subcomponent of organic matter within, for example, biomass burning aerosols and brown carbon. They further contribute to the understanding of how soluble organic material in the atmosphere can nucleate ice.  © Author(s) 2020.",,No,No,No
Chemical Characterization of Emissions Arising from Solid Fuel Combustion - Contrasting Wood and Cow Dung Burning,"Biomass burning is a dominant source of ultrafine particulate matter in the atmosphere. Particulate matter is a leading health risk factor on a global scale, causing millions of premature deaths annually. Biomass burning also emits short-term climate forcers which contribute to the warming of the Earth's atmosphere. Wood and animal dung are widely employed in the developing world as the primary sources of household energy. While wood burning is well studied, emissions from dung remain largely uncharacterized. Emissions from a given burn are highly complex chemical mixtures. While specific biomass tracers - such as levoglucosan - are employed to track burns, a fundamental chemical understanding of biomass emissions is required to predict their impacts. Herein, we conducted comprehensive sets of chemical analyses for particles emitted from biomass burning. Samples were generated using a tube furnace allowing reproducible, precise control of conditions. Emission factor data for levoglucosan and its isomers were measured from extracted particulate matter. We found that the levoglucosan emission factors from two distinct types of cow dung were consistently lower than that from wood. The water-extractable fraction of dung emissions exhibited light-absorptive properties greater than wood. Nontargeted chemical characterization was achieved through deconvolution of high-resolution mass spectrometry data. Overall, we present that the key differences between wood and dung emissions mirror the differences in their fuel compositions. The complexity of the extracted spectra and the unique characteristics of dung emissions accentuate the need for further study on biomass types less common within the Western context.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,No,No,No
Spatiotemporal distribution of the Aura-OMI aerosol index and dust storm case studies over Iraq,"Aerosol index (AI) is qualitatively indicating the presence of suspended aerosol particles in the air. The major sources of these particles are desert dust, biomass burning, and volcanic ash plumes. The AI observations derived from the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) on Aura satellite were analyzed over Iraq for the period 2005–2018. The results showed that the long-term spatiotemporal distribution of AI was significantly variable, with lower values (< 1.5) at the north mountain area and western highland and higher at the central and southern parts of the country. Two distinct spots of very high AI were observed over the two major source areas of dust storms, in the northwest and south of Iraq. In general, AI was increasing from northwest to south and southeast suggesting that the main source of the aerosols is regionally not locally and coming from west and northwest side. The results also indicated that AI has an annual cycle over the entire country: minimum in winter (< 0.5 during January in the northeast) and maximum in summer (~ 4.0 during June in the south). The analysis of monthly AI revealed that maximum monthly AI (= 4.1) occurred in the northwestern town of Anah and the minimum AI (~ 0) happened in the northern city of Mosul. Statistical test of AI seasonal time series exhibited a significant decreasing trend in AI in the central and southern parts of the country. Analysis of daily AI showed that annual number of days with AI > 2 may reach more than 140 days in Basra and more than 90 in Anah and Baghdad. Comparisons of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) true color images and AI for five different types of dust storms occurred over Iraq showed that AI is maximum at the core of the storm and the gradation of decreasing AI was consistent with the spread of dust out of the core. Maximum AI was > 5.5 during summer Shamal storm, > 3.0 during winter Shamal and frontal cases, and > 2.0 for the Haboob case. The HYSPLIT trajectories calculations showed that the dust plume in the MODIS image was significantly similar to the computed trajectories and the majority of air masses were coming from north and northwest. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",,No,No,No
Exploring the Constraints on Simulated Aerosol Sources and Transport Across the North Atlantic With Island-Based Sun Photometers,"Atmospheric aerosol over the North Atlantic Ocean impacts regional clouds and climate. In this work, we use a set of sun photometer observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) located on the Graciosa and Cape Verde islands, along with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to investigate the sources of these aerosol and their transport over the North Atlantic Ocean. At both locations, the largest simulated contributor to aerosol extinction is the local source of sea-salt aerosol. In addition to this large source, we find that signatures consistent with long-range transport of anthropogenic, biomass burning, and dust emissions are apparent throughout the year at both locations. Model simulations suggest that this signal of long-range transport in AOD is more apparent at higher elevation locations; the influence of anthropogenic and biomass burning aerosol extinction is particularly pronounced at the height of Pico Mountain, near the Graciosa Island site. Using a machine learning approach, we further show that simulated observations at these three sites (near Graciosa, Pico Mountain, and Cape Verde) can be used to predict the simulated background aerosol imported into cities on the European mainland, particularly during the local winter months, highlighting the utility of background AOD monitoring for understanding downwind air quality. ©2020.

A fuzzy machine learning approach for identification of paddy stubble burnt fields,"Stubble burning is the most common practice in Northern region of India and is considered as the main reason for pollution in nearby NCR (National Capital Region) New Delhi, India. Therefore, in this research work, paddy stubble burnt fields were identified by using fuzzy based machine learning algorithms for a test site in Patiala, Punjab, India. An Euclidean Distance (ED) and Gaussian Kernel based Modified Possibilistic c-Means (MPCM) algorithms were used for this purpose. The main objective of this research work was to test the effectiveness of machine learning approach for identification of paddy stubble burnt filed and also to find out the better classifier amongst Euclidean Distance (ED) and Gaussian Kernel MPCM classifier. The Sentinel 2A/2B cloud free temporal data having a high frequency of repetitiveness in the interval of 5-days were used. To reduce spectral dimensionality of data Class Based Sensor Independent Indices (CBSII) database were generated. The burning was mainly observed from the last week of October to the first week of November and has been visualized using variation of CBSII-NDVI temporal plot. Normalized Burnt Ratio (NBR) was computed and compared with CBSII-NDVI outputs for both the ED and Kernel based MPCM classifiers. Delta Normalized Burnt Ratio (ΔNBR) was computed for cross-validation of burnt patches and is found to be in between 0.45 and 0.66. Thus, it can be concluded that kernel based MPCM classifiers are more efficient in terms of accuracy and robustness to noise in comparison to distance based MPCM classifiers, for the mapping of paddy burnt fields. © 2020, Korean Spatial Information Society.",,No,No,No
Evaluation methods for low-cost particulate matter sensors,"Understanding and improving the quality of data generated from low-cost sensors represent a crucial step in using these sensors to fill gaps in air quality measurement and understanding. This paper shows results from a 10-month-long campaign that included side-by-side measurements and comparison between reference instruments approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and low-cost particulate matter sensors in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. At this rural site in the Midwestern United States the instruments typically encountered only low (under 20 μg m-3) concentrations of particulate matter; however, higher concentrations (50-400 μg m-3) were observed on 3 different days during what were likely agricultural burning events. This study focused on methods for understanding and improving data quality for low-cost particulate matter sensors. The data offered insights on how averaging time, choice of reference instrument, and the observation of higher pollutant concentrations can all impact performance indicators (R2 and root mean square error) for an evaluation. The influence of these factors should be considered when comparing one sensor to another or when determining whether a sensor can produce data that fit a specific need. Though R2 and root mean square error remain the dominant metrics in sensor evaluations, an alternative approach using a prediction interval may offer more consistency between evaluations and a more direct interpretation of sensor data following an evaluation. Ongoing quality assurance for sensor data is needed to ensure that data continue to meet expectations. Observations of trends in linear regression parameters and sensor bias were used to analyze calibration and other quality assurance techniques.  © 2021 Jeffrey K. Bean.",,No,No,No
"Comparison of spatial modelling approaches on PM10 and No2 concentration variations: A case study in Surabaya city, Indonesia","Because of fast-paced industrialization, urbanization, and population growth in Indonesia, there are serious health issues in the country resulting from air pollution. This study uses geospatial modelling technologies, namely land-use regression (LUR), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographic and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) models, to assess variations in particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in Surabaya City, Indonesia. This is the first study to implement spatiotemporal variability of air pollution concentrations in Surabaya City, Indonesia. To develop the prediction models, air pollution data collected from seven monitoring stations from 2010 to 2018 were used as dependent variables, while land-use/land cover allocations within a 250 m to 5000 m circular buffer range surrounding the monitoring stations were collected as independent variables. A supervised stepwise variable selection procedure was applied to identify the important predictor variables for developing the LUR, GWR, and GTWR models. The developed models of LUR, GWR, and GTWR accounted for 49%, 50%, and 51% of PM10 variations and 46%, 47%, and 48% of NO2 variations, respectively. The GTWR model performed better (R2 = 0.51 for PM10 and 0.48 for NO2) than the other two models (R2 = 0.49–0.50 for PM10 and 0.46–0.47 for NO2), LUR and GWR. In the PM10 model four predictor variables, public facility, industry and warehousing, paddy field, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were selected during the variable selection procedure. Meanwhile, paddy field, residential area, rainfall, and temperature played important roles in explaining NO2 variations. Because of biomass burning issues in South Asia, the paddy field, which has a positive correlation with PM10 and NO2, was selected as a predictor. By using long-term monitoring data to establish prediction models, this model may better depict PM10 and NO2 concentration variations within areas across Asia. © 2020 by the authors.

Impacts of oxidizer concentration and fuel composition on near-source aerosol emissions from lignocellulosic biomass and constituent burning,"Biomass burning (BB), a multi-step process including drying, devolatilization, and oxidation of volatiles and char, is a globally occurring phenomenon that is understood to produce significant quantities of aerosols that have a broad range of local and global effects on humans and the environment. Quantities and properties of BB-derived aerosols are difficult to predict due to the complex nature of BB. Near-source conditions, such as oxygen availability and fuel composition, have been identified as influential factors in the properties of aerosol emissions. This work examined the total and size-resolved number and mass aerosol emission factors from dry, pulverized lignocellulosic biomass and its major constituents under laboratory burning conditions to understand the influence of oxygen level and fuel composition on near-source aerosol production. Lignocellulosic biomass and major constituents, including hemicellulose (xylan), cellulose and lignin, were pyrolyzed and combusted in inert and oxidative environments at varying oxygen levels, and the aerosol particle emissions were characterized in terms of size and quantity at a fixed dilution temperature. Fuel mass and fuel heating rate were varied to assess the sensitivity of results to these factors. A previously developed summative model to predict near-source BB aerosol emissions was also tested. Results showed that the total number and mass aerosol emissions decreased with increased oxygen levels. Nucleation mode particles dominated the number emissions in both inert and oxidative environments, but larger aerosol sizes were observed in the oxidative environment. Aerosol particle coagulation and growth were observed at larger fuel masses, indicated by a significant decrease in the total number emission factors in both inert and oxidative environments, while the total mass emission factor only slightly decreased and increased in inert and oxidative environments, respectively. The size of aerosols formed was found to positively correlate with absolute fuel consumption rate, and the effects of oxidation through combustion chemistry and thermal feedback were explored. Good agreement between the simulated and measured number emission factors for pinewood was observed in both the inert and oxidative reaction environments over the range of tested fuel masses. Simulated and measured mass emission factors showed good agreement in the oxidative environment and poorer agreement in the inert environment. Reasons for this discrepancy were explored and the importance of constituent surrogate selection is highlighted. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
New SOA Treatments Within the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM): Strong Production and Sinks Govern Atmospheric SOA Distributions and Radiative Forcing,"Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are large contributors to fine particle mass loading and number concentration and interact with clouds and radiation. Several processes affect the formation, chemical transformation, and removal of SOA in the atmosphere. For computational efficiency, global models use simplified SOA treatments, which often do not capture the dynamics of SOA formation. Here we test more complex SOA treatments within the global Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to investigate how simulated SOA spatial distributions respond to some of the important but uncertain processes affecting SOA formation, removal, and lifetime. We evaluate model predictions with a suite of surface, aircraft, and satellite observations that span the globe and the full troposphere. Simulations indicate that both a strong production (achieved here by multigenerational aging of SOA precursors that includes moderate functionalization) and a strong sink of SOA (especially in the middle upper troposphere, achieved here by adding particle-phase photolysis) are needed to reproduce the vertical distribution of organic aerosol (OA) measured during several aircraft field campaigns; without this sink, the simulated middle upper tropospheric OA is too large. Our results show that variations in SOA chemistry formulations change SOA wet removal lifetime by a factor of 3 due to changes in horizontal and vertical distributions of SOA. In all the SOA chemistry formulations tested here, an efficient chemical sink, that is, particle-phase photolysis, was needed to reproduce the aircraft measurements of OA at high altitudes. Globally, SOA removal rates by photolysis are equal to the wet removal sink, and photolysis decreases SOA lifetimes from 10 to ~3 days. A recent review of multiple field studies found no increase in net OA formation over and downwind biomass burning regions, so we also tested an alternative, empirical SOA treatment that increases primary organic aerosol (POA) emissions near source region and converts POA to SOA with an aging time scale of 1 day. Although this empirical treatment performs surprisingly well in simulating OA loadings near the surface, it overestimates OA loadings in the middle and upper troposphere compared to aircraft measurements, likely due to strong convective transport to high altitudes where wet removal is weak. The default improved model formulation (multigenerational aging with moderate fragmentation and photolysis) performs much better than the empirical treatment in these regions. Differences in SOA treatments greatly affect the SOA direct radiative effect, which ranges from −0.65 (moderate fragmentation and photolysis) to −2 W m−2 (moderate fragmentation without photolysis). Notably, most SOA formulations predict similar global indirect forcing of SOA calculated as the difference in cloud forcing between present-day and preindustrial simulations. © 2020.

Human and climate drivers of global biomass burning variability,"Biomass burning is one of the most critical factors impacting vegetation and atmospheric trends, with important societal implications, particularly when extreme weather conditions occur. Trends and factors of burned area (BA) have been analysed at regional and global scales, but little effort has been dedicated to study the interannual variability. This paper aimed to better understand factors explaining this variation, under the assumption that the more human control of fires the more frequently they occur, as burnings will be less dependent of weather cycles. Interannual variability of BA was estimated from the coefficient of variation of the annual BA (BA_CV) estimated from satellite data at 250 m, covering the period from 2001 to 2018. These data and the explanatory variables were resampled at 0.25-degree resolution for global analysis. Relations between this variable and explanatory factors, including human and climate drivers, were estimated using Random Forest (RF) and generalized additive models (GAM). BA_CV was negatively related to BA_Mean, implying that areas with higher average BA have lower variability as well. Interannual BA variability decreased when maximum temperature (TMAX) and actual and potential evapotranspiration (AET, PET) increased, cropland and livestock density increased and the human development index (HDI) values decreased. GAM models indicated interesting links with AET, PET and precipitation, with negative relation with BA_CV for the lower ranges and positive for the higher ones, the former indicating fuel limitations of fire activity, and the latter climate constrains. For the global RF model, TMAX, AET and HDI were the main drivers of interannual variability. As originally hypothesised, BA_CV was more dependent on human factors (HDI) in those areas with medium to large BA occurrence, particularly in tropical Africa and Central Asia, while climatic factors were more important in boreal regions, but also in the tropical regions of Australia and South America. © 2021 The Authors",,No,No,No
Climatology and classification of aerosols based on optical properties over selected stations in Iraq,"Atmospheric aerosol plays an important role in the earth's radiation budget, air quality and human health. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) data are extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectoradiometer (MODIS) with resolution of 1° × 1°covering seven selected regions in Iraq: Mosul, Sulaimaniyah, Rutba, Baghdad, Nukhayb, Nasiriyah and Basra for the period (2001-2018), in order to earn the detailed knowledge of aerosols behavior and classification for each season. The Results indicates high variability in (AOD) ranging from (0.05-0.9) with highest values occurred during June-April (0.92, 0.90) in Basra and Nukhuyb respectively, whereas the minimum values were observed during October-November (0.051, 0.055) over Sulaimaniyah and Mosul respectively. The AE records exhibit an opposite behavior to AOD, and highest AE values occurred during winter and autumn which indicates dominant fine particles, and lowest values observed during spring and summer due to dominant coarse particles for whole study area except Nukhayb. Appropriate thresholds for AOD and AE have been employed to classify the aerosol type into maritime, dust, urban, desert dust, biomass burning and the residual cases that do not belong to the threshold used are considered as mixture type for all regions. © 2020 Author(s).",,No,No,No
Study of the extent of contribution of regional stubble burning to the air pollution in Delhi-national capital region,"The issue of extreme episodic air pollution events in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR), India, during the month of November has been of concern for the last few years. Recent studies have used satellite observations and transport models, which indicate movement of smoke from stubble burning regions in Punjab and Haryana towards Delhi. Quantification of contribution of these emissions to the air pollution in Delhi, however, remains uncertain. In the present study, a similar attempt was made, and measurements are reported from 16 ground-based continuous air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) in the Delhi-NCR for the years 2016 and 2017. Time series PM2.5 ground measurements were compared with the total Fire Radiative Power (FRP) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites for the airshed for Delhi-NCR. To quantify the smoke contribution from the fire pixels to the Delhi-NCR, the Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System (NAAPS) smoke data were used. NAAPS simulations show that the smoke aerosol contribution to Delhi-NCR from stubble burning was ~5-10 µg/m3 during the pollution episodic days in 2016. NAAPS results along with the PM2.5 measurements at Ludhiana, Punjab, indicate that the stubble burning emissions may contribute 33-66 µg/m3 to the PM2.5 at Delhi depending on wind conditions and emission levels at the source. The predominant aerosols over the study area during the episodic period were verified to be absorbing in nature. Limited meteorological data indicated low temperatures and high relative humidity conditions during the episodic events. © 2019 Air and Waste Management Association. All rights reserved.",,No,No,No
Spatiotemporal variations of fine particulate organic and elemental carbons in Greater Tokyo,"Hourly concentrations of fine particulate OC and EC are monitored for more than one year by optical monitors at three sites in and out of Tokyo, Japan. Distances between the sites are 20 to 50 km. SOC concentrations are estimated from the OC and EC concentrations by an EC tracer method. Site A in an industrial site shows higher EC concentrations than site B in a residential area, but differences between the sites are much reduced for OC. Site C in a rural area, where measurements are available in colder months, shows pronounced seasonal variations with high peaks in October and December and characteristic diurnal variations in OC with the highest in the evening in October, due probably to open field burning. Photochemical formation of SOC is suggested but does not rise up so much OC concentrations in summer, which are quite lower than other seasons. A comparison between relative concentrations of EC among the sites and local emissions amounts indicates missing or considerable underestimation of EC emissions near the rural site C. Time lag correlations suggest transport of OC produced by open field burning around site C to site A. These findings would be useful for improving model performances in OC/EC predictions. © 2019 by Asian Journal of Atmospheric Environment.",,No,No,No
"Distribution, sources and potential health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM2.5 collected during different monsoon seasons and haze episode in Kuala Lumpur","This study aimed to determine the distribution and potential health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM2.5 collected in Kuala Lumpur during different monsoon seasons. The potential sources of PM2.5 were investigated using 16 priority PAHs with additional of biomass tracers namely levoglucosan (LV), mannosan (MN) and galactosan (GL). This study also investigated the cytotoxic potential of the extracted PAHs towards V79-4 cells. A high-volume air sampler (HVS) was used to collect PM2.5 samples for 24 h. PAHs were extracted using dichloromethane (DCM) while biomass tracers were extracted by a mixture of DCM/methanol (3:1) before analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The cytotoxicity of the PAHs extract was determined by assessing the cell viability through the reduction of tetrazolium salts (MTT). The results showed that the total mean ± SD concentrations of PAHs during the southwest (SW) and northeast (NE) monsoons were 2.51 ± 0.93 ng m−3 and 1.37 ± 0.09 ng m−3, respectively. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) using PAH and biomass tracer concentrations suggested four potential sources of PM2.5; gasoline emissions (29.1%), natural gas and coal burning (28.3%), biomass burning (22.3%), and diesel and heavy oil combustion (20.3%). Health risk assessment showed insignificant incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) of 2.40E-07 for 70 years of exposure. MTT assay suggested that PAHs extracts collected during SW monsoon have cytotoxic effect towards V79-4 cell at the concentrations of 25 μg mL−1, 50 μg mL−1, 100 μg mL−1 whereas non-cytotoxic effect was observed on the PAHs sample collected during NE monsoon. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
"Local emissions and regional wildfires influence refractory black carbon observations near palmer station, antarctica","Antarctica is often regarded as the most pristine continent on Earth. However, local human activity can be significant point sources of production of contaminants, as well as light absorbing aerosols, such as black carbon (BC). In May 2015, over the Austral fall season (at the beginning of the accumulation season), surface snow was sampled at eight sites along a 1.7 km transect extending from Palmer Station, Antarctica. Two additional sites were sampled on Biscoe Point 14 km from the station. Snow samples were analyzed for refractory black carbon (rBC) with a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2). rBC concentrations increased with proximity to the Palmer Station 1.2–16.5 μg-rBC/L-H2O (4.7 ± 4.9 μg-rBC/L-H2O) and were higher than other studies of rBC in snow, such as in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica (MDV) and the Clean Air Sector of the South Pole Station (CAS-SP), except on the more remote Biscoe Island, 0.4–1.2 μg-rBC/L-H2O, which had similar background concentrations to the MDV and CAS-SP, 0.3–1.2 (0.6 ± 0.3 μg-rBC/L-H2O) and (0.14–0.80 μg-rBC/L-H2O), respectively. However, concentrations were lower than previous observations at South Pole Station downwind of the generator and long the runway (6.6–7000 μg-rBC/L-H2O). Palmer Station is located on the southwestern coast of Anvers Island which lies off the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula at 64° 46′S, 64° 03′W. Comparison with the Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System (NAAPS) model show that wildfire smoke may have reached this region of the Antarctic continent during the time period of the deposition of this seasonal snow, suggesting the increase in rBC may be a combination of local combustion of fossil fuels and regional wildfires. Although significant increases in rBC concentrations are found within a km of Palmer Station, like the South Pole Station, rBC is limited to a few kms from the station. Additionally, these measurements of rBC, which may be the only BC measurements in snow on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that background levels are similar to other locations on the continent. © 2019 Khan, Klein, Katich and Xian.",,No,No,No
Simulation of fresh and chemically-aged biomass burning organic aerosol,"A three-dimensional chemical transport model, PMCAMx, was used to quantify the contribution of biomass burning organic aerosol (bbOA) to total organic aerosol (OA) concentrations in the continental U.S. Simulations were performed during three seasonally-representative months (April, July, and September 2008). Biomass burning is predicted to contribute 9% of the domain-averaged OA in April, 28% in July and 13% in September. Secondary OA from semivolatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds is the largest contributor to bbOA concentrations for all months simulated, followed by fresh primary OA. PMCAMx bbOA predictions using the Volatility Basis Set were compared to the results of CAMx version 6.10 that assumes that bbOA is nonvolatile and inert. PMCAMx predicts 66%, 113%, and 108% higher average concentration values of bbOA for April, July, and September, respectively. Predicted OA concentrations at biomass-impacted sites were compared to observed values from the STN and IMPROVE networks. The treatment of biomass burning emissions as semivolatile and reactive improved model performance during the spring and summer. During the fall both models overpredicted the OA levels, suggesting that the fire emissions may have been overestimated. In this case the additional SOA produced in PMCAMx resulted in worse performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Long-term spatiotemporal variations of aerosol optical depth over Yellow and Bohai Sea,"                             In this study, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) level-2 Dark Target (DT) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations at 550 nm (AOD                             550                             ) for the highest quality flag assurance (QA = 3) were obtained to analyze spatiotemporal variations of aerosol optical properties over the Yellow and the Bohai Sea from 2002 to 2017. Spectral AOD observations at 470 nm (AOD                             470                             ) and 660 nm (AOD                             660                             ) were obtained to calculate Angstrom Exponent (AE                             470–660                             ) and classify the aerosol types including clean continental (CC), clean maritime (CM) biomass and urban industrial (BUI), dust (D), and mixed (MXD) aerosol types. Results showed a very distinct spatial pattern of AOD distribution over the Bohai Sea which looks suspicious, i.e., high aerosol loadings (AOD > 0.8) throughout the entire time period, whereas relative low AOD distribution was observed over the adjacent land pixels especially in autumn and winter, which suggested that the DT algorithm might be influenced by a large number of sediments located in the Bohai Sea. Significant differences in spatial distributions were found in different seasons in terms of area coverage as a maximum number of pixels were available during autumn, and regional high and low aerosol loadings were observed during autumn and summer, respectively. Trend analysis from 2002 to 2017 showed that AOD was increased up to 0.04 over the Bohai Sea and decreased up to 0.04 over the Yellow Sea, and this trend varies from month to month. Aerosol classification showed significant contributions of BUI and CC over the region, and contributions of CM, DUST, and MXD aerosols over the Yellow Sea were relatively high compared to the Bohai Sea.                          © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,No,No,No
Impact of biomass burning on regional aerosol optical properties: A case study over northern India,"The present study examines the spatial, seasonal and inter annual variation of biomass burning and its impact on regional aerosol optical properties over Northern India using multi-satellite aerosol observations: Active fire points, AOD (550 nm) and AE (550−860 nm) from MODIS retrievals during January 2003–December 2017 and AAOD (388 nm), SSA (388 nm) and AI from OMI UV retrievals during January 2005–December 2017. Results from MODIS active fire count statistics indicate an increase in the number of fire occurrences (average 1477 fires per year) over India in a period of 15 years (2003-2017). The dominant fire seasons are (i) Pre-monsoon (March to May) accounting to more than 45% and (ii) Post-Monsoon having 24% of total annual fires counts. However, the crop residue burning hotspot region located in Punjab and Haryana, constitutes 26% of the total fires in India. At an average, 15456 (77.08%) fire counts were reported during the paddy season, whereas 3296 (16.44%) fire counts during wheat season respectively. The crop residue burning over the northwest IGP (Punjab) significantly affect the aerosol optical properties locally as well in the downwind regions during post-monsoon season i.e., crop residue fires increased by 4% (170 fires per year) with corresponding AOD, AAOD & AI increased by 8%, 9% & 11% respectively. The satellite observation shows large gradient of aerosol parameters from north-west to south-east along the Himalayan foot-hills which indicates the regional transport of smoke aerosols over the region. This is also supported by ground based AOD observations at four locations (Patiala, Delhi, Dehradun and Kanpur) and Black Carbon measurements at two locations (Patiala and Dehradun). The climatological averaged values of ground based AOD550 for Patiala, Delhi, Dehradun and Kanpur are 0.52 ± 0.26, 0.75 ± 0.40, 0.45 ± 0.24 and 0.57 ± 0.29 respectively whereas BC concentrations are 8.43 ± 3.14 μg m−3 & 3.36 ± 1.26 μg m−3 for Patiala & Dehradun respectively. Comparison of MODIS derived AOD agrees well with ground based AODs (overall R = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.14). In addition, CALIPSO shows the maximum amount of biomass burning smoke aerosols present within the atmospheric boundary layer and some cases it extending up to 2–3 km altitudes. The smoke aerosol transport pathways originated from crop residue burning were analyzed using Hysplit forward trajectories. The results reveal that majority of smoke aerosols are transported to eastern IGP, central India and adjacent oceanic regions during post-monsoon season. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Novel aerosol extinction coefficients and lidar ratios over the ocean from CALIPSO-CloudSat: Evaluation and global statistics,"Aerosol extinction coefficients (σa) and lidar ratios (LRs) are retrieved over the ocean from CALIPSO's Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) attenuated backscatter profiles by solving the lidar equation constrained with aerosol optical depths (AODs) derived by applying the Synergized Optical Depth of Aerosols (SODA) algorithm to ocean surface returns measured by CALIOP and CloudSat's Cloud Profiling Radar. σa and LR are retrieved for two independent scenarios that require somewhat different assumptions: (a) a single homogeneous atmospheric layer (1L) for which the LR is constant with height and (b) a vertically homogeneous layer with a constant LR overlying a marine boundary layer with a homogenous LR fixed at 25sr (two-layer method, 2L). These new retrievals differ from the standard CALIPSO version 4.1 (V4) product, as the CALIOP-SODA method does not rely on an aerosol classification scheme to select LR. CALIOP-SODA σa and LR are evaluated using airborne high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) observations over the northwest Atlantic. CALIOP-SODA LR (1L and 2L) positively correlates with its HSRL counterpart (linear correlation coefficient r>0.67), with a negative bias smaller than 17.4% and a good agreement for σa (r≥0.78) with a small negative bias (≤ - 9:2%j). Furthermore, a global comparison of optical depths derived by CALIOP-SODA and CALIPSO V4 reveals substantial discrepancies over regions dominated by dust and smoke (0.24), whereas Aqua's Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and SODA AOD regional differences are within 0.06. Global maps of CALIOP-SODA LR feature high values over littoral zones, consistent with expectations of continental aerosol transport offshore. In addition, seasonal transitions associated with biomass burning from June to October over the southeast Atlantic are well reproduced by CALIOP- SODA LR. © 2019 Author(s).",,No,No,No
"Biomass Burning Plumes in the Vicinity of the California Coast: Airborne Characterization of Physicochemical Properties, Heating Rates, and Spatiotemporal Features","This study characterizes in situ airborne properties associated with biomass burning (BB) plumes in the vicinity of the California coast. Out of 231 total aircraft soundings in July–August 2013 and 2016, 81 were impacted by BB layers. A number of vertical characteristics of BB layers are summarized in this work (altitude, location relative to cloud top height, thickness, number of vertically adjacent layers, interlayer distances) in addition to differences in vertical aerosol concentration profiles due to either surface type (e.g., land or ocean) or time of day. Significant BB layer stratification occurred, especially over ocean versus land, with the majority of layers in the free troposphere and within 100 m of the boundary layer top. Heating rate profiles demonstrated the combined effect of cloud and BB layers and their mutual interactions, with enhanced heating in BB layers with clouds present underneath. Aerosol size distribution data are summarized below and above the boundary layer, with a notable finding being enhanced concentrations of supermicrometer particles in BB conditions. A plume aging case study revealed the dominance of organics in the free troposphere, with secondary production of inorganic and organic species and coagulation as a function of distance from fire source up to 450 km. Rather than higher horizontal and vertical resolution, a new smoke injection height method was the source of improved agreement for the vertical distribution of BB aerosol in the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System model when compared to airborne data. ©2018.

Carbonaceous aerosol emission reduction over Shandong province and the impact of air pollution control as observed from synthetic satellite data,"Aerosol loading and trace gas emissions from agriculture crop residue burning has been one of the main factors leading to the deterioration of air quality especially during the harvest time in China. Here, we evaluate the contribution of atmospheric aerosol loading from biomass burning and its relationship to the air pollution control policy. We focused on Shandong province, China because it has the highest level of agriculture burning pollution in October. Satellite-based data related to biomass burning including aerosol optical depth (AOD) and fire pixel counts from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), carbon monoxide (CO) from Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT), aerosol index (AI) and tropospheric NO2 from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and aerosol layer depths from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). These metrics were synthetically utilized to evaluate spatial and temporal variation of atmospheric aerosols during the agriculture crop residue burning month from 2006 to 2017. Carbonaceous aerosol emission reduction and the impact of the air pollution control policy can be found in the CALIPSO aerosol types and MODIS fire pixel counts data. The AOD, NO2, CO, and AI over three different land covers (cropland, forest and impervious surfaces) were further obtained according to the land cover data set. The results indicated that there was an obvious decrease in all carbonaceous aerosol-related quantities after year 2012 when the local government began to enact and implement strict air pollution control policies, although a period (2–3 years) of transition after the policy implementation time was identified. We also found that CO is stable and low over the cropland versus forest and impervious surfaces; NO2 exhibits a continuously high value in the northern areas of the oil field. The impact of industry activity rather than straw burning should be also considered for NO2 and CO in certain areas. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Variability in Atmospheric Methane From Fossil Fuel and Microbial Sources Over the Last Three Decades,"Atmospheric measurements show an increase in CH4 from the 1980s to 1998 followed by a period of near-zero growth until 2007. However, from 2007, CH4 has increased again. Understanding the variability in CH4 is critical for climate prediction and climate change mitigation. We examine the role of CH4 sources and the dominant CH4 sink, oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH), in atmospheric CH4 variability over the past three decades using observations of CH4, C2H6, and δ13CCH4 in an inversion. From 2006 to 2014, microbial and fossil fuel emissions increased by 36 ± 12 and 15 ± 8 Tg y−1, respectively. Emission increases were partially offset by a decrease in biomass burning of 3 ± 2 Tg y−1 and increase in soil oxidation of 5 ± 6 Tg y−1. A change in the atmospheric sink did not appear to be a significant factor in the recent growth of CH4. ©2018. The Authors.",,No,No,No
"Effects of plant residue management on soil properties, surface runoff, and soil loss under rainfall simulation in a semi-arid region in Iran","A 5-year field study was conducted on the effect of plant residue management on soil erosion, runoff, bulk density, penetration resistance, and organic carbon. There were three treatments: burning residues on field (BR), returning residues unto the soil surface after harvesting (TR), and removing residues from soil surface (RR) (control treatment). At the end of the 5-year treatment, a rainfall simulation at 90 mm h−1 was applied to each plot. After rainfall simulation started, the runoff volume and soil loss amount in samples were collected at four sampling times. The results showed that the runoff volume for BR (from 145.5 ± 12.2 to 190.0 ± 11.8 mL) differed significantly (p ≤ 0.01) from that of RR (from 32.3 ± 5.5 to 67.5 ± 11.1 mL) and TR (from 10.0 ± 0.7 to 16.7 ± 3.3 mL). A significant difference (p ≤ 0.01) was also observed between RR and TR regarding runoff volume and soil loss amount in different sampling times, except for the first sampling time (2–4 min). The runoff volume in BR and TR was 215% higher and 294% lower than that of the control (RR), respectively. As compared to the control (RR), soil loss decreased by 96.5% in TR but increased by 192% in BR. The BR increased soil bulk density and penetration resistance by 4.9% and 12.4%, whereas TR reduced them by 2.1% and 15.8%, respectively, as compared to the control (RR). The results indicated that the highest (0.35) and lowest (0.03) runoff coefficients were obtained for BR and TR treatments, respectively. It is concluded that returning plant residues to soil is the best residue management practice in decreasing soil runoff volume and controlling soil erosion in semi-arid regions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,No,No,No
In-situ monitoring of the transformation of ash upon heating and the prediction of ash fusion behaviour of coal/biomass blends,"In-situ monitoring of the impacts of biomass blending and temperature on the morphology of coal ash was conducted by using a scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) coupled with a heating stage and an ash fusion analyser. It is found that the interactions between ash originated from different parent fuels affected the morphology of the ash samples derived from the blends and promoted the rapid disintegration and melting of the ash particles. This helps reveal the deformation mechanism and the decrease in ash fusion temperatures of the fuel blends. Results showed that slagging propensity was mitigated as a result of blending the coal with the AAEMs-rich biomass, which is illustrated by the ash fusibility index. Subsequently, a new prediction method based on the mineral composition of the coal and biomass was formulated to elucidate the trends observed in fusion temperature of the fuel blends. This method can be used as a tool to guide the selection of biomass to adjust fusion characteristics of fuel blends. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Toward Improving Short-Term Predictions of Fine Particulate Matter Over the United States Via Assimilation of Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth Retrievals,"This study develops a new approach to improve simulations of the particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model via assimilation of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals using the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system. In contrast to previous studies that only consider errors due to transport, our computation of the background error covariance matrix incorporates uncertainties in anthropogenic emissions. To understand the impact of this approach, three experiments (one background and two assimilations) are performed over the contiguous United States (CONUS) from 15 July to 14 August 2014. The background CMAQ experiment significantly underestimates both the MODIS AOD and surface PM2.5 levels. MODIS AOD assimilation pushes both the CMAQ AOD and surface PM2.5 distributions toward the observed distributions, but CMAQ still underestimates the observations. Averaged over CONUS, the two assimilation experiments with and without including the anthropogenic emission uncertainties improve the correlation coefficient between the model and independent observations of PM2.5 by ~67% and ~48%, respectively, and reduces the mean bias by ~38% and ~10%, respectively. The assimilation improves the model performance everywhere over CONUS, except the New York and Wisconsin, where CMAQ overestimates the observed PM2.5 during nighttime after assimilation likely because of overcorrection of aerosol mass concentrations by the AOD assimilation. Future work should incorporate uncertainties in other processes (biomass burning and biogenic emissions, deposition, chemistry, transport, and boundary conditions) to further enhance the value of assimilating spaceborne AOD retrievals. ©2019.

Agriculture Crop Residue Burning and Its Consequences on Respiration Health of School-Going Children,"Crop waste burning in open fields is a matter of concern in relation to health-related complications in humans of all age groups, especially children. An epidemiological study was been done on school children to estimate the decline in their physiological parameters due to crop residue burning activity. A total of 150 children were inspected for 3 years (2013-2016) at 3 different sites in India. During sampling periods, spirometric tests, ambient particulate matter having size ≥10 µg−3 and ≥2.5 µg−3, and other covariates were measured twice in a fortnight. After adjustment of data in multivariate mixed-effect model, prediction and statistical analyses were done. From results obtained, it has been observed that season wise, the level of fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) was higher in rice crop residue burning seasons than in wheat crop residue burning seasons by 87% to 123% than permitted monthly limits. As per dose-response relationship, maximum degradation was observed in forced vital capacity (−7.62%) and peak expiratory flow (−6.23%) parameters from their baseline values due to burning activities. Prediction equations have been purposed to observe the future trends in physiological parameters of children. Based on Tiffeneau index, an unrecoverable effect was seen in lung parameters. Trends were alarming and may cause serious complications in early age of humans. © The Author(s) 2019.",,No,No,No
What caused severe air pollution episode of November 2016 in New Delhi?,"In recent years, South Asia is experiencing severely degraded air quality, with particulate matter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) reaching unprecedented high levels. Here, we investigate a severe air pollution episode (SAPE) witnessed in New Delhi during 1–7 November 2016. This was a very unusual air pollution episode wherein air quality index exceeded >500 and was persistent for about a week encapsulating the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). We demonstrate that a stagnant weather condition was the dominant cause of the SAPE. Mean concentration of PM2.5 in New Delhi before, during, and after the SAPE were 142 μg/m3, 563 μg/m3, and 240 μg/m3, respectively. Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD), ultraviolet-aerosol index (UV-AI) and surface carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations also showed significant enhancements over large locale spatially by about 50–70% during the SAPE. A large and simultaneous increase in UV-AI and CO downwind of a large number of fire hotspots (Punjab and Haryana) is a clear indication of biomass burning aerosols. Analysis of absorption Ångström exponent further substantiates this finding, showing a large fraction of light absorbing carbonaceous-type aerosols. Radiosonde observations clearly showed that stagnant atmospheric conditions led to SAPE in New Delhi by allowing pollution to accumulate and persist in the near-surface environment. As a result new particle formation was suppressed due to very high pre-existing aerosol concentrations during the SAPE. The heating rate induced by light absorbing aerosols into an atmospheric layer during SAPE was also very high (3.1 ± 0.7 K/day). These findings will help in understanding air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate these complex pollution episodes in an anthropogenic future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Aerosol optical properties and contribution to differentiate haze and haze-freeweather in Wuhan city,"Haze is an atmospheric phenomenon in which different types of particulates obscure the sky, and hence affect almost all human activities. Over a couple of recent decades, China has witnessed increasingly worse air quality as well as atmospheric haziness in its cities. There are various haze contributing factors including the rapid industrialization, excessive biomass burning, and an increase in the number of vehicles. This study proposes a methodology based on the aerosols scattering and absorption properties, to predict the likelihood of an episode of hazy days. This case study employs the aerosol optical properties data from integrated nephelometer and aethalometer sensors from December 2009 to September 2014 over Wuhan. The role and contribution of each aerosol optical parameter (e.g., aerosol scattering and absorption coefficients, single scattering albedo, scattering, and absorption Angstrom exponents, backscatter ratio, and asymmetry factor) in distinguishing haze and haze-free conditions has been quantitatively determined based on a machine learning approach. Each aerosol optical parameter was classified independently by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, and the aerosol scattering (85.37%) and absorption (74.53%) coefficients were found to be primary potential indicators. Through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and traditional statistical analysis, the aerosol scattering and absorption coefficients were then verified as important indicators in distinguishing haze and haze-free days. Finally, through a probability density diagram and frequency histogram, we propose a simple quantitative standard to distinguish between haze and haze-free conditions based on the aerosol scattering coefficient and absorption coefficient in Wuhan City. The accuracy of the standard was determined to be 81.49% after testing, which indicates an accurate result. An error in aerosol optical properties may lead to an error in the calculation of aerosol radiative forcing, the earth's energy budget, and climate prediction. Therefore, understanding of the aerosol properties during haze-free and haze-days will help policymakers to make new policies to control urban pollution and their effects on human health. © 2020 by the authors.",,No,No,No
Impact of urban growth on air quality in Indian cities using hierarchical Bayesian approach,"Several studies have found rising ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in urban areas across developing countries. For setting mitigation policies source-contribution is needed, which is calculated mostly through computationally intensive chemical transport models or manpower intensive source apportionment studies. Data based approach that use remote sensing datasets can help reduce this challenge, specially in developing countries which lack spatially and temporally dense air quality monitoring networks. Our objective was identifying relative contribution of urban emission sources to monthly PM2.5 ambient concentrations and assessing whether urban expansion can explain rise of PM2.5 ambient concentration from 2001 to 2015 in 15 Indian cities. We adapted the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) emission framework in a land use regression (LUR) model to estimate concentrations by statistically modeling the impact of urban growth on aerosol concentrations with the help of remote sensing datasets. Contribution to concentration from six key sources (residential, industrial, commercial, crop fires, brick kiln and vehicles) was estimated by inverse distance weighting of their emissions in the land-use regression model. A hierarchical Bayesian approach was used to account for the random effects due to the heterogeneous emitting sources in the 15 cities. Long-term ambient PM2.5 concentration from 2001 to 2015, was represented by a indicator R (varying from 0 to 100), decomposed from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived AOD (aerosol optical depth) and angstrom exponent datasets. The model was trained on annual-level spatial land-use distribution and technological advancement data and the monthly-level emission activity of 2001 and 2011 over each location to predict monthly R. The results suggest that above the central portion of a city, concentration due to primary PM2.5 emission is contributed mostly by residential areas (35.0 ± 11.9%), brick kilns (11.7 ± 5.2%) and industries (4.2 ± 2.8%). The model performed moderately for most cities (median correlation for out of time validation was 0.52), especially when assumed changes in seasonal emissions for each source reflected actual seasonal changes in emissions. The results suggest the need for policies focusing on emissions from residential regions and brick kilns. The relative order of the contributions estimated by this study is consistent with other recent studies and a contribution of up to 42.8 ± 14.1% is attributed to the formation of secondary aerosol, long-range transport and unaccounted sources in surrounding regions. The strength of this approach is to be able to estimate the contribution of urban growth to primary aerosols statistically with a relatively low computation cost compared to the more accurate but computationally expensive chemical transport based models. This remote sensing based approach is especially useful in locations without emission inventory. © 2019 by the authors.",,No,No,No
"Influence of semi- and intermediate-volatile organic compounds (S/IVOC) parameterizations, volatility distributions and aging schemes on organic aerosol modelling in winter conditions","This study presents a high–resolution (5 km) set of new simulations performed with CAMx v6.40 over the Po Valley area (Northern Italy), aimed to enhance organic aerosol (OA) levels prediction and to gain insight into the sensitivity of CAMx to different uncertain features of the input setup. In particular, we mainly investigated the role of (i) volatility distributions of organic emissions, (ii) parametrizations of semi– and intermediate–volatile organic compounds (S/IVOC) emissions and (iii) different aging schemes, by exploiting the latest experimental information available in the recent scientific literature. Model results were validated against two OA–specific datasets, available for both an urban site (Bologna, February 2013) and a rural one (Ispra, March 2013). We found out a remarkable performance enhancement of modelled OA levels when applying revisions in S/IVOC emission parametrizations together with the new volatility distributions, at both the validation sites. This performance enhancement is associated with a very significant improvement in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) prediction, mainly due to revised IVOC emissions. At Bologna urban site, mean fractional bias (MFB) of OA ranged from −80.1% in the worst run to −10.1% in the best one and index of agreement (IOA) from 0.52 to 0.75. Notable improvements but overall poorer metrics were found for Ispra site, where MFB ranges from −84.2% to −35% and IOA from 0.45 to 0.50. These findings indicate that organic matter in the semi– and intermediate–volatile range are most likely underestimated in official emission inventories for each main source category (i.e. biomass burning, diesel and gasoline vehicles exhaust). Finally, model results did not show a very pronounced sensitivity to aging processes, due to the low photochemical activity typically observed during winter–time. However, we give evidence that enabling aging processes for biomass burning related SOA, which is by default disabled in CAMx v6.40, can help in closing the gap between modelled and observed SOA concentrations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Precipitation chemistry and stable isotopic characteristics at Wengguo in the northern slopes of the Himalayas,"The major ions in precipitation can reflect the conditions of the atmosphere, while stable isotopic characteristics provide information on the moisture source. In order to understand the local hydro-chemical features and regional geochemical cycle, it is essential to assess the chemical composition of precipitation and the associated sources. Therefore, a total of 57 precipitation samples (2016 to 2017) for major ions and 178 samples (2013 to 2017) for stable isotopes were collected from the Wengguo station and analyzed to explore the major ionic deposition and stable isotopic characteristics in the northern slopes of the Himalayas. The average pH and electrical conductivity were 6.82 ± 0.45 and 15.36 ± 11.67 μS cm−1, respectively. Ca2+ followed by K+ and Mg2+ played a crucial role in neutralizing the precipitation acidity. The major ionic sources in the region were terrigenous (Ca2+, HCO3−, and Mg2+) and sea salt (Na+, Cl−, and Mg2+), as well as anthropogenic emissions (SO42− and NO3−) and biomass burning (K+). The total deposition flux of the major ions was higher in 2016 than in 2017 and was influenced by the higher precipitation. The average values of δ18O and δD in precipitation were − 15.22 ± 5.17 ‰ and − 116.01 ± 41.31 ‰, respectively. The precipitation stable isotopes were not significantly correlated to the local air temperature but the precipitation amount. Moreover, the variation in stable isotopes, local meteoric water line, and d-excess indicated the existence of continental and monsoon moisture transport systems. The transport of chemicals over the high elevation region from polluted cities in South Asia via moisture originating in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea was determined based on the source identification, clusters of air mass backward trajectory analysis, and the National Center for Environmental Prediction Final dataset. Thus, the ionic concentrations and stable isotopic characteristics of the precipitation from this study provided a valuable dataset to assess the atmospheric environment in the northern slopes of the Himalayas at Southern Tibetan Plateau. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",,No,No,No
Constructing a data-driven receptor model for organic and inorganic aerosol - A synthesis analysis of eight mass spectrometric data sets from a boreal forest site,"The interactions between organic and inorganic aerosol chemical components are integral to understanding and modelling climate and health-relevant aerosol physicochemical properties, such as volatility, hygroscopicity, light scattering and toxicity. This study presents a synthesis analysis for eight data sets, of non-refractory aerosol composition, measured at a boreal forest site. The measurements, performed with an aerosol mass spectrometer, cover in total around 9 months over the course of 3 years. In our statistical analysis, we use the complete organic and inorganic unit-resolution mass spectra, as opposed to the more common approach of only including the organic fraction. The analysis is based on iterative, combined use of (1) data reduction, (2) classification and (3) scaling tools, producing a data-driven chemical mass balance type of model capable of describing site-specific aerosol composition. The receptor model we constructed was able to explain 83±8 % of variation in data, which increased to 96±3 % when signals from low signal-to-noise variables were not considered. The resulting interpretation of an extensive set of aerosol mass spectrometric data infers seven distinct aerosol chemical components for a rural boreal forest site: ammonium sulfate (35±7 % of mass), low and semi-volatile oxidised organic aerosols (27±8 % and 12±7 %), biomass burning organic aerosol (11±7 %), a nitrate-containing organic aerosol type (7±2 %), ammonium nitrate (5±2 %), and hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (3±1 %). Some of the additionally observed, rare outlier aerosol types likely emerge due to surface ionisation effects and likely represent amine compounds from an unknown source and alkaline metals from emissions of a nearby district heating plant. Compared to traditional, ion-balance-based inorganics apportionment schemes for aerosol mass spectrometer data, our statistics-based method provides an improved, more robust approach, yielding readily useful information for the modelling of submicron atmospheric aerosols physical and chemical properties. The results also shed light on the division between organic and inorganic aerosol types and dynamics of salt formation in aerosol. Equally importantly, the combined methodology exemplifies an iterative analysis, using consequent analysis steps by a combination of statistical methods. Such an approach offers new ways to home in on physicochemically sensible solutions with minimal need for a priori information or analyst interference. We therefore suggest that similar statistics-based approaches offer significant potential for un- or semi-supervised machine-learning applications in future analyses of aerosol mass spectrometric data. © 2019 Author(s).",,No,No,No
"The climate, the fuel and the land use: Long-term regional variability of biomass burning in boreal forests","The influence of different drivers on changes in North American and European boreal forests biomass burning (BB) during the Holocene was investigated based on the following hypotheses: land use was important only in the southernmost regions, while elsewhere climate was the main driver modulated by changes in fuel type. BB was reconstructed by means of 88 sedimentary charcoal records divided into six different site clusters. A statistical approach was used to explore the relative contribution of (a) pollen-based mean July/summer temperature and mean annual precipitation reconstructions, (b) an independent model-based scenario of past land use (LU), and (c) pollen-based reconstructions of plant functional types (PFTs) on BB. Our hypotheses were tested with: (a) a west-east northern boreal sector with changing climatic conditions and a homogeneous vegetation, and (b) a north-south European boreal sector characterized by gradual variation in both climate and vegetation composition. The processes driving BB in boreal forests varied from one region to another during the Holocene. However, general trends in boreal biomass burning were primarily controlled by changes in climate (mean annual precipitation in Alaska, northern Quebec, and northern Fennoscandia, and mean July/summer temperature in central Canada and central Fennoscandia) and, secondarily, by fuel composition (BB positively correlated with the presence of boreal needleleaf evergreen trees in Alaska and in central and southern Fennoscandia). Land use played only a marginal role. A modification towards less flammable tree species (by promoting deciduous stands over fire-prone conifers) could contribute to reduce circumboreal wildfire risk in future warmer periods. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,No,No,No
Burned area estimations derived from Landsat ETM+ and OLI data: Comparing Genetic Programming with Maximum Likelihood and Classification and Regression Trees,"Every year, large areas of savannas and woodlands burn due to natural conditions and land management practices. Given the relevant level of greenhouse gas emissions produced by biomass burning in tropical regions, it is becoming even more important to clearly define historic fire regimes so that prospective emission reduction management strategies can be well informed, and their results Measured, Reported, and Verified (MRV). Thus, developing tools for accurately, and periodically mapping burned areas, based on cost advantageous, expedite, and repeatable rigorous approaches, is important. The main objective of this study is to investigate the potential of novel Genetic Programming (GP) methodologies for classifying burned areas in satellite imagery over savannas and tropical woodlands and to assess if they can improve over the popular and currently applied methods of Maximum Likelihood classification and Classification and Regression Tree analysis. The tests are performed using three Landsat images from Brazil (South America), Guinea-Bissau (West Africa) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (Central Africa). Burned areas were digitized on-screen to produce mapped information serving as surrogate ground-truth. Validation results show that all methods provide an overestimation of burned area, but GP achieves higher accuracy values in two of the three cases. GP is the most versatile machine learning method available today, but still largely underused in remote sensing. This study shows that standard GP can produce better results than two classical methods, and illustrates its versatility and potential in becoming a mainstream method for more difficult tasks involving the large amounts of newly available data. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

"Southwestern U.S. Biomass Burning Smoke Hygroscopicity: The Role of Plant Phenology, Chemical Composition, and Combustion Properties","Biomass burning emissions have substantially increased with continued warming and drying in the southwestern U.S., impacting air quality and atmospheric processes. To better quantify impacts of biomass burning aerosols, an extensive laboratory study of fresh smoke emissions was conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Laboratory burn experiments with selected native and invasive southwestern U.S. fuels were used to elucidate the role of fuel type, chemical composition, and ignition method on the hygroscopicity of smoke. Here we focus on a custom controlled relative humidity (RH) nephelometry system using the direct measurement of aerosol light scattering with two nephelometers—one at dry conditions and one at a controlled high RH (RH ~ 85%). Aerosol hygroscopicity was highly variable with the enhancement in light scattering coefficient in the range of 1.02 < f(RH = 85%) < 2.1 and corresponding to the kappa parameter (κneph) ranging from ~0 to 0.18. Hygroscopicity is determined primarily by the fuel's inorganic ion content. For example, invasive halophytes with high inorganic salt content exhibit much greater water uptake than native coniferous species with low inorganic content. Combustion temperature and phase, flaming or smoldering, play a secondary role in the water uptake of smoke. High-temperature ignition methods create flaming conditions that enhance hygroscopicity while lower-temperature smoldering conditions diminish hygroscopicity. Our results construct an empirical relation between κneph and the inorganic content of the fuel and smoke to predict water uptake. ©2018. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",,No,No,No
Characterization of organic aerosol across the global remote troposphere: A comparison of ATom measurements and global chemistry models,"The spatial distribution and properties of submicron organic aerosol (OA) are among the key sources of uncertainty in our understanding of aerosol effects on climate. Uncertainties are particularly large over remote regions of the free troposphere and Southern Ocean, where very few data have been available and where OA predictions from AeroCom Phase II global models span 2 to 3 orders of magnitude, greatly exceeding the model spread over source regions. The (nearly) pole-to-pole vertical distribution of nonrefractory aerosols was measured with an aerosol mass spectrometer onboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft as part of the Atmospheric Tomography (ATom) mission during the Northern Hemisphere summer (August 2016) and winter (February 2017). This study presents the first extensive characterization of OA mass concentrations and their level of oxidation in the remote atmosphere. OA and sulfate are the major contributors by mass to submicron aerosols in the remote troposphere, together with sea salt in the marine boundary layer. Sulfate was dominant in the lower stratosphere. OA concentrations have a strong seasonal and zonal variability, with the highest levels measured in the lower troposphere in the summer and over the regions influenced by biomass burning from Africa (up to 10 μgsm-3). Lower concentrations (~ 0:1 0.3 μgsm-3) are observed in the northern middle and high latitudes and very low concentrations (< 0:1 μgsm-3) in the southern middle and high latitudes. The ATom dataset is used to evaluate predictions of eight current global chemistry models that implement a variety of commonly used representations of OA sources and chemistry, as well as of the AeroCom-II ensemble. The current model ensemble captures the average vertical and spatial distribution of measured OA concentrations, and the spread of the individual models remains within a factor of 5. These results are significantly improved over the AeroCom-II model ensemble, which shows large overestimations over these regions. However, some of the improved agreement with observations occurs for the wrong reasons, as models have the tendency to greatly overestimate the primary OA fraction and underestimate the sec-ondary fraction. Measured OA in the remote free troposphere is highly oxygenated, with organic aerosol to organic carbon (OA= OC) ratios of ~ 2.2 2.8, and is 30 % 60% more oxygenated than in current models, which can lead to significant errors in OA concentrations. The model measurement comparisons presented here support the concept of a more dynamic OA system as proposed by Hodzic et al. (2016), with enhanced removal of primary OA and a stronger production of secondary OA in global models needed to provide better agreement with observations. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

Aerosol Optical Characteristics During the Biomass Burning Season in Southeastern Mexico,"In this paper, we present a characterization of the optical properties of the aerosols emitted during biomass burning (BB) season in the period 2005–2009. Trends of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (α), and precipitable water (PW) were analyzed using a 5-year dataset from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations over Tuxtla Gutierrez (TG), Chiapas. The overall mean AOD (500 nm) during the 2005–2009 period was 0.26 ± 0.18. However, monthly mean values of AOD > 0.5 during the spring months (April and May) would indicate the high load of particles emitted by fires. The overall mean of α (440–870 nm) was 1.40 ± 0.21, which confirms the presence of fine aerosols. Additionally, the combined analysis of the α with its spectral curvature δα, and the results from the spectral de-convolution algorithm (SDA) shows that fine-mode aerosols dominated AOD variability in TG. In this paper, the trajectories of air masses (400 and 1500 m, a.s.l.) arriving at the TG site were classified by using backward trajectory cluster analysis. Trajectory clustering results indicate a BB regional transport from Central America that affects the atmosphere in southeastern Mexico. We use observations of fire radiative power (FRP) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to study the incidence of wildfires and to estimate the BB emissions from 2005 to 2009 in southeastern Mexico. The results indicated a gradual decrease in fires throughout the years. Campeche and Yucatan are the states in southeastern Mexico where BB produces the highest emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), black carbon (BC), and particulate material PM2.5. However, the largest emissions come from wildfires in Guatemala. Finally, to put in context the aerosol optical properties over southeastern Mexico, the sun photometric measurements in TG are compared with those retrieved from AERONET stations located in other tropical biomass burning regions (Brazil and Zambia). © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,No,No,No
The impact of crop residue burning (CRB) on the diurnal and seasonal variability of the ozone and PM levels at a semi-urban site in the north-western Indo-Gangetic plain,"Ozone and particulate matter (PM), PM 10 and PM 2.5, were monitored along with meteorological parameters at a semi-urban location, Patiala, in the north-western Indo-Gangetic plain from December 2013 to November 2014. The annual mean concentration levels of PM 10, PM 2.5 and ozone were recorded as 178 μgm-3,88μgm-3 and 39 ppb, which also exceeded the national standards on a 24-h average basis, by 77.3% (335 days), 53.2% (338 days) and 20 days, respectively. High levels of PM (PM 10 and PM 2.5) were observed in winter (58–381 and 42–270 μgm-3) and in the post-monsoon (71–320 and 39–320 μgm-3) season and a rise in the level of ozone was observed in summer (22–72 ppb) and in the post-monsoon season (23–73 ppb), respectively. The rate of ozone production was the highest during the post-harvest fire period (3.94ppbO3/h in May and 4.23 ppb O 3/h in November). A Pearson correlation study showed the strong dependency of PM and ozone on meteorological variables. Relative humidity has the highest ranking for ozone and PM 10, while wind speed has the lowest rank for ozone, PM 10 and PM 2.5 in the order of factors affecting the level of pollutants.

Construction and characterization of an indoor smog chamber for measuring the optical and physicochemical properties of aging biomass burning aerosols," We describe here the construction and characterization of a new combustion-chamber system (the NCAT chamber) for studying the optical and physicochemical properties of biomass burning (BB) aerosols.

Quantifying impacts of crop residue burning in the North China Plain on summertime tropospheric ozone over East Asia,"Crop residue burning has been proved to have negative impacts on regional atmospheric environment. In this study, an evidence-based statistical modeling framework was established to quantify potential impacts of crop residue burning in the North China Plain (NCP) on summertime tropospheric ozone increase over East Asia during 2004–2016. To assess the intensity of crop residue burning, fire occurrence counts derived from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites were used as a proxy. Additionally, another six factors were employed as potent explanatory variables. Maximum covariance analysis was first applied to decouple spatiotemporal interactions between tropospheric ozone and each explanatory variable. Based on the decoupled modes, multivariate linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to establish statistical relationships between tropospheric ozone and contributing factors, respectively. The results indicate that the ANN-based modeling scheme enables to approximate the observed tropospheric ozone variations better than MLR. Further investigations reveal that the summertime crop residue burning in the NCP is the predominant factor contributing to the observed additive tropospheric ozone increases over East Asia, yielding extra 8% tropospheric ozone elevation on average in June. Moreover, UV radiation and wind also played critical roles in modulating the observed tropospheric ozone variations therein. In general, the critical role of crop residue burning over the NCP in modulating summertime tropospheric ozone increase over East Asia have been well demonstrated based on the proposed evidenced-based modeling framework. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Estimating the open biomass burning emissions in central and eastern China from 2003 to 2015 based on satellite observation,"Open biomass burning (OBB) has significant impacts on air pollution, climate change and potential human health. OBB has gathered wide attention but with little focus on the annual variation of pollutant emission. Central and eastern China (CEC) is one of the most polluted regions in China. This study aims to provide a state-of-the-art estimation of the pollutant emissions from OBB in CEC from 2003 to 2015, by adopting the satellite observation dataset - the burned area product (MCD64Al) and the active fire product (MCD14 ML) - along with local biomass data (updated biomass loading data and high-resolution vegetation data) and local emission factors. The successful adoption of the double satellite dataset for long-term estimation of pollutants from OBB with a high spatial resolution can support the assessing of OBB on regional air quality, especially for harvest periods or dry seasons. It is also useful to evaluate the effects of annual OBB management policies in different regions. Here, monthly emissions of pollutants were estimated and allocated into a 1×1km spatial grid for four types of OBB including grassland, shrubland, forest and cropland. From 2003 to 2015, the emissions from forest, shrubland and grassland fire burning had an annual fluctuation, whereas the emissions from crop straw burning steadily increased. The cumulative emissions of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), methane (CH4), nitric oxide (NO x), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and fine particles (PM2.5) were 3.64×103, 2.87×102, 3.05×103, 1.82×103, 6.4×103, 2.12×102, 4.67×102, 4.59×104, 9.39×105 and 4.13×103Gg in these years, respectively. Crop straw burning was the largest contributor for all pollutant emissions, by 84%-96%. For the forest, shrubland and grassland fire burning, forest fire burning emissions contributed the most, and emissions from grassland fire were negligible due to little grass coverage in this region. High pollutant emissions concentrated in the connection area of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu and Anhui, with emission intensity higher than 100 tons per square kilometer, which was related to the frequent agricultural activities in these regions. Peak emission of pollutants occurred during summer and autumn harvest periods including May, June, September and October, during which 1/4 50% of the total pollutant emissions were emitted in these months. This study highlights the importance of controlling the crop straw burning emissions. From December to March, the crop residue burning emissions decreased, while the emissions from forest, shrubland and grassland exhibited their highest values, leading to another small peak in emissions of pollutants. Obvious regional differences in seasonal variations of OBB were observed due to different local biomass types and environmental conditions. Rural population, agricultural output, economic levels, local burning habits, social customs and management policies were all influencing factors for OBB emissions. © Author(s) 2018.",,No,No,No
Highly time-resolved aerosol characteristics during springtime in Weizhou Island,"A single particle aerosol mass spectrometer was deployed to measure the changes of single particle species and sizes during March 2015 in Weizhou Island of the Beibu Gulf, Guangxi province, South China. In this campaign, a total of 3,100,597 particles were sized, and 25.8% particles with both positive and negative mass spectrum were collected and 24.8% characterized in combination with the ART-2a neural network algorithm. The distribution of sized particles was mainly in from 520 to 600 nm, and the diameters ranging from 340 to 1000 nm accounted for above 90%. Eight types of particles were classified: Elemental Carbon containing (EC), Organic Carbon containing (OC), EC and OC combined containing particles, Na containing particles, K containing particles (K), Levoglucosan containing particles, mineral containing particles, and Heavy Metal containing particles (HM). EC, OC and K were the major containing particles, which accounted for 84.3% in the eight types particles. The relative ratio and size distribution of the three types were EC (48.1%, 620 nm), OC (12.7%, 440 nm), and K (23.5%, 600 nm), respectively. The three types of particles were a bit increasing ratios compared with those in clean periods during haze pollution periods. Combined with the back-trajectory results from the Hysplit-4 model and local pollution sources revealed that the ambient air quality on the Weizhou Island may be influenced by biomass burning in the Indochina Peninsula (biomass burning in the Indochina Peninsula) from the transportation on higher level atmospheric layer and by mainland of south China located northeast of Weizhou Island on the ground. © 2017",,No,No,No
"Ambient wintertime particulate air pollution and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in Monroe County, New York","Background: Previous studies have reported associations between ambient fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). However, none have examined whether ultrafine particles (UFP; < 100 nm), accumulation mode particles (AMP; 100–500 nm), markers of traffic pollution (black carbon; BC), or wood burning (Delta-C; (30% of ambient wintertime PM2.5 in Monroe County, NY is from wood burning)) are associated with an increased odds of HDP. We estimated the odds of HDP associated with increased concentrations of PM2.5, UFP, AMP, BC, and Delta-C in each gestational month during winter months. Methods: Electronic medical records and birth certificate data were linked with land-use regression models in Monroe County, New York in 2009–2013 to predict monthly pollutant concentrations during winter (November-April) based on maternal residential address for 16,637 births. Using multivariable logistic regression, we estimated the odds of HDP associated with each interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5, UFP, AMP, BC, and Delta-C concentrations during each gestational month, adjusting for maternal characteristics, birth hospital, temperature, and relative humidity. Results: Each 0.52 µg/m3 increase in Delta-C concentration during the 7th gestational month was associated with an increased odds of HDP (odds ratio (OR) = 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01, 1.45), with a similar sized estimate in month 8 (OR = 1.18; 95%CI = 0.98, 1.43). Non-statistically significant increased odds of HDP associated with IQR increases in BC concentrations during months 3 (OR = 1.12; 95%CI = 0.98, 1.28) and 7 (OR = 1.12; 95%CI = 0.96, 1.29) were observed. Increased odds of HDP were not observed for PM2.5, UFP, or AMP. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that maternal exposure to wood smoke in Monroe County during winter is associated with an increased odds of HDP during late gestation. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effect of wood smoke on HDP and to explore effects on other pregnancy outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,No,No,No
"A comprehensive inventory of agricultural atmospheric particulate matters (PM10 and PM2.5) and gaseous pollutants (VOCs, SO2, NH3, CO, NOx and HC) emissions in China","Atmospheric pollutants emitted from agriculture are a key factor in regional air quality. However, previous studies of agricultural sources have only focused on agricultural burning, livestock or fertilizer; comprehensive agricultural emission inventories involving main agricultural operations are still lacking in China, which would limit our ability to understand, predict and control the effects of agricultural emissions on air quality and human health. This study presents the latest county-level sector-specific emission inventories of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and gaseous pollutants (VOCs, SO2, NH3, CO and NOx) from six agricultural sectors, including land preparation, crop harvesting, crop residue burning, grain processing, fertilizer application and agricultural machinery, based on a bottom-up emission estimation method. Agricultural activity data were collected from statistical yearbooks, and emission factors of each operation were adopted from published data. Annual emissions of PM10, PM2.5, VOCs, SO2, NH3, CO, and NOx from agricultural operations during 2015 in China were estimated to be 2867.4 Gg, 1941.1 Gg, 2321.9 Gg, 139.6 Gg, 1072.7 Gg, 10149.9 Gg and 1433.2 Gg, respectively. Higher pollutant emissions are found in Eastern and Central China. Atmospheric pollutant emissions show a primary peak in October in North, Northeast, Northwest and Southwest and in June and July in other regions. The historic trends (1997–2015) of agricultural emissions have shown annual average growth rates of 0.9%/yr, 1.3%/yr, 1.5%/yr, 2.5%/yr, 1.1%/yr, 1.2%/yr and 0.6%/yr for PM10, PM2.5, VOCs, NOx, SO2, CO and NH3, respectively. The detailed agricultural emission inventory generated by this study could provide useful information for air quality modeling and support the development of appropriate pollution control strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
"Azolla pinnata, Aspergillus terreus, and Eisenia fetida for fasterrecycling of nutrients from wheat straw","A vast amount of surplus wheat straw/stubble (a carbon-rich bioresource) is wasted every year by burning. Harmful gases and residue matter released due to burning cause harmful effects on the environment and human health. Therefore, there is a strong need to recycle this bioresource in a sustainable manner. In the present study, wheat straw (W) was spiked with cattle dung (C), Azolla pinnata (A), and Aspergillus terreus (F) to make eight different treatments (1 kg each), viz. W (1 kg), WC (666 g + 334 g), WA (980 g + 20 g), WF (980 g + 20 ml), WCF (666 g + 314 g + 20 ml), WCA (666 g + 314 g + 20 g), WFA (960 g+ 20 ml + 20 g), and WCFA(666 g + 294 g + 20 ml + 20 g), and subjected to vermicomposting (Vcom) and aerobic composting (Acom). A comparison was made for the time required for degradation and nutrient profile of the products. The fastest recycling of wheat straw/stubble (120 days) was observed in WCA and WCFA, but the nutrient quality of WCA was better (N 18.67, P 3.88, K 38.84 g/kg). In the Acom group, longer time was required for degradation of various mixtures, but in this group also, WCA was degraded first of all (138 days) and yielded a product with the best nutrient quality (N 14.77, P 2.56, K 28.80 g/kg). Maximum growth of E. fetida and maximum number of hatchlings were observed in WCA while the highest cocoon production was observed in WCFA. It was observed that azolla enhanced conversion of wheat straw into a nutrient-rich product for agronomic use. Thus its use will reduce the amount of cattle dung in the mixture and the bulk to be handled by the farmers for ecosafe disposal of surplus straw/stubble. Therefore, this technology can be adopted as an alternative to burning. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,No,No,No
Characterization of the radiative impact of aerosols on CO2 and energy fluxes in the Amazon deforestation arch using artificial neural networks,"In vegetation canopies with complex architectures, diffuse solar radiation can enhance carbon assimilation through photosynthesis because isotropic light is able to reach deeper layers of the canopy. Although this effect has been studied in the past decade, the mechanisms and impacts of this enhancement over South America remain poorly understood. Over the Amazon deforestation arch large amounts of aerosols are released into the atmosphere due to biomass burning, which provides an ideal scenario for further investigation of this phenomenon in the presence of canopies with complex architecture. In this paper, the relation of aerosol optical depth and surface fluxes of mass and energy are evaluated over three study sites with artificial neural networks and radiative transfer modeling. Results indicate a significant effect of the aerosol on the flux of carbon dioxide between the vegetation and the atmosphere, as well as on energy exchange, including that surface fluxes are sensitive to second-order radiative impacts of aerosols on temperature, humidity, and friction velocity. <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CO2</span> exchanges increased in the presence of aerosol in up to 55&thinsp;% in sites with complex canopy architecture. A decrease of approximately 12&thinsp;% was observed for a site with shorter vegetation. Energy fluxes were negatively impacted by aerosols over all study sites.. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

Assessment and quantification of NOx sources at a regional background site in North China: Comparative results from a Bayesian isotopic mixing model and a positive matrix factorization model,"Regional sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in North China during summer were explored using both a Bayesian isotopic mixing model and a positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. Results showed that the nitrogen isotope (δ15N) composition of particulate nitrate (NO3                             −) varied between −8.9‰ and +14.1‰ while the oxygen isotope (δ18O) composition ranged from +57.4‰ to +93.8‰. Based on results from the Bayesian isotopic mixing model, the contribution of the hydroxyl radical (•OH) NOx conversion pathway showed clear diurnal fluctuation; values were higher during the day (0.53 ± 0.16) and lower overnight (0.42 ± 0.17). Values peaked at 06:00–12:00 and then decreased gradually until 00:00–06:00 the next day. Coal combustion (31.34 ± 9.04%) was the most significant source of NOx followed by biomass burning (25.74 ± 2.58%), mobile sources (23.83 ± 3.66%), and microbial processes (19.09 ± 5.21%). PMF results indicated that the contribution from mobile sources was 19.83%, slightly lower as compared to the Bayesian model (23.83%). The PMF model also reported a lower contribution from coal combustion (28.65%) as compared to the Bayesian model (31.34%); however, the sum of biomass burning and microbial processes in the Bayesian model (44.83%) was lower than the aggregate of secondary inorganic aerosol, sea salt, and soil dust in PMF model (51.52%). Overall, differences between the two models were minor, suggesting that this study provided a reasonable source quantification for NOx in North China during summer. Resulting NOx source difference from Bayesian isotopic mixing model and PMF model in North China was minor with the largest discrepancy of 6.69%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Assessment of Agricultural Practices from Sentinel 1 and 2 Images Applied on Rice Fields to Develop a Farm Typology in the Camargue Region,"In the global change context, an efficient management of the available resources has become one of the most important topics particularly for the sustainable crop development. Many questions concern the evolution of the rice farming systems in Camargue in Southeastern France, which play a crucial role in controlling the soil salinity. Their surface area significantly decreased from 20 000 ha in 2010 to 14 000 ha in 2014. The arrival of the new Sentinel satellites makes it possible to evaluate these crop evolutions. The objectives of this study were to propose operational methodologies to accurately assess the surface areas of the main crops, rice, wheat, and grassland, from classifications based on multispectral data; map agricultural practices (sowing and harvest residue burning); and elaborate a farm typology based on variables computed from remote sensing data to better understand the farming strategies. Dense time series of Sentinel images acquired at high spatial resolution (10 m) were analyzed for 2016 and 2017. A satisfactory accuracy was obtained for land use classification with 88% of correctly classified fields. The accuracy obtained for the estimation of the sowing date varied according to the studied year from 8 to 12 days, and burned areas were correctly identified (80%). The farm typology allowed to cluster farms at the territory level. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",,No,No,No
"First two and a half years of aerosol measurements with an AERONET sunphotometer at the Huancayo Observatory, Peru","Direct sun measurements with a CIMEL sunphotometer belonging to the AERONET network have been performed in the Huancayo Observatory, Peru, from March 2015 to August 2017, two and a half years, providing for the first time information about aerosols in the specific area. The prevalence of background conditions in the measurement site has been determined for the period of study. These conditions, which constitute more than 80% of cases, are occasionally altered, mainly by high aerosols loading, as a consequence of biomass-burning events. Biomass-burning periods cover every year from mid-July to mid-October. The identification of these periods has been possible through the classification of aerosols in 6 subtypes. The month with the maximum AOD monthly average is September, and in 2016, the absolute maximum value of 0.91 was registered. The mean AOD value for the study period is 0.10 ± 0.07 and the alpha mean value is 1.49 ± 0.36, indicating presence, of small size aerosols. Some aerosol optical properties were analyzed in order to validate the aerosol classification. The aerosol size distribution revealed a bimodal character with a slight predominance of the fine mode, related to the two main types of aerosols: continental and biomass. © 2019",,No,No,No
Characterization of the chemical components and bioreactivity of fine particulate matter produced during crop-residue burning in China,"Five types of crop residue (rice, wheat, corn, sorghum, and sugarcane) collected from different provinces in China were used to characterize the chemical components and bioreactivity properties of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions during open-burning scenarios. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were the most abundant components, contributing 41.7%–54.9% of PM2.5 emissions. The OC/EC ratio ranged from 8.8 to 31.2, indicating that organic matter was the dominant component of emissions. Potassium and chloride were the most abundant components in the portion of PM2.5 composed of water-soluble ions. The coefficient of divergence ranged from 0.27 to 0.51 among various emissions profiles. All samples exposed to a high PM2.5 concentration (150 μg/mL) exhibited a significant reduction in cell viability (A549 lung alveolar epithelial cells) and increase in lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and interleukin 6 levels compared with those exposed to 20 or 0 μg/mL. Higher bioreactivity (determined according to LDH and interleukin 6 level) was observed for the rice, wheat, and corn samples than for the sorghum straw samples. Pearson's correlation analysis suggested that OC, heavy metals (chromium, manganese, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, and barium), and water-soluble ions (fluoride, calcium, and sulfate) are the components potentially associated with LDH production. The PM2.5 components emitted during biomass burning were characterized and proved to be correlated with oxidative and inflammatory responses in A549 cells. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
"Source apportionment using receptor model based on aerosol mass spectra and 1 h resolution chemical dataset in Tianjin, China","Source apportionment studies have been performed on online receptor datasets in recent years (called online source apportionment), including mass spectra and online chemical dataset. Single particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS), an important online technique, has the ability to analyze mass spectrum (MS) and particular size information of a single particle in real time. Clustering methods have been widely applied to MS dataset to investigate the sources of particles, although the receptor models are the common tools to probe the particle sources based on the receptor dataset. This work developed a new method (SPAMS-RM) that employed the receptor model (RM) on an MS dataset from SPAMS to identify particle sources. Particles were measured by SPAMS from July 14 to August 15, 2015, at an urban site in Tianjin, China. Multilinear Engine-2 (ME2) and adaptive resonance theory-based neural networks-2a (ART-2a) were separately used to analyze the single particle MS dataset. This work also evaluated the performance of SPAMS-RM method. Concentrations of chemical components of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm) and gaseous pollutants were measured by independent online instruments (1 h resolution). Source apportionment was separately conducted using two receptor models, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and ME2, based on the 1 h resolution chemical dataset. This method was called online chemical source apportionment (OCSA-RM). ART-2a obtained 19 clusters that merged into five major classes: carbon species, rich-K, sea salt, crustal dust, and industrial metals. SPAMS-RM identified eight sources by interpreting the MS characteristic of factors and investigating the relationship of the temporal trends of factor contributions, chemical species, gaseous pollutants, and particle clusters. OCSA-ME2 and OCSA-PMF both identified seven factors. Source apportionment results between SPAMS-RM and OCSA-ME2/PMF were compared. Each method identified coal combustion, biomass burning, sea salt, nitrate source, sulfate source, vehicle emission, and crustal dust. The SPAMS-RM results showed that nitrate source was the most significant contributor (34%) to the PM followed by sulfate source (17%), coal combustion (14%), crustal dust (11%), vehicle emission (10%), biomass burning-OCEC (7%), and industrial activities & sea salt (4%). Some differences between SPAMS-RM and OCSA-ME2/PMF results existed and might be due to chemical analysis methods and sampling methods. ME2 was used for the first time to identify the PM sources based on the MS dataset from SPAMS and demonstrated its capability when coupled with MS dataset from SPAMS to apportion the source of PM. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
"Temporal variations and characteristics of the carbonaceous species in PM2.5 measured at anmyeon island, a background site in Korea","Routine measurements of carbonaceous species in PM2.5 inculidng organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and humiclike-substance carbon (HULIS-C) in PM2.5 were performed at Anmyeon Island (AI) to clarify the seasonal variation and carbonaceous aerosol concentrations at a background site in Korea between 2015 and 2016. The annual average OC and EC concentrations were 4.52±3.25 μg/m3 and 0.46±0.28 μg/m3, respectively, and there were no clear seasonal variations in OC and EC concentrations. The average concentrations of WSOC and waterinsoluble organic carbon (WISOC) were 2.56±1.95 μg/m3 and 1.96±1.45 μg/m3, respectively, and their composition in OC showed high temporal variations. A low correlation between WISOC and EC was observed, while WSOC concentrations were highly correlated with secondary organic carbon concentrations, which were estimated using the EC tracer method. The results indicate that the formation of secondary organic aerosols is a major factor for the determination of WSOC concentrations in this region. HULIS-C was the major component of WSOC, accounting for 39-99% of WSOC and the average concentration was 1.88±1.52 μg/m3. Two distinct periods with high carbonaceous speciess in PM2.5 were observed and characterized by their OC/EC ratios. The high concentration of OC with high ratio of OC/EC was due to the influence of a mixture of emissions from biomass burning and secondary formation transported from outside AI. While, the high concentrations of OC and EC with low OC/EC ratio were related to local vehicular emissions. © 2020 by Asian Journal of Atmospheric Environment.",,No,No,No
The role of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi in the decomposition of fresh residue and soil organic carbon: A mini-review,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widespread in terrestrial ecosystems. In addition to their contributions to plant nutrient uptake, AMF also provide many ecological functions including regulation of soil C dynamics. However, both stimulating and retarding soil organic decomposition by AMF have been observed. Here we discuss the possible reasons for such a contradiction. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi contribute to soil aggregation mainly through hyphal enmeshment, saprotrophic suppression, and production of glomalin-related soil proteins, while AMF can also stimulate organic decomposition through promoting degradative enzymes, modifying root production and activity, and/or through regulating the microbial community in the mycorrhizosphere and hyphosphere. The role of AMF in C decomposition is strongly dependent on the quality and quantity of different soil C pools. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can stimulate fresh residue decomposition initially through stimulating the decomposition of fresh residues (particularly those having high C/N ratio), whereas for older or decomposed soil organic C, AMF tend to suppress decomposition by promoting soil aggregation. Under elevated CO2 (eCO2), AMF show additive effects on residue decomposition, priming effects, and changes in soil aggregation. Despite organic decomposition rates differing in the short term and long term following litter experiments, our discussion highlights the role of AMF in organic C dynamics. We hypothesize that AMF would benefit soil C gain in the long term and thereby predict that disturbances that impacts negatively on AMF, such as tillage, residue burning, fertilization, and fungicide application, would lead to soil C decline particularly under eCO2                              © 2019 The Author(s).",,No,No,No
"Retrievals of Aerosol Size Distribution, Spherical Fraction, and Complex Refractive Index From Airborne In Situ Angular Light Scattering and Absorption Measurements","Aerosol models, composed of size distribution, complex refractive index, and spherical fraction, are derived from a new synergistic retrieval of airborne in situ angular scattering measurements made by the Polarized Imaging Nephelometer and absorption measurements from the Particle Soot Absorption Photometer. The data utilized include phase function (F11), degree of polarization (−F12/F11), and absorption coefficient (βabs) measured at low relative humidities during the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) and Deep Convection Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaigns. The Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties (GRASP) is applied to these measurements to obtain summaries of particle properties that are optically consistent with the original measurements. A classification scheme is then used to categorize the corresponding retrieval results. Inversions performed on the DC3 measurements indicate the presence of a significant amount of dust-like aerosol in the inflow of storms sampled during this campaign, with the quantity of dust present depending strongly on the underlying surface features. In the SEAC4RS data, the retrieved size distributions were found to be remarkably similar among a range of aerosol types, including urban and industrial, biogenic, and biomass burning (BB) emissions. These aerosol types were found to have average fine mode volume median radii 0.155 ≤ rvf ≤ 0.163μm and lognormal standard deviations 0.32 ≤ σf ≤ 0.36. There were, however, consistent differences between the angular scattering patterns of the BB samples and the other particle types. The GRASP retrieval predominantly attributed these differences to elevated real and imaginary refractive indices in the BB samples (m532nm≈1.55+0.007i) relative to the two other categories (m532nm≈1.51+0.004i). ©2019.

Simulated polarization as a signature of aerosol type,"We present a technique for determining aerosol type using simulated values of degree of linear polarization as a function of scattering angle. The simulated polarization is determined from retrieved values of the indices of refraction and size parameters as determined from AERONET data sets for aerosols at various sites which we characterize as Urban/Industrial, Biomass-burning, Dust, Maritime and Mixed. We find that each type of aerosol has a characteristic simulated polarization “signature”. The calculated simulated degree of polarization for a particular aerosol observation is compared with a set of standard simulated polarizations using the Frechet distance between the curves. The aerosol type is given by the minimum Frechet distance. We emphasize that the simulated polarization is not the same as the measured polarization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Combustion process of a Korean wood pellet at a low temperature,"In this study, the combustion process of a Korean wood pellet was observed through experiments and numerical analysis from 500 °C which is low temperature. Based on the experimental results, the combustion process was classified into gasification, flame burning, and char burning. In every phase of the combustion process, flame shape, mass change, and conversion time were measured and compared with the data in the literature. At lower temperatures, the gasification process occupied a significant portion of the overall conversion time and flame burning time reduces. Numerical analysis shows that the temperature inside the pellet was uneven in the flame burning mode but it became uniform in the char burning mode. Conversion time was predicted accurately through numerical simulation at 800 °C, but numerical prediction deviated from the experimental data at a low temperature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
High-time-resolution source apportionment of PM2.5 in Beijing with multiple models,"Beijing has suffered from heavy local emissions as well as regional transport of air pollutants, resulting in severe atmospheric fine-particle (PM2.5) pollution. This study developed a combined method to investigate source types of PM2.5 and its source regions during winter 2016 in Beijing, which include the receptor model (positive matrix factorization, PMF), footprint and an air quality model. The PMF model was performed with high-time-resolution measurements of trace elements, water soluble ions, organic carbon and elemental carbon using online instruments during the wintertime campaign of the Air Pollution and Human Health in a Chinese Megacity-Beijing (APHH-Beijing) program in 2016. Source types and their contributions estimated by PMF model using online measurements were linked with source regions identified by the footprint model, and the regional transport contribution was estimated by an air quality model (the Nested Air Quality Prediction Model System, NAQPMS) to analyze the specific sources and source regions during haze episodes. Our results show that secondary and biomass-burning sources were dominated by regional transport, while the coal combustion source increased with local contribution, suggesting that strict control strategies for local coal combustion in Beijing and a reduction of biomass-burning and gaseous precursor emissions in surrounding areas were essential to improve air quality in Beijing. The combination of PMF with footprint results revealed that secondary sources were mainly associated with southern footprints (53 %). The northern footprint was characterized by a high dust source contribution (11 %), while industrial sources increased with the eastern footprint (10 %). The results demonstrated the power of combining receptor model-based source apportionment with other models in understanding the formation of haze episodes and identifying specific sources from different source regions affecting air quality in Beijing. © Author(s) 2019.",,No,No,No
"Classification of aerosols using multiple clustering techniques over Zanjan, Iran, during 2010-2014","A more detailed study and identification of aerosol types can help to better understand the sources and effects of aerosols. In the present study, a number of optical properties of aerosols have been investigated seasonal for discrimination of aerosol types during 2010-2014 over Zanjan, Iran. Also using AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data, aerosol was classified by multiple clustering techniques. Both fine and coarse modes particles were seen in seasonal averaged of Aerosol Volume Size Distribution (AVSD). Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) variations indicate the presence of scattering aerosol like dust in the spring, summer and fall, and dominance of absorbing type aerosols in the winter. The maximum value of the phase function was observed in the summer and in small scattering angle which can be due to presence of coarse mode dust particles. The scatter plot of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) versus Angstrom Exponent (AE) is one of the most effective methods to find aerosol types. Extinction Angstrom exponent (EAE) versus SSA and EAE versus absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) are other ways to classification of aerosol types. Graphs show abundance of dust in the spring, summer and fall in Zanjan's atmosphere. Also presence of urban/industrial aerosols is in all seasons, especially in the fall and winter. In addition mixed aerosols exist in all seasons. On the other hand, no biomass burning aerosols found in Zanjan's atmosphere. © 2019 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,No,No,No
Approaches for identifying PM2.5 source types and source areas at a remote background site of South China in spring,"The receptor model is an effectively and widely used tool for analyzing the source of PM2.5, and its development and improvement have always been focused and challenged. In this study, approaches of source analysis is applied and compared. The PM2.5 samples were collected in spring of 2015 at a remote background site of Weizhou, South China and were analyzed for water-soluble ions, trace metals, and sugars. The 28 measurement species were introduced into the positive matrix factorization (PMF) and a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model for inter-comparison of PM2.5 prediction. Results showed that the NMF model is a more robust tool to identify source types and source apportionment in the case of a small sample size (n = 31). In NMF, four source variants were obtained as dust (15.6%), biomass combustion (11.8%), secondary formation (17.6%), and coal combustion (54.9%), corresponding to four main source areas. These were Southeast Asia, South China Sea, Taiwan Strait, as well as Pearl River Delta, respectively. The areas were distinguished based on hybrid receptor models, potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT), by introducing the daily loadings of each source factor from NMF method. These model results were highly consistent with categorized chemical characteristics of PM2.5, suggesting that NMF linking with hybrid receptor models provides valuable implications for exploring source types and source areas of PM2.5. Meanwhile, biomass combustion and coal combustion comparably contributed to the high PM2.5 concentrations indicating control strategy in South China in spring. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,No,No,No
Source apportionment for online dataset at a megacity in China using a new PTT-PMF model,"Air pollution negatively impact human health and the environment. Source apportionment is an important research method for designing effective air pollution control policies. In this study, a new PTT-PMF (Partial Target Transformation-Positive matrix factor) source apportionment method (based on Multilinear Engine 2 program) was developed, to better recognize the extracted source categories, for online dataset. By incorporating measured source profiles, this model can automatically extract factors that have physical significance and close to actual source profiles. The accuracy of the PTT-PMF method was first evaluated by using several artificial datasets, and the results were favorable. Results of the new model can better explain similar sources such as dust and coal combustion (when lack of markers such as Ai and Si), comparing with the base run obtained using PMF. Then, this model was applied to online measurement data collected in Tianjin, China. Six factors were obtained and they were close to actual source profiles: dust (6.06%), coal combustion (4.70%), secondary sulfate sources (26.36%), secondary nitrate sources (42.91%), vehicle exhaust (9.97%) and biomass burning & SOC (10.01%). Time series of source contributions can also help to identify the source categories. The work presented here may advance receptor modelling techniques and could also enhance the validity of source apportionment results. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Predicting Secondary Organic Aerosol Enhancement in the Presence of Atmospherically Relevant Organic Particles,"Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) produced from atmospheric oxidation of organic vapors comprises a large portion of ambient particulate matter. Currently, SOA models typically assume that all organic species form a well-mixed phase as a simplification, which follows that SOA formation is enhanced in the presence of pre-existing organic aerosol (OA) according to Raoult's Law. In this work, we show through experiments with atmospherically relevant OA that not all organic species are equally miscible, and the thermodynamics of mixing are composition dependent. SOA formation from α-pinene ozonolysis was investigated in the presence of OA that was collected from Toronto ambient air and other sources including biomass burning, meat-cooking emissions, and diesel exhaust. Compared to experiments with ammonium sulfate seed particles, enhanced SOA yields were observed with particles from biomass burning and meat cooking but not with diesel exhaust and concentrated ambient particles. We demonstrate that both kinetic (bulk diffusion-limitation) and thermodynamic (miscibility-limitation) factors are important in determining atmospheric organic aerosol partitioning. We develop parametrization methods using bulk elemental ratios (H/C and O/C) and functional group abundance (ROHand RCOOH) to estimate average intermolecular interactions, which allow us to use Hansen Solubility Framework we had previously developed to predict atmospheric organic aerosol miscibility and SOA yield enhancements in these complex mixtures. The framework has also been utilized to better understand the liquid-liquid phase separation between organic aerosol and inorganic salts. Our results show that a molecular description of thermodynamic forces is needed to describe aerosol mixing in the atmosphere and accurately parametrize SOA formation. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,No,No,No
Influence of the vapor wall loss on the degradation rate constants in chamber experiments of levoglucosan and other biomass burning markers,"Vapor wall loss has only recently been shown a potentially significant bias in atmospheric chamber studies. Yet, previous works aiming at the determination of the degradation rate of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) often did not account for this process. Here, we evaluate the influence of vapor wall loss on the determination of the gas-phase reaction rate kOH of several biomass burning markers (levoglucosan, mannosan, coniferyl aldehyde, 3-guaiacyl propanol, and acetosyringone) with hydroxyl radicals (OH). Emissions from the combustion of beech wood were injected into a 5.5m3 Teflon atmospheric chamber, and aged for 4h (equivalent to 5-8h in the atmosphere). The particle-phase compound concentrations were monitored using a thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatograph coupled to a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (TAG-AMS). The observed depletion of the concentration was later modeled using two different approaches: The previously published approach which does not take into consideration partitioning and vapor wall loss, and an approach with a more complex theoretical framework which integrates all the processes likely influencing the particle-phase concentration. We find that with the first approach one fails to predict the measured markers' concentration time evolution. With the second approach, we determine that partitioning and vapor wall loss play a predominant role in the particle-phase concentration depletion of all the compounds, while the reactivity with OH has a non-significative effect. Furthermore, we show that kOH cannot be determined precisely without a strong constraint of the whole set of physical parameters necessary to formally describe the various processes involved. It was found that the knowledge of the saturation mass concentration C∗ is especially crucial. Therefore, previously published rate constants of levoglucosan and more generally SVOCs with hydroxyl radicals inferred from atmospheric chamber experiments must be, at least, considered with caution. © Author(s) 2018.",,No,No,No
Satellite-based identification of aerosol particle species using a 2D-space aerosol classification model,"The classification of aerosol types using remote sensing tools is crucial for improving our knowledge on the impacts of aerosol species on global and regional climate. Ground-based classification methods have proven useful though they are limited by discontinuous spatial observations of aerosol optical properties. As such, there is a need to develop methods in aerosol species identification using satellite data. In this study, a 2D-space model suitable for MODIS AOD bands is developed to distinguish aerosol particle species based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol relative optical depth (AROD). The model can be used to classify five aerosol types, including biomass burning (BB: AOD470 ≥ 0.45, AROD660/470 < 0.58), urban industry (UI: AOD470 ≥ 0.45, 0.68 > AROD660/470 ≥ 0.58), sub-continental (SB: AOD470 ≥ 0.45, 0.91 > AROD660/470 ≥ 0.68), desert dust (DD: AROD660/470 ≥ 0.91) and continental (CO: AOD470 < 0.45, AROD660/470 < 0.91). AROD values corresponding to different types of aerosols are calculated through Mie scattering theory using the aerosol particle size distribution parameters and spectral complex refractive index. The accuracy and applicability of the model are verified in three steps: 1) we compare aerosol discrimination results of model with ground-based data and the local atmospheric conditions over different regions, 2) we compare aerosol identification results from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD retrieval and ground-based data, and 3) we test our model to validate its use in individual cases studies and regional observations. Our results demonstrate that aerosol species classification for each study region is consistent with the characteristics of their atmospheric conditions, and the classification results using MODIS AOD retrieval are similar to the ground-based observation results. The differences in MODIS versus AERONET AOD, caused by MODIS observation errors, is the major contributor to the differences between ground-based and satellite-based recognition results. Our three-steps validation results indicate that the 2D-space model developed in this paper can accurately identify different types of aerosols and has strong applicability. This provides a basis for the use of satellite data for continuous spatial identification of aerosol type, which greatly promotes research in related fields. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
The role of aerosol layer height in quantifying aerosol absorption from ultraviolet satellite observations,"The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the role of aerosol layer height (ALH) in quantifying the single scattering albedo (SSA) from ultraviolet satellite observations for biomass burning aerosols. In the first experiment, we retrieve SSA by minimizing the near-ultraviolet (near-UV) absorbing aerosol index (UVAI) difference between observed values and those simulated by a radiative transfer model. With the recently released S-5P TROPOMI ALH product constraining forward simulations, a significant gap in the retrieved SSA (0.25) is found between radiative transfer simulations with spectral flat aerosols and those with strong spectrally dependent aerosols, implying that inappropriate assumptions regarding aerosol absorption spectral dependence may cause severe misinterpretations of the aerosol absorption. In the second part of this paper, we propose an alternative method to retrieve SSA based on a long-term record of co-located satellite and ground-based measurements using the support vector regression (SVR) approach. This empirical method is free from the uncertainties due to the imperfection of a priori assumptions on aerosol microphysics seen in the first experiment. We present the potential capabilities of SVR using several fire events that have occurred in recent years. For all cases, the difference between SVR-retrieved SSA and AERONET are generally within ±0:05, and over half of the samples are within ±0:03. The results are encouraging, although in the current phase the model tends to overestimate the SSA for relatively absorbing cases and fails to predict SSA for some extreme situations. The spatial contrast in SSA retrieved by radiative transfer simulations is significantly higher than that retrieved by SVR, and the latter better agrees with SSA from MERRA-2 reanalysis. In the future, more sophisticated feature selection procedures and kernel functions should be taken into consideration to improve the SVR model accuracy. Moreover, the high-resolution TROPOMI UVAI and co-located ALH products will guide us to more reliable training data sets and more powerful algorithms to quantify aerosol absorption from UVAI records. © Author(s) 2019.",,No,No,No
Aerosol optical properties over an urban site in central China determined using ground-based sun photometer measurements," Sun photometer measurements taken in urban Jiaozuo in central China from July 2016 to February 2018 were used to investigate the aerosol optical and microphysical properties, including the climatological variation in properties, the types of aerosols and the properties during haze and dust events. The mean annual aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD                             440 nm                             ) and the Ångström exponent (AE                             440-870 nm                             ) were 0.84 ± 0.55 and 1.12 ± 0.17, respectively. The highest AOD occurred in summer, which may be associated with the hygroscopic growth of aerosols during enhanced relative humidity. Accordingly, a high volume of fine-mode particles was observed during this season. In addition, carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning increased the volume of fine particles in June and September, but coarse-mode particles (mainly dust) dominated during spring, especially in May, with a maximum volume of 0.16 µm                             3                              µm                             –2                             . At 440 nm, the mean seasonal single scattering albedo (SSA                             440 nm                             ) was lower in spring (0.87 ± 0.05) and higher in summer (0.95 ± 0.04), whereas the absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD                             440 nm                             ) displayed the opposite pattern, being higher in spring (0.079 ± 0.019) and lower in summer (0.045 ± 0.021). The increased absorptivity in spring and the strong scattering ability in summer of aerosols in this area may be related to particles originating from different sources. Using the method of classification based on the fine-mode fraction (FMF), SSA and AE, absorbing aerosols, both fine and mixed, were identified as the predominant type of particulate matter. The site was influenced not only by anthropogenic aerosols from local emissions and the surrounding regions but also by dust from northwestern China. The mean AOD and AE were 1.66 and 1.38 on hazy days, while a slightly low AOD of 0.95 and an extremely low AE of 0.18 were exhibited on dusty days. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of aerosol properties in this area, and the results will help to optimize the satellite aerosol inversion algorithm and promote regional climate change research.                          © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.",,No,No,No
Source apportionment of circum-Arctic atmospheric black carbon from isotopes and modeling,"Black carbon (BC) contributes to Arctic climate warming, yet source attributions are inaccurate due to lacking observational constraints and uncertainties in emission inventories. Year-round, isotope-constrained observations reveal strong seasonal variations in BC sources with a consistent and synchronous pattern at all Arctic sites. These sources were dominated by emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the winter and by biomass burning in the summer. The annual mean source of BC to the circum-Arctic was 39 ± 10% from biomass burning. Comparison of transport-model predictions with the observations showed good agreement for BC concentrations, with larger discrepancies for (fossil/biomass burning) sources. The accuracy of simulated BC concentration, but not of origin, points to misallocations of emissions in the emission inventories. The consistency in seasonal source contributions of BC throughout the Arctic provides strong justification for targeted emission reductions to limit the impact of BC on climate warming in the Arctic and beyond.

Infrared-absorbing carbonaceous tar can dominate light absorption by marine-engine exhaust,"Ship engines in the open ocean and Arctic typically combust heavy fuel oil (HFO), resulting in light-absorbing particulate matter (PM) emissions that have been attributed to black carbon (BC) and conventional, soluble brown carbon (brC). We show here that neither BC nor soluble brC is the major light-absorbing carbon (LAC) species in HFO-combustion PM. Instead, “tar brC” dominates. This tar brC, previously identified only in open-biomass-burning emissions, shares key defining properties with BC: it is insoluble, refractory, and substantially absorbs visible and near-infrared light. Relative to BC, tar brC has a higher Angstrom absorption exponent (AAE) (2.5–6, depending on the considered wavelengths), a moderately-high mass absorption efficiency (up to 50% of that of BC), and a lower ratio of sp2- to sp3-bonded carbon. Based on our results, we present a refined classification of atmospheric LAC into two sub-types of BC and two sub-types of brC. We apply this refined classification to demonstrate that common analytical techniques for BC must be interpreted with care when applied to tar-containing aerosols. The global significance of our results is indicated by field observations which suggest that tar brC already contributes to Arctic snow darkening, an effect which may be magnified over upcoming decades as Arctic shipping continues to intensify. © 2019, Crown.",,No,No,No
"The role of biomass burning agricultural emissions in the Indo-Gangetic Plains on the air quality in New Delhi, India","Agricultural residue burning in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) releases large amounts of reactive nitrogen, among other pollutants, into the atmosphere each year. This study focuses on rice paddy residue burning and wheat residue burning during October–November and April–May, respectively, in 2016 and 2017. Emissions of reactive nitrogen species (ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx = NO + NO2)) were estimated for the study period using a suite of satellite products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aqua and Terra satellites. Emissions were compared against ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in New Delhi, India, to help determine the impact that these agricultural burns have on PM2.5, which is known to have numerous health and environmental impacts associated with prolonged exposure to elevated concentrations. Daily average measured concentrations of PM2.5 in New Delhi range from 22.43 μg m−3 to 718.94 μg m−3 (average 127.15 μg m−3 ± 95.23 μg m−3), with the daily average PM2.5 concentration exceeding the national ambient air quality standard of 60 μg m−3 approximately 75% of the time. Concentrations of PM2.5 were found to peak during October–November, which corresponds with rice paddy residue burning in the IGP. In addition to this, statistical regression models were created to predict average daily PM2.5 concentrations in New Delhi, India, based on emissions of NH3 and organic carbon (OC) in the IGP as well as meteorological conditions. The regression model predicted ambient PM2.5 concentrations ranging from 35 to 719 μg m−3. The average modeled concentrations of PM2.5 in New Delhi, India, were 111 μg m−3 (standard deviation: ± 23 μg m−3) during April/May and 207 ± 87 μg m−3 during October/November. Both regression models (for wheat residue burning and for rice paddy residue burning) were comparable to the average observations (normalized mean bias less than 0.1%). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Building a cloud in the southeast Atlantic: Understanding low-cloud controls based on satellite observations with machine learning,"Understanding the processes that determine low-cloud properties and aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs) is crucial for the estimation of their radiative effects. However, the covariation of meteorology and aerosols complicates the determination of cloud-relevant influences and the quantification of the aerosol-cloud relation. This study identifies and analyzes sensitivities of cloud fraction and cloud droplet effective radius to their meteorological and aerosol environment in the atmospherically stable southeast Atlantic during the biomass-burning season based on an 8-day-averaged data set. The effect of geophysical parameters on clouds is investigated based on a machine learning technique, gradient boosting regression trees (GBRTs), using a combination of satellite and reanalysis data as well as trajectory modeling of air-mass origins. A comprehensive, multivariate analysis of important drivers of cloud occurrence and properties is performed and evaluated. The statistical model reveals marked subregional differences of relevant drivers and processes determining low clouds in the southeast Atlantic. Cloud fraction is sensitive to changes of lower tropospheric stability in the oceanic, southwestern subregion, while in the northeastern subregion it is governed mostly by surface winds. In the pristine, oceanic subregion large-scale dynamics and aerosols seem to be more important for changes of cloud droplet effective radius than in the polluted, near-shore subregion, where free tropospheric temperature is more relevant. This study suggests the necessity to consider distinct ACI regimes in cloud studies in the southeast Atlantic. © Author(s) 2018.",,No,No,No

The high abundance of aerosol particles in regions dominated by anthropogenic fossil fuel combustion, e.g. megacities, and/or biomass-burning episodes, affects the space-borne spectral measurement. Minimizing the tropospheric NO                             2                              VCD biases caused by aerosol scattering and absorption effects is one of the main retrieval challenges from air quality satellite instruments. In this study, the reference Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) DOMINO-v2 product was reprocessed over cloud-free scenes, by applying new aerosol correction parameters retrieved from the 477 nm O                             2                             -O                             2                              band, over eastern China and South America for 2 years (2006 2007). These new parameters are based on two different and separate algorithms developed during the last 2 years in view of an improved use of the OMI 477 nm O                             2                             -O                             2                              band: 1. the updated OMCLDO2 algorithm, which derives improved effective cloud parameters, 2. the aerosol neural network (NN), which retrieves explicit aerosol parameters by assuming a more physical aerosol model. The OMI aerosol NN is a step ahead of OMCLDO2 because it primarily estimates an explicit aerosol layer height (ALH), and secondly an aerosol optical thickness τ for cloud-free observations. Overall, it was found that all the considered aerosol correction parameters reduce the biases identified in DOMINO-v2 over scenes in China with high aerosol abundance dominated by fine scattering and weakly absorbing particles, e.g. from [-20% V -40%] to [0% V 20%] in summertime. The use of the retrieved OMI aerosol parameters leads in general to a more explicit aerosol correction and higher tropospheric NO                             2                              VCD values, in the range of [0% V 40%], than from the implicit correction with the updated OMCLDO2. This number overall represents an estimation of the aerosol correction strategy uncertainty nowadays for tropospheric NO                             2                              VCD retrieval from space-borne visible measurements. The explicit aerosol correction theoretically includes a more realistic consideration of aerosol multiple scattering and absorption effects, especially over scenes dominated by strongly absorbing particles, where the correction based on OMCLDO2 seems to remain insufficient. However, the use of ALH and τ from the OMI NN aerosol algorithm is not a straightforward operation and future studies are required to identify the optimal methodology. For that purpose, several elements are recommended in this paper. Overall, we demonstrate the possibility of applying a more explicit aerosol correction by considering aerosol parameters directly derived from the 477 nm O                             2                             -O                             2                              spectral band, measured by the same satellite instrument. Such an approach can, in theory, easily be transposed to the new-generation of space-borne instruments (e.g. TROPOMI on board Sentinel- 5 Precursor), enabling a fast reprocessing of tropospheric NO                             2                              data over cloud-free scenes (cloudy pixels need to be filtered out), as well as for other trace gas retrievals (e.g. SO                             2                             , HCHO).                          © 2019 Author(s).",,No,No,No
Links Between Carbon Monoxide and Climate Indices for the Southern Hemisphere and Tropical Fire Regions,"In the Southern Hemisphere and tropics, the main contribution to carbon monoxide (CO) variability is from fire emissions, which are connected to climate through the availability, type, and dryness of fuel. Here we assess the data-driven relationships between CO and climate, aiming to predict atmospheric loading during fire seasons. Observations of total column CO from the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere satellite instrument are used to build a record of monthly anomalies between 2001 and 2016, focusing on seven biomass burning regions of the Southern Hemisphere and tropics. With the exception of 2015, the range of absolute variability in CO is similar between regions. We model CO anomalies in each of the regions using climate indices for the climate modes: El Niño–Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, Tropical South Atlantic, and Antarctic Oscillation. Stepwise forward and backward variable selection is used to choose from statistical regression models that use combinations of climate indices, at lag times between 1 and 8 months relative to CO anomalies. The Bayesian information criterion selects models with the best predictive power. We find that all climate mode indices are required to model CO in each region, generally explaining over 50% of the variability and over 70% for tropical regions. First-order interaction terms of the climate modes are necessary, producing greatly improved explanation of CO variability over single terms. Predictive capability is assessed for the Maritime Southeast Asia and the predicted peak CO anomaly in 2015 is within 20% of the measurements. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

Exposure assessment of pulmonary functions of school going children due to agriculture crop residue burning practice in Indo-Gangetic plains of India,"Agriculture crop residue burning is a serious issue in Northern India due to ineffective control policies. An epidemiological study has been done on school going children to evaluate the trends in their physiological parameters due to crop residue burning activity in the affected area. Total 600 children were recruited and continuously inspected for three years at three different sites. Season wise, the level of fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) was higher in rice crop residue burning seasons than in wheat crop residue burning seasons. As per dose–response relationship, maximum degradation was observed in FVC (−7.62%) and PEF (−6.23%) parameters from their baseline values due to burning activities. With adjustment of socioeconomic, anthropometric parameters of selected subjects and meteorological parameters in multivariate mixed effect model, prediction equations have been purposed to observe the future trends in physiological parameters of children. Based on Tiffenue index, an unrecoverable effect has been observed in lung parameters. Trends were alarming and may cause serious complications in early age of human subjects. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,No,No,No
"Concentration level, distribution model, source analysis, and ecological risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sediments from laizhou bay, China","To master the distribution patterns and environmental risk of 16 USEPA preferential polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments from Laizhou Bay, 20 samples were collected and investigated in this survey. The average PAH concentration in these sediments ranged from 268.97 ng/g to 895.37 ng/g with an average of 612.52 ng/g, thereby suggesting a relatively low PAH pollution in Laizhou Bay compared with other bays in the world. Tricyclic PAHs account for 79% of the total PAH content and were eventually identified as the most crucial component of these sediments. The PCA–MLR results identify fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning, and coke oven as the main sources of PAHs that account for 26.69%, 67.16%, and 6.15% of the total PAH concentration in the collected sediments, respectively. The effect range low/effect range median (ERL/ERM) reveal the low toxicity of PAHs in these sediments. However, the concentration of Fle at each survey site exceeds the ERL level. Meanwhile, the mean effects range–median quotient (M-ERM-Q) indicates the low level of ecological risk of PAHs in the surface sediments from Laizhou Bay. However, the contingency risk of Fle and Phe cannot be ruled out. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Analysis fire patterns and drivers with a global SEVER-FIRE v1.0 model incorporated into dynamic global vegetation model and satellite and on-ground observations,"                             Biomass burning is an important environmental process with a strong influence on vegetation and on the atmospheric composition. It competes with microbes and herbivores to convert biomass to CO                             2                              and it is a major contributor of gases and aerosols to the atmosphere. To better understand and predict global fire occurrence, fire models have been developed and coupled to dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and Earth system models (ESMs). We present SEVER-FIRE v1.0 (Socio-Economic and natural Vegetation ExpeRimental global fire model version 1.0), which is incorporated into the SEVER DGVM. One of the major focuses of SEVER-FIRE is an implementation of pyrogenic behavior of humans (timing of their activities and their willingness and necessity to ignite or suppress fire), related to socioeconomic and demographic conditions in a geographical domain of the model application. Burned areas and emissions from the SEVER model are compared to the Global Fire Emission Database version 2 (GFED), derived from satellite observations, while number of fires is compared with regional historical fire statistics. We focus on both the model output accuracy and its assumptions regarding fire drivers and perform (1) an evaluation of the predicted spatial and temporal patterns, focusing on fire incidence, seasonality and interannual variability; (2) analysis to evaluate the assumptions concerning the etiology, or causation, of fire, including climatic and anthropogenic drivers, as well as the type and amount of vegetation. SEVER reproduces the main features of climate-driven interannual fire variability at a regional scale, for example the large fires associated with the 1997-1998 El Niño event in Indonesia and Central and South America, which had critical ecological and atmospheric impacts. Spatial and seasonal patterns of fire incidence reveal some model inaccuracies, and we discuss the implications of the distribution of vegetation types inferred by the DGVM and of assumed proxies of human fire practices. We further suggest possible development directions to enable such models to better project future fire activity.                          © 2019 Author(s).",,No,No,No
Amazonian Biomass Burning Enhances Tropical Andean Glaciers Melting,"The melting of tropical glaciers provides water resources to millions of people, involving social, ecological and economic demands. At present, these water reservoirs are threatened by the accelerating rates of mass loss associated with modern climate changes related to greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately land use/cover change. Until now, the effects of land use/cover change on the tropical Andean glaciers of South America through biomass burning activities have not been investigated. In this study, we quantitatively examine the hypothesis that regional land use/cover change is a contributor to the observed glacier mass loss, taking into account the role of Amazonian biomass burning. We demonstrated here, for the first time, that for tropical Andean glaciers, a massive contribution of black carbon emitted from biomass burning in the Amazon Basin does exist. This is favorable due to its positioning with respect to Amazon Basin fire hot spots and the predominant wind direction during the transition from the dry to wet seasons (Aug-Sep-Oct), when most fire events occur. We investigated changes in Bolivian Zongo Glacier albedo due to impurities on snow, including black carbon surface deposition and its potential for increasing annual glacier melting. We showed that the magnitude of the impact of Amazonian biomass burning depends on the dust content in snow. When high concentration of dust is present (e.g. 100 ppm of dust), the dust absorbs most of the radiation that otherwise would be absorbed by the BC. Our estimations point to a melting factor of 3.3 ± 0.8% for black carbon, and 5.0 ± 1.0% for black carbon in the presence of low dust content (e.g. 10 ppm of dust). For the 2010 hydrological year, we reported an increase in runoff corresponding to 4.5% of the annual discharge during the seasonal peak fire season, which is consistent with our predictions. © 2019, The Author(s).",,No,No,No
Monitoring the spatio-temporal aerosol loading over Nigeria,"The moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS, Terra and Aqua) and ozone monitoring instruments (OMI) were used to investigate the spatio-temporal variations of aerosols over Nigeria. The cloud aerosol lidar and Infared Pathfinder satelite observations (CALIPSO) were used for cloud aerosol classification in order to show aerosol concentration within the planetary boundary layer (PBL). 4 years data were selected so as to be able to observe seasonal variation on the aerosol loading and to identify the year(s) and month(s) that experienced highest aerosol plume. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) of 2.30 µg/m3 occurred in March, 2012 at the shoreline of South–South, Nigeria while 1.25 µg/m3 was recorded in June, 2011 in Plateau State, North-Central, Nigeria. Dominant aerosols found around the shore line of the country were rich in sulfate as it shows hygroscopic characteristics and exhibited seasonal variation for the 4 years experimented. It was observed that petroleum refinery operations and gas flaring significantly contributes to the major sources of sulfate aerosol which would likely increase aerosol optical depth over the region. Strong outbreak of dust experienced over Nigeria from 500 to 1500 m originated from the continental sources in the Saharan desert, Mediterranean sea and other biomass burning in the Niger Delta. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,No,No,No
Spaceborne Measurements of Formic and Acetic Acids: A Global View of the Regional Sources,"Formic (HCOOH) and acetic acids (CH3COOH) are the most abundant carboxylic acids in the Earth's atmosphere and key compounds to aqueous-phase chemistry. Here we present the first distributions of CH3COOH retrieved from the 2007–2018 satellite observations of the nadir-looking infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI), using a neural network-based retrieval approach. A joint analysis with the IASI HCOOH product reveals that the two species exhibit similar distributions, seasonality, and atmospheric burden, pointing to major common sources. We show that their abundance is highly correlated to isoprene and monoterpenes emissions, as well as to biomass burning. Over Africa, evidence is provided that residual smoldering combustion might be a major driver of the HCOOH and CH3COOH seasonality. Earlier seasonal enhancement of HCOOH at Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes and late seasonal secondary peaks of CH3COOH in the tropics suggest that sources and production pathways specific to each species are also at play. ©2020.

Overview paper: New insights into aerosol and climate in the Arctic,"Motivated by the need to predict how the Arctic atmosphere will change in a warming world, this article summarizes recent advances made by the research consortium NETCARE (Network on Climate and Aerosols: Addressing Key Uncertainties in Remote Canadian Environments) that contribute to our fundamental understanding of Arctic aerosol particles as they relate to climate forcing. The overall goal of NETCARE research has been to use an interdisciplinary approach encompassing extensive field observations and a range of chemical transport, earth system, and biogeochemical models. Several major findings and advances have emerged from NETCARE since its formation in 2013. (1) Unexpectedly high summertime dimethyl sulfide (DMS) levels were identified in ocean water (up to 75&thinsp;nM) and the overlying atmosphere (up to 1&thinsp;ppbv) in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA). Furthermore, melt ponds, which are widely prevalent, were identified as an important DMS source (with DMS concentrations of up to 6&thinsp;nM and a potential contribution to atmospheric DMS of 20&thinsp;% in the study area). (2) Evidence of widespread particle nucleation and growth in the marine boundary layer was found in the CAA in the summertime, with these events observed on 41&thinsp;% of days in a 2016 cruise. As well, at Alert, Nunavut, particles that are newly formed and grown under conditions of minimal anthropogenic influence during the months of July and August are estimated to contribute 20&thinsp;% to 80&thinsp;% of the 30-50&thinsp;nm particle number density. DMS-oxidation-driven nucleation is facilitated by the presence of atmospheric ammonia arising from seabird-colony emissions, and potentially also from coastal regions, tundra, and biomass burning. Via accumulation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), a significant fraction of the new particles grow to sizes that are active in cloud droplet formation. Although the gaseous precursors to Arctic marine SOA remain poorly defined, the measured levels of common continental SOA precursors (isoprene and monoterpenes) were low, whereas elevated mixing ratios of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) were inferred to arise via processes involving the sea surface microlayer. (3) The variability in the vertical distribution of black carbon (BC) under both springtime Arctic haze and more pristine summertime aerosol conditions was observed. Measured particle size distributions and mixing states were used to constrain, for the first time, calculations of aerosol-climate interactions under Arctic conditions. Aircraft- and ground-based measurements were used to better establish the BC source regions that supply the Arctic via long-range transport mechanisms, with evidence for a dominant springtime contribution from eastern and southern Asia to the middle troposphere, and a major contribution from northern Asia to the surface. (4) Measurements of ice nucleating particles (INPs) in the Arctic indicate that a major source of these particles is mineral dust, likely derived from local sources in the summer and long-range transport in the spring. In addition, INPs are abundant in the sea surface microlayer in the Arctic, and possibly play a role in ice nucleation in the atmosphere when mineral dust concentrations are low. (5) Amongst multiple aerosol components, BC was observed to have the smallest effective deposition velocities to high Arctic snow (0.03 cm s1). © 2019.

Assessment of Agricultural Practices from Sentinel 1 and 2 Images Applied on Rice Fields to Get A Farm Typology in the Camargue Region,"In the global change context, an efficient management of the available resources has become one of the most important topic particularly for sustainable crop development. Many questions concern the evolution of the rice farming systems in Camargue, in the Southeastern France, which play a crucial role to control the soil salinity and whose the surfaces significantly decreased these last years from 20 000 ha in 2010 to around 14000 ha in 2014. The arrival of the new satellites Sentinel makes it possible to evaluate these crop evolutions. The objectives of this study were to propose operational methodologies to: 1) accurately assess the surfaces of the main crops, rice, wheat and grassland in 2016 and 2017 from classifications based on multispectral data, (2) map some agricultural practices (sowing and harvest residue burning), and (3) elaborate a farm typology for the Camargue region based on variables computed from remote sensing data to better understand the farmer strategies. © 2019 IEEE.",,No,No,No
"A decade of aerosol optical properties measurements over athens, Greece","Long-term ground-based measurements of aerosol optical properties in Athens, Greece, for the period 2008-2018 performed by the National Observatory of Athens are used in order to investigate the aerosol climatology of the area. In this study, we utilize quality-assured measurements of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) and Angstrom exponent obtained by CIMEL photometers in the framework of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) to extract the seasonality and the trends of aerosols in the region. Higher aerosol loads are found during spring and summer months. A 1.1% per year decrease for AOD at 440 nm and 0.4% decrease per year for SSA during the studied period are recorded. Collocated and synchronous PM10 values, for a five-year period, are used in order to study ground-level conditions. Also, the Planetary Boundary Layer Height from ERA-5 is used to investigate the stratification of the particles. The classification of aerosols using AERONET data is performed to separate dust, biomass burning, polluted urban, marine and continental dominant aerosol mixtures. Also, the characterization of AOD provided by Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) is investigated. Finally, seasonal AOD trends recorded from AERONET from satellite sensors (MODIS-Aqua/MODIS-Terra) and estimated by CAMS are examined, and significant differences have been found. © 2020 by the authors.",,No,No,No
Evaluating the diurnal cycle of South Atlantic stratocumulus clouds as observed by MSG SEVIRI,"Marine stratocumulus (Sc) clouds play an essential role in the earth radiation budget. Here, we compare liquid water path (LWP), cloud optical thickness, and cloud droplet effective radius (re) retrievals from 2 years of collocated Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) observations; estimate the effect of biomass burning smoke on passive imager retrievals; and evaluate the diurnal cycle of South Atlantic marine Sc clouds. The effect of absorbing aerosols from biomass burning on the retrievals was investigated using the aerosol index (AI) obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). SEVIRI and MODIS LWPs were found to decrease with increasing AI relative to TMI LWP, consistent with well-known negative visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) retrieval biases in and re. In the aerosol-affected months of July-August-September, SEVIRI LWP - based on the 1.6μm re - was biased low by 14m'2 (1/4 16%) compared to TMI in overcast scenes, while MODIS LWP showed a smaller low bias of 4m'2 (1/4 5%) for the 1.6μm channel and a high bias of 8m'2 (1/4 10%) for the 3.7μm channel compared to TMI. Neglecting aerosol-affected pixels reduced the mean SEVIRI-TMI LWP bias considerably. For 2 years of data, SEVIRI LWP had a correlation with TMI and MODIS LWP of about 0.86 and 0.94, respectively, and biases of only 4-8m'2 (5%-10%) for overcast cases. The SEVIRI LWP diurnal cycle was in good overall agreement with TMI except in the aerosol-affected months. Both TMI and SEVIRI LWP decreased from morning to late afternoon, after which a slow increase was observed. Terra and Aqua MODIS mean LWPs also suggested a similar diurnal variation. The relative amplitude of the 2-year-mean and seasonal-mean LWP diurnal cycle varied between 35% and 40% from morning to late afternoon for overcast cases. The diurnal variation in SEVIRI LWP was mainly due to changes in, while re showed only little diurnal variability. © Author(s) 2018.",,No,No,No
Regression analysis of aerosol optical properties with long-term MODIS data using forward selection method,"In this work, a new filtering method of forward selection (FS), has been employed for linear and multiple regression analysis of aerosol optical properties with meteorological parameters using long-term moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for New Delhi area. Long-term observation (15 years, March 2000–December 2014) of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm, fine mode fraction particles (FMF) and Angstrom exponent (AE) are analyzed to study their variability on annual and seasonal basis. The analysis reveals relatively high mean AOD (0.71 ± 0.25), associated with moderate AE (0.69 ± 0.13) for the overall period. Considerable higher values of AOD (0.89 ± 0.33) were reported in monsoon and AE (0.87 ± 0.10) during winter season. Likewise, seasonal fraction for AOD was also found to be higher (42%) during the monsoon season and for AE (31%) and for FMF (55%) during winter season. The peak value of AOD was during June–July and the lowest in the transitional months of February and September, while AE was high in January–February and low in May–June suggesting significant urban and biomass burning contribution. In general, the analysis shows a rather well-mixed type of aerosols present in the urban environment, which affect the regional air quality as well as climate associated with long-range transport of pollutants through the westerly winds from the Thar Desert and biomass burning in the western parts of India. The presence of AOD trend is evidence of air quality deterioration particularly in highly populated areas. The aerosol classification with relationship between AOD and alpha shows that urban/biomass burning aerosols are dominant in Delhi during winter and pre-monsoon. It is clearly seen that irrespective of constant emissions occurring each month, the estimated pollution is much higher in winter months and lower in summer months. It is concluded that fine particles exhibit much higher variations than urban aerosols annually and seasonally. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,No,No,No
Single-particle characterization of biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA): Evidence for non-uniform mixing of high molecular weight organics and potassium,"Biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) can be emitted from natural forest fires and human activities such as agricultural burning and domestic energy generation. BBOA is strongly associated with atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) that absorbs near-ultraviolet and visible light, resulting in significant impacts on regional visibility degradation and radiative forcing. The mixing state of BBOA can play a critical role in the prediction of aerosol optical properties. In this work, single-particle measurements from a Soot-Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer coupled with a light scattering module (LS-SP-AMS) were performed to examine the mixing state of BBOA, refractory black carbon (rBC), and potassium (K, a tracer for biomass burning aerosol) in an air mass influenced by wildfire emissions transported from northern Québec to Toronto, representing aged biomass burning plumes. Cluster analysis of single-particle measurements identified five BBOA-related particle types. rBC accounted for 3-14 wt% of these particle types on average. Only one particle type exhibited a strong ion signal for K+, with mass spectra characterized by low molecular weight organic species. The remaining four particle types were classified based on the apparent molecular weight of the BBOA constituents. Two particle types were associated with low potassium content and significant amounts of high molecular weight (HMW) organic compounds. Our observations indicate non-uniform mixing of particles within a biomass burning plume in terms of molecular weight and illustrate that HMW BBOA can be a key contributor to low-volatility BrC observed in BBOA particles. The average mass absorption efficiency of low-volatility BBOA is about 0.8-1.1 m2g-1 based on a theoretical closure calculation. Our estimates indicate that low-volatility BBOA contributes ∼ 33-44 % of thermo-processed particle absorption at 405nnm; and almost all of the BBOA absorption was associated with low-volatility organics. © 2016 Author(s).",,No,No,No
Investigating diesel engines as an atmospheric source of isocyanic acid in urban areas,"Isocyanic acid (HNCO), an acidic gas found in tobacco smoke, urban environments, and biomass-burning-affected regions, has been linked to adverse health outcomes. Gasoline- and diesel-powered engines and biomass burning are known to emit HNCO and hypothesized to emit precursors such as amides that can photochemically react to produce HNCO in the atmosphere. Increasingly, diesel engines in developed countries like the United States are required to use selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to reduce tailpipe emissions of oxides of nitrogen. SCR chemistry is known to produce HNCO as an intermediate product, and SCR systems have been implicated as an atmospheric source of HNCO. In this work, we measure HNCO emissions from an SCR system-equipped diesel engine and, in combination with earlier data, use a three-dimensional chemical transport model (CTM) to simulate the ambient concentrations and source/pathway contributions to HNCO in an urban environment. Engine tests were conducted at three different engine loads, using two different fuels and at multiple operating points. HNCO was measured using an acetate chemical ionization mass spectrometer. The diesel engine was found to emit primary HNCO (3-90mg-1) but we did not find any evidence that the SCR system or other aftertreatment devices (i.e., oxidation catalyst and particle filter) produced or enhanced HNCO emissions. The CTM predictions compared well with the only available observational datasets for HNCO in urban areas but underpredicted the contribution from secondary processes. The comparison implied that diesel-powered engines were the largest source of HNCO in urban areas. The CTM also predicted that daily-averaged concentrations of HNCO reached a maximum of 110pptv but were an order of magnitude lower than the 1ppbv level that could be associated with physiological effects in humans. Precursor contributions from other combustion sources (gasoline and biomass burning) and wintertime conditions could enhance HNCO concentrations but need to be explored in future work. © 2017 Author(s).",,No,No,No
Public perception of rural environmental quality: Moving towards a multi-pollutant approach,"Most environmental epidemiology studies have examined pollutants individually. Multi-pollutant approaches have been recognized recently, but to the extent of our knowledge, no study to date has specifically investigated exposures to multiple air pollutants in rural environments. In this paper we characterized and quantified residential exposures to air pollutant mixtures in rural populations, provided a better understanding of the relationships between air pollutant mixtures and annoyance responses to environmental stressors, particularly odor, and quantified their predictive abilities. We used validated and highly spatially resolved atmospheric modeling of 14 air pollutants for four rural areas of Denmark, and the annoyance responses considered were annoyance due to odor, noise, dust, smoke and vibrations. We found significant associations between odor annoyance and principal components predominantly described by nitrate (NO3−), ammonium (NH4+), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and NH3, which are usually related to agricultural emission sources. Among these components, NH3 showed the lowest error when comparing observed population data and predicted probabilities. The combination of these compounds in a predictive model resulted in the most accurate model, being able to correctly predict 66% of odor annoyance responses. Furthermore, noise annoyance was found to be significantly associated with traffic-related air pollutants. In general terms, our results suggest that emissions from the agricultural and livestock production sectors are the main contributors to environmental annoyance, but also identify traffic and biomass burning as potential sources of annoyance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Associations between source-specific fine particulate matter and emergency department visits for respiratory disease in four U.S. cities,"Background: Short-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Determining which sources of PM2.5 are most toxic can help guide targeted reduction of PM2.5. However, conducting multicity epidemio-logic studies of sources is difficult because source-specific PM2.5 is not directly measured, and source chemical compositions can vary between cities. oBjectives: We determined how the chemical composition of primary ambient PM2.5 sources varies across cities. We estimated associations between source-specific PM2.5 and respiratory disease emergency department (ED) visits and examined between-city heterogeneity in estimated associations. Methods: We used source apportionment to estimate daily concentrations of primary source-specific PM2.5 for four U.S. cities. For sources with similar chemical compositions between cities, we applied Poisson time-series regression models to estimate associations between source-specific PM2.5 and respiratory disease ED visits. results: We found that PM2.5 from biomass burning, diesel vehicle, gasoline vehicle, and dust sources was similar in chemical composition between cities, but PM2.5 from coal combustion and metal sources varied across cities. We found some evidence of positive associations of respiratory disease ED visits with biomass burning PM2.5; associations with diesel and gasoline PM2.5 were frequently imprecise or consistent with the null. We found little evidence of associations with dust PM2.5. conclusions: We introduced an approach for comparing the chemical compositions of PM2.5 sources across cities and conducted one of the first multicity studies of source-specific PM2.5 and ED visits. Across four U.S. cities, among the primary PM2.5 sources assessed, biomass burning PM2.5 was most strongly associated with respiratory health. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

On the vertical distribution of smoke in the Amazonian atmosphere during the dry season,"Lidar observations of smoke aerosols have been analysed from six flights of the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements BAe-146 research aircraft over Brazil during the biomass burning season (September 2012). A large aerosol optical depth (AOD) was observed, typically ranging 0.4-0.9, along with a typical aerosol extinction coefficient of 100-400 Mm-1. The data highlight the persistent and widespread nature of the Amazonian haze, which had a consistent vertical structure, observed over a large distance (∼2200 km) during a period of 14 days. Aerosols were found near the surface; but the larger aerosol load was typically found in elevated layers that extended from 1-1.5 to 4-6 km. The measurements have been compared to model predictions with the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) and the ECMWF-MACC model. The MetUM generally reproduced the vertical structure of the Amazonian haze observed with the lidar. The ECMWF-MACC model was also able to reproduce the general features of smoke plumes albeit with a small overestimation of the AOD. The models did not always capture localised features such as (i) smoke plumes originating from individual fires, and (ii) aerosols in the vicinity of clouds. In both these circumstances, peak extinction coefficients of the order of 1000-1500 Mm-1 and AODs as large as 1-1.8 were encountered, but these features were either underestimated or not captured in the model predictions. Smoke injection heights derived from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) for the region are compatible with the general height of the aerosol layers. © Author(s) 2016.",,No,No,No
Four-dimensional variational inversion of black carbon emissions during ARCTAS-CARB with WRFDA-Chem,"Biomass burning emissions of atmospheric aerosols, including black carbon, are growing due to increased global drought, and comprise a large source of uncertainty in regional climate and air quality studies. We develop and apply new incremental four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) capabilities in WRFDA-Chem to find optimal spatially and temporally distributed biomass burning (BB) and anthropogenic black carbon (BC) aerosol emissions. The constraints are provided by aircraft BC concentrations from the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites in collaboration with the California Air Resources Board (ARCTAS-CARB) field campaign and surface BC concentrations from the Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environment (IMPROVE) network on 22, 23, and 24 June 2008. We consider three BB inventories, including Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN) v1.0 and v1.5 and Quick Fire Emissions Database (QFED) v2.4r8. On 22 June, aircraft observations are able to reduce the spread between a customized QFED inventory and FINNv1.0 from a factor of 3. 5 ( × 3. 5) to only × 2. 1. On 23 and 24 June, the spread is reduced from × 3. 4 to × 1. 4. The posterior corrections to emissions are heterogeneous in time and space, and exhibit similar spatial patterns of sign for both inventories. The posterior diurnal BB patterns indicate that multiple daily emission peaks might be warranted in specific regions of California. The US EPA's 2005 National Emissions Inventory (NEI05) is used as the anthropogenic prior. On 23 and 24 June, the coastal California posterior is reduced by × 2, where highway sources dominate, while inland sources are increased near Barstow by × 5. Relative BB emission variances are reduced from the prior by up to 35 % in grid cells close to aircraft flight paths and by up to 60 % for fires near surface measurements. Anthropogenic variance reduction is as high as 40 % and is similarly limited to sources close to observations. We find that the 22 June aircraft observations are able to constrain approximately 14 degrees of freedom of signal (DOF), while surface and aircraft observations together on 23/24 June constrain 23 DOF. Improving hourly- to daily-scale concentration predictions of BC and other aerosols during BB events will require more comprehensive and/or targeted measurements and a more complete accounting of sources of error besides the emissions. © Author(s) 2017.",,No,No,No
CALIOP near-real-time backscatter products compared to EARLINET data,"The expedited near-real-time Level 1.5 Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) version 3 products were evaluated against data from the ground-based European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET). The statistical framework and results of the three-year evaluation of 48 CALIOP overpasses with ground tracks within a 100 km distance from operating EARLINET stations are presented and include analysis for the following CALIOP classifications of aerosol type: dust, polluted dust, clean marine, clean continental, polluted continental, mixed and/or smoke/biomass burning. For the complete data set comprising both the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the free troposphere (FT) data, the correlation coefficient (R) was 0.86. When the analysis was conducted separately for the PBL and FT, the correlation coefficients were R = 0.6 and R = 0.85, respectively. From analysis of selected specific cases, it was initially thought that the presence of FT layers, with high attenuated backscatter, led to poor agreement of the PBL backscatter profiles between the CALIOP and EARLINET and prompted a further analysis to filter out such cases; however, removal of these layers did not improve the agreement as R reduced marginally from R = 0.86 to R = 0.84 for the combined PBL and FT analysis, increased marginally from R = 0.6 up to R = 0.65 for the PBL on its own, and decreased marginally from R = 0.85 to R = 0.79 for the FT analysis on its own. This suggests considerable variability, across the data set, in the spatial distribution of the aerosol over spatial scales of 100 km or less around some EARLINET stations rather than influence from elevated FT layers.

Due to this, the study of optical properties of atmospheric aerosols over a mega city “New Delhi” which is highly polluted and populated were conducted for two years long to see the aerosol loading and its seasonal variability using sun/sky radiometer data. Relatively higher mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) (0.90 ± 0.38) at 500 nm and associated Angstrom exponent (AE) (0.82 ± 0.35) for a pair of wavelength 400–870 nm is observed during the study period indicating highly turbid atmosphere throughout the year. Maximum AOD value is observed in the months of June and November while minimum is in transition months March and September. Apart from this, highest value of AOD (AE) value is observed in the post-monsoon [1.00 ± 0.42 (1.02 ± 0.16)] season followed by the winter [0.95 ± 0.36 (1.02 ± 0.20)] attributed to significance contribution of urban as well as biomass/crop residue burning aerosol which is further confirmed by aerosol type discrimination based on AOD vs AE. During the pre-monsoon season, mostly dust and mixed types aerosols are dominated. AODs value at shorter wavelength observed maximum in June and November while at longer wavelength maximum AOD is observed in June only. For the better understanding of seasonal aerosol modification process, the aerosol curvature effect is studied which show a strong seasonal dependency under a high turbid atmosphere, which are mainly associated with various emission sources. Five days air mass back trajectories were computed. They suggest different patterns of particle transport during the different seasons. Results suggest that mixtures of aerosols are present in the urban environment, which affect the regional air quality as well as climate. The present study will be very much useful to the modeler for validation of satellite data with observed data during estimation of radiative effect. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,No,No,No
Simulating ozone concentrations using precursor emission inventories in Delhi – National Capital Region of India,"This study simulates ground level ozone concentrations in a heavily populated and polluted National Capital Region (NCR- Delhi) in India. Multi-sectoral emission inventories of ozone precursors are prepared at a high resolution of 4 × 4 km2 for the whole region covering the capital city of Delhi along with other surrounding towns and rural regions in NCR. Emission inventories show that transport sector accounts for 55% of the total NOx emissions, followed by power plants (23%) and diesel generator sets (7%). In NMVOC inventories, transport sector again accounts for 33%, followed by evaporative emissions released from solvent use and fuel handling activities (30%), and agricultural residue burning (28%). Refuse burning contributes to 73% of CO emissions mainly due to incomplete combustion, followed by agricultural residue burning (14%). These emissions are spatially and temporally distributed across the study domain and are fed into the WRF-CMAQ models to predict ozone concentrations for the year 2012. Model validations are carried out with the observed values at different monitoring stations in Delhi. The performance of the models over various metrics used for evaluation was found to be satisfactory. Summers and post-monsoon seasons were better simulated than monsoon and winter seasons. Simulations have shown higher concentrations of ozone formation during summers and lesser during winters and monsoon seasons, mainly due to varying solar radiation affecting photo-chemical activities. Ozone concentrations are observed lower at those locations where NOx emissions are higher, and concentrations increase close to the boundary of study domain when compared to the center of Delhi city. Downwind regions to Delhi are influenced by the ozone formed due to plume of precursor emissions released from Delhi. Considering significant background contributions, regional scale controls are required for reducing ozone in NCR. © 2016",,No,No,No
Model elucidating the sources and formation mechanisms of severe haze pollution over Northeast mega-city cluster in China,"Recent studies on regional haze pollution over China come up in general with strong variability of main causes of heavy polluted episodes, in linkage with local specificities, sources and pollution characteristics. This paper therefore aims at elucidating the main specific sources and formation mechanisms of observed strong haze pollution episodes over 1–15 November 2015 in Northeast region considered as one of biggest megacity clusters in China. The Northeast China mega-city cluster, including Heilong Jiang, Jilin and Liaoning provinces, is adjacent to Russia in the north, Mongolian at the west, North Korea at east, and representing key geographical location in the regional and transnational air pollution issues in China due to the presence of heavy industries and intense economic activities. The present study, based on air quality monitoring, remote sensing satellite data and sensitivity experiments carried on the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS), quantitatively assesses the impact of meteorological conditions and potential contributions from regional chemical transport, intensive energy combustion, illegal emission and biomass burning emissions to PM2.5 concentration variation. The results indicate strong inversion occurrence at lower atmosphere with weak near-surface wind speed and high relative humidity, leading to PM2.5 concentration increase of about 30–50%. Intensive energy combustion (plausibly for heating activities) and illegal emission also significantly enhance the overall PM2.5 accumulation by 100–200 μg m−3 (60–70% increase), against 75–100 μg m−3 from the biomass burning under the northeast-southwest transport pathway, corresponding to a contribution of 10–20% to PM2.5 concentration increase. Obviously, stagnant meteorological conditions, energy combustion, illegal emission and biomass burning are main drivers of strong haze formation and spatial distribution over Northeast China megacity cluster. In clear, much effort on emission abatement at both local and regional scales is still an urgent imperative to overcome current critical haze pollution. © 2017 The Authors",,No,No,No
Mapping exposure to particulate pollution during severe haze episode using improved MODIS AOT-PM10 regression model with synoptic meteorology classification,"Severe smoke haze from biomass burning is frequently observed in Northern Thailand during dry months of February–April. Sparsely located monitoring stations operated in this vast mountainous region could not provide sufficient particulate matter (PM) data for exposure risk assessment. Satellite aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data could be used, but their reliable relationship with ground-based PM data should be first established. This study aimed to improve the regression model between PM10 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AOT with consideration of synoptic patterns to better assess the exposure risk in the area. Among four synoptic patterns, each representing the totality of meteorology governing Northern Thailand on a given day, most severe haze days belonged to pattern 2 that featured conditions of clear sky, stagnant air, and high PM10 levels. AOT-24 h PM10 regression model for pattern 2 had coefficient of determination improved to 0.51 from 0.39 of combined case. Daily exposure maps to PM10 in most severe haze period of February–April 2007 were produced for Chiangmai, the largest and most populated province in Northern Thailand. Regression model for pattern 2 was used to convert 24 h PM10 ranges of modified risk scale to corresponding AOT ranges, and the mapping was done using spatially continuous AOT values. The highest exposure risk to PM10 was shown in urban populated areas. Larger numbers of forest fire hot spots and more calm winds were observed on the days of higher exposure risk. Early warning and adequate health care plan are necessary to reduce exposure risk to future haze episodes in the area. ©2017. The Authors.",,No,No,No
Spatial distribution analysis of the OMI aerosol layer height: A pixel-by-pixel comparison to CALIOP observations,"A global picture of atmospheric aerosol vertical distribution with a high temporal resolution is of key importance not only for climate, cloud formation, and air quality research studies but also for correcting scattered radiation induced by aerosols in absorbing trace gas retrievals from passive satellite sensors. Aerosol layer height (ALH) was retrieved from the OMI 477ĝ€nm O2 ĝ' O2 band and its spatial pattern evaluated over selected cloud-free scenes. Such retrievals benefit from a synergy with MODIS data to provide complementary information on aerosols and cloudy pixels. We used a neural network approach previously trained and developed. Comparison with CALIOP aerosol level 2 products over urban and industrial pollution in eastern China shows consistent spatial patterns with an uncertainty in the range of 462-648ĝ€m. In addition, we show the possibility to determine the height of thick aerosol layers released by intensive biomass burning events in South America and Russia from OMI visible measurements. A Saharan dust outbreak over sea is finally discussed. Complementary detailed analyses show that the assumed aerosol properties in the forward modelling are the key factors affecting the accuracy of the results, together with potential cloud residuals in the observation pixels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the physical meaning of the retrieved ALH scalar corresponds to the weighted average of the vertical aerosol extinction profile. These encouraging findings strongly suggest the potential of the OMI ALH product, and in more general the use of the 477ĝ€nm O2 ĝ' O2 band from present and future similar satellite sensors, for climate studies as well as for future aerosol correction in air quality trace gas retrievals. © Author(s) 2018.",,No,No,No
Weed Seed Wizard: A tool that demonstrates the value of integrated weed management tactics such as harvest weed seed destruction,"Harvest weed seed destruction (HWSD) can be included in an integrated weed management (IWM) program to help control weed populations and combat herbicide resistance. However, it may not be possible or practical to use this technique in every year. This research utilised a computer model, the Weed Seed Wizard, to investigate the impact of employing HWSD every second year. Data from a long term trial in Merredin Western Australia demonstrated the value of residue burning (an early method of HWSD) compared to residue retention on the destruction of Lolium rigidum seed from 2003 to 2013. The agronomic practices utilised in this trial, soil type and rainfall at the field site, and crop yield data were used to parametrise two scenarios in the model. Scenario 1 was based on data from the field trial plots where residue was retained and scenario 2 was based on data from the plots where residue was burnt (i.e. HWSD). A third hypothetical scenario was based on scenario 2, but only incorporated HWSD in every second year. The model gave reasonable predictions of L. rigidum seed production each year (when compared to the actual seed production in the field trial), and accurately predicted when L. rigidum seed numbers would reach very low levels in scenario 2, due to annual HWSD. Scenario 3 indicated that HWSD in every second year could not reduce L. rigidum seeds to the same extent as annual HWSD, but the L. rigidum population was reduced to and maintained at less than one plant m−2 at harvest within four years. The model indicated that the total cost of weeds ranged from $85 ha−1 in scenario 1 to $32 and $27 ha−1 in scenario 3 and 2. However, income was greatest in scenario 1 as HWSD via burning residue caused a yield reduction in scenario 2 and 3. The results highlight both the benefits of HWSD as a weed management tactic and the value of the Weed Seed Wizard as a tool to investigate different IWM programs. © 2018",,No,No,No
Effect of heatwave conditions on aerosol optical properties derived from satellite and ground-based remote sensing over Poland,"During an exceptionally warm September in 2016, unique and stable weather conditions contributed to a heat wave over Poland, allowing for observations of aerosol optical properties, using a variety of ground-based and satellite remote sensors. The data set collected during 11-16 September 2016 was analysed in terms of aerosol transport (HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT)), aerosol load model simulations (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS), Global Environmental Multiscale-Air Quality (GEM-AQ), columnar aerosol load measured at ground level (Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET), Polish Aerosol Research Network (PolandAOD)) and from satellites (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)), as well as with 24/7 PollyXT Raman Lidar observations at the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) site in Warsaw. Analyses revealed a single day of a relatively clean background aerosol related to an Arctic air-mass inflow, surrounded by a few days with a well increased aerosol load of differing origin: pollution transported from Germany and biomass burning from Ukraine. Such conditions proved excellent to test developed-in-house algorithms designed for near real-time aerosol optical depth (AOD) derivation from the SEVIRI sensor. The SEVIRI AOD maps derived over the territory of Poland, with an exceptionally high resolution (every 15 min; 5.5 × 5.5 km2), revealed on an hourly scale, very low aerosol variability due to heat wave conditions. Comparisons of SEVIRI with NAAPS and CAMSAOD maps show strong qualitative similarities; however, NAAPS underestimates AOD and CAMS tends to underestimate it on relatively clean days (< 0.2), and overestimate it for a high aerosol load (> 0.4). A slight underestimation of the SEVIRI AOD is reported for pixel-to-column comparisons with AODs of several radiometers (AERONET, PolandAOD) and Lidar (EARLINET) with high correlation coefficients (r2 of 0.8-0.91) and low root-mean-square error (RMSE of 0.03-0.05). A heat wave driven increase of the boundary layer height of 10% is accompanied with the AOD increase of 8-12% for an urban site dominated by anthropogenic pollution. Contrary trend, with an AOD decrease of around 4% for a rural site dominated by a long-range transported biomass burning aerosol is reported. There is a positive feedback of heat wave conditions on local and transported pollution and an extenuating effect on transported biomass burning aerosol. The daytime mean SEVIRI PM2.5 converted from the SEVIRI AODs at a pixel representative for Warsaw is in agreement with the daily mean PM2.5 surface measurements, whereby SEVIRI PM2.5 and Lidar-derived Ångström exponent are anti-correlated. © 2018 by the authors.",,No,No,No
Secondary organic aerosol formation in biomass-burning plumes: Theoretical analysis of lab studies and ambient plumes,"Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) has been shown to form in biomass-burning emissions in laboratory and field studies. However, there is significant variability among studies in mass enhancement, which could be due to differences in fuels, fire conditions, dilution, and/or limitations of laboratory experiments and observations. This study focuses on understanding processes affecting biomass-burning SOA formation in laboratory smog-chamber experiments and in ambient plumes. Vapor wall losses have been demonstrated to be an important factor that can suppress SOA formation in laboratory studies of traditional SOA precursors; however, impacts of vapor wall losses on biomass-burning SOA have not yet been investigated. We use an aerosol-microphysical model that includes representations of volatility and oxidation chemistry to estimate the influence of vapor wall loss on SOA formation observed in the FLAME III smog-chamber studies. Our simulations with base-case assumptions for chemistry and wall loss predict a mean OA mass enhancement (the ratio of final to initial OA mass, corrected for particle-phase wall losses) of 1.8 across all experiments when vapor wall losses are modeled, roughly matching the mean observed enhancement during FLAME III. The mean OA enhancement increases to over 3 when vapor wall losses are turned off, implying that vapor wall losses reduce the apparent SOA formation. We find that this decrease in the apparent SOA formation due to vapor wall losses is robust across the ranges of uncertainties in the key model assumptions for wall-loss and mass-transfer coefficients and chemical mechanisms. We then apply similar assumptions regarding SOA formation chemistry and physics to smoke emitted into the atmosphere. In ambient plumes, the plume dilution rate impacts the organic partitioning between the gas and particle phases, which may impact the potential for SOA to form as well as the rate of SOA formation. We add Gaussian dispersion to our aerosol-microphysical model to estimate how SOA formation may vary under different ambient-plume conditions (e.g., fire size, emission mass flux, atmospheric stability). Smoke from small fires, such as typical prescribed burns, dilutes rapidly, which drives evaporation of organic vapor from the particle phase, leading to more effective SOA formation. Emissions from large fires, such as intense wildfires, dilute slowly, suppressing OA evaporation and subsequent SOA formation in the near field. We also demonstrate that different approaches to the calculation of OA enhancement in ambient plumes can lead to different conclusions regarding SOA formation. OA mass enhancement ratios of around 1 calculated using an inert tracer, such as black carbon or CO, have traditionally been interpreted as exhibiting little or no SOA formation; however, we show that SOA formation may have greatly contributed to the mass in these plumes. In comparison of laboratory and plume results, the possible inconsistency of OA enhancement between them could be in part attributed to the effect of chamber walls and plume dilution. Our results highlight that laboratory and field experiments that focus on the fuel and fire conditions also need to consider the effects of plume dilution or vapor losses to walls. © Author(s) 2017.",,No,No,No
Urban local air quality management framework for non-attainment areas in Indian cities,"Increasing urban air pollution level in Indian cities is one of the major concerns for policy makers due to its impact on public health. The growth in population and increase in associated motorised road transport demand is one of the major causes of increasing air pollution in most urban areas along with other sources e.g., road dust, construction dust, biomass burning etc. The present study documents the development of an urban local air quality management (ULAQM) framework at urban hotspots (non-attainment area) and a pathway for the flow of information from goal setting to policy making. The ULAQM also includes assessment and management of air pollution episodic conditions at these hotspots, which currently available city/regional-scale air quality management plans do not address. The prediction of extreme pollutant concentrations using a hybrid model differentiates the ULAQM from other existing air quality management plans. The developed ULAQM framework has been applied and validated at one of the busiest traffic intersections in Delhi and Chennai cities. Various scenarios have been tested targeting the effective reductions in elevated levels of NOx and PM2.5 concentrations. The results indicate that a developed ULAQM framework is capable of providing an evidence-based graded action to reduce ambient pollution levels within the specified standard level at pre-identified locations. The ULAQM framework methodology is generalised and therefore can be applied to other non-attainment areas of the country. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,No,No,No
Comparative assessment of aerosol optical properties over a mega city and an adjacent urban area in India,"The present work revolves around the comparative analysis of aerosol optical properties in a mega city, Delhi and in a nearby urban area, Rohtak. It is pertinent to note that despite of the close proximity and similar meteorological conditions, the two study locations show significant differences in aerosol characteristics. The study is conducted using ground based Sky-radiometer measurements for a period of one year. The mean annual Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 500 nm over Delhi and Rohtak is observed to be 1.01 and 0.73 respectively, with correlation coefficient of 0.67 and mean absolute difference of 0.51. The magnitude of AOD in Delhi is higher than in Rohtak throughout the year, except in post-monsoon season. The difference in Angstrom exponent (alpha) between the stations is minimal. However, lower magnitude of alpha is observed in Rohtak, indicating presence of more concentration of coarse-mode particles. Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) also shows seasonal variation with significantly lower values in Delhi throughout the year, indicating contribution of absorbing type of aerosols (like black carbon). The volume concentration in fine-size is found to be higher in Delhi than in Rohtak, indicating combined effect of dust, vehicular, biomass burning and industrial emissions. The aerosol classification via relationship between AOD and alpha shows that urban/biomass burning (U/B) aerosols are dominant in Delhi and mixed type (MT) aerosols in Rohtak during winter and pre-monsoon. © 2017, India Meteorological Department.

Retrieval of aerosol optical thickness from satellite images through machine learning,"Aerosol measurements are routinely obtained through ground observation networks of sun-photometers such as the AERONET. Such implementation gives accurate and periodic observations of aerosol properties at each ground-based station. Satellite observations can provide wide areal coverage of aerosol optical thickness (AOT). However, the retrieval of AOT from satellite data usually involves execution of complex radiative transfer codes and is complicated by the influence of different ground covers. In this study, the retreival of AOT at 550 nm (AOT550) from satellite images using machine learning is presented. Simulated satellite signals were generated using the Py6S, a python interface to the 6S (Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) Radiative Transfer Model (RTM). The simulated data were based on the different permutations of varying geometrical conditions, atmospheric models, spectral conditions and ground reflectances. A feedforward neural network (NN) with backpropagation algorithm was implemented. The dataset was used for training, validation and testing of the NN model. The trained NN model was then applied to retrieve the value of AOT550 from the satellite images. The plot of actual against retrieved AOT550 had achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.716. The machine learning method has shown a promising capability for the spatial and temporal monitoring of aerosols distribution, especially during episodes of biomass burning. © 2017 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

Deriving High-Resolution Emission Inventory of Open Biomass Burning in China based on Satellite Observations,"Open biomass burning plays an important role in atmospheric pollution and in climate change. However, the current emission inventory of open biomass burning is generally of highly uncertainty because of missing small fire data and limited resolution because of the lack of localized vegetation data. In this study, the MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) burned area product MCD64Al combined with the active fire product MCD14 ML, as well as a high-resolution land cover data set, were applied to develop a high-resolution emission inventory of open biomass burning in China in 2013. Total CO, CH4, NOx, NMVOC (nonmethane volatile organic compounds), SO2, NH3, PM2.5, PM10, OC (organic carbon), BC (black carbon), and CO2 emissions were estimated to be 1.03 × 104, 666, 536, 1.91 × 103, 87, 138, 1.45 × 103, 2.09 × 103, 741, 137, and 2.45 × 105 Gg, respectively. The provinces that contributed the most emissions included Heilongjiang, Henan, Shandong, and Jilin. The major source for all pollutants was cropland burning, whereas Xizang, Xinjiang, and Heilongjiang had greater emissions from natural vegetation. The temporal distribution of average provincial emissions showed that the peaks were in June and October. This study updated the emission information that may support future research and policy-making on air pollution control and GHG emission abatement. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,No,No,No
Intra-urban biomonitoring: Source apportionment using tree barks to identify air pollution sources,"It is of great interest to evaluate if there is a relationship between possible sources and trace elements using biomonitoring techniques. In this study, tree bark samples of 171 trees were collected using a biomonitoring technique in the inner city of São Paulo. The trace elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Cl, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Rb, S, Sr and Zn) were determined by the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to identify the plausible sources associated with tree bark measurements. The greatest source was vehicle-induced non-tailpipe emissions derived mainly from brakes and tires wear-out and road dust resuspension (characterized with Al, Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn), which was explained by 27.1% of the variance, followed by cement (14.8%), sea salt (11.6%) and biomass burning (10%), and fossil fuel combustion (9.8%). We also verified that the elements related to vehicular emission showed different concentrations at different sites of the same street, which might be helpful for a new street classification according to the emission source. The spatial distribution maps of element concentrations were obtained to evaluate the different levels of pollution in streets and avenues. Results indicated that biomonitoring techniques using tree bark can be applied to evaluate dispersion of air pollution and provide reliable data for the further epidemiological studies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,No,No,No
Deriving aerosol hygroscopic mixing state from size-resolved CCN activity and HR-ToF-AMS measurements,"The ability of a particle to uptake water and form a cloud droplet depends on its hygroscopicity. To understand its impact on cloud properties and ultimately radiative forcing, knowledge of chemically-resolved mixing state information or the one based on hygroscopic growth is crucial. Typically, global models assume either pure internal or external mixing state which might not be true for all conditions and sampling locations. To investigate into this, the current study employed an indirect approach to infer the probable mixing state. The hygroscopic parameters derived from κ-Kohler theory using size-resolved CCN measurements (κCCN) and bulk/size-resolved aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements (κAMS) were compared. The accumulation mode particles were found to be more hygroscopic (κCCN = 0.24) than Aitken mode (κCCN = 0.13), perhaps due to increased ratio of inorganic to organic mass fraction. The activation diameter calculated from size-resolved CCN activity measurements at 5 different supersaturation (SS) levels varied in the range of 115 nm–42 nm with κCCN = 0.13–0.23 (avg = 0.18 ± 0.10 (±1σ)). Further, κAMS> κCCN was observed possibly due to the fact that organic and inorganic mass present in the Aitken mode was not correctly represented by bulk chemical composition and size-resolved fractional contribution of oxidized OA was not accurately accounted. Better correlation of organic fraction (forg) and κCCN at lower SS explained this behaviour. The decrease in κCCN with the time of the day was more pronounced at lower SS because of the relative mass reduction of soluble inorganic species by ∼17%. Despite the large differences between κ measured from two approaches, less over-prediction (up to 18%) between measured and predicted CCN concentration suggested lower impact of chemical composition and mixing state at higher SS. However, at lower SS, presences of externally mixed CCN-inactive aerosols lead to CCN over-prediction reflecting the significance of aerosol mixing state information. Further examination of the effect of biomass burning aerosols (∼35% in least oxidized biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA-2 fraction) on hygroscopicity and CCN activity showed increase in the concentration of all AMS measured species (except NH4+ and SO42−), less O:C ratio, and organic mass fraction (forg) peak shift to lower diameter range caused ∼13% change in critical diameter (Da) and ∼40% change in κCCN. Increased deviation of ∼100% between κCCN and κAMS due to sudden influx of internally mixed BBOA caused suppressed hygroscopic growth. This study finally suggests the assumption of pure internally mixed aerosol does not completely hold true for this anthropogenically polluted site. © 2016",,No,No,No
Emissions of hydrogen cyanide from on-road gasoline and diesel vehicles,"Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is considered a marker for biomass burning emissions and is a component of vehicle exhaust. Despite its potential health impacts, vehicular HCN emissions estimates and their contribution to regional budgets are highly uncertain. In the current study, Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) was used to measure HCN emission factors from the exhaust of individual diesel, biodiesel and gasoline vehicles. Laboratory emissions data as a function of fuel type and driving mode were combined with ambient measurement data and model predictions. The results indicate that gasoline vehicles have the highest emissions of HCN (relative to diesel fuel) and that biodiesel fuel has the potential to significantly reduce HCN emissions even at realistic 5% blend levels. The data further demonstrate that gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines emit more HCN than their port fuel injection (PFI) counterparts, suggesting that the expected full transition of vehicle fleets to GDI will increase HCN emissions. Ambient measurements of HCN in a traffic dominated area of Toronto, Canada were strongly correlated to vehicle emission markers and consistent with regional air quality model predictions of ambient air HCN, indicating that vehicle emissions of HCN are the dominant source of exposure in urban areas. The results further indicate that additional work is required to quantify HCN emissions from the modern vehicle fleet, particularly in light of continuously changing engine, fuel and after-treatment technologies. © 2016.",,No,No,No
Aerosol climatology over the Mexico City basin: Characterization of optical properties,"Climatology of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), and aerosol particle-size distribution were analyzed using a 15-year (1999–2014) dataset from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations over the Mexico City (MC) basin. The atmosphere over this site is dominated by two main aerosol types, represented by urban/industrial pollution and biomass-burning particles. Due to the specific meteorological conditions within the basin, seasons are usually classified into three as follows: Dry Winter (DW) (November–February); Dry Spring (DS) (March–April), and the RAiny season (RA) (May–October), which are mentioned throughout this article. Using a CIMEL sun photometer, we conducted continuous observations over the MC urban area from January 1999 to December 2014. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Ångström exponent (α440–870), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), and aerosol particle-size distribution were derived from the observational data. The overall mean AOD500 during the 1999–2014 period was 0.34 ± 0.07. The monthly mean AOD reached a maximal value of 0.49 in May and a minimal value of 0.27 in February and March. The average α440–870 value for the period studied was 1.50 ± 0.16. The monthly average of α440–870 reached a minimal value of 1.32 in August and a maximal value of 1.61 in May. Average SSA at 440 nm was 0.89 throughout the observation period, indicating that aerosols over Mexico City are composed mainly of absorptive particles. Concentrations of fine- and coarse-mode aerosols over MC were highest in DS season compared with other seasons, especially for particles with radii measuring between 0.1 and 0.2 μm. Results from the Spectral De-convolution Algorithm (SDA) show that fine-mode aerosols dominated AOD variability in MC. In the final part of this article, we present a classification of aerosols in MC by using the graphical method proposed by Gobbi et al. (2007), which is based on the combined analysis of α and its spectral curvature δα. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,No,No,No
The effects of height on the accumulation of n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in air-conditioning filter dust from high-rise apartments,"To assess the effect of floor levels of high-rise apartment buildings on the accumulation of contaminants in indoor environment, residential air-conditioner filter dust (ACFD) samples from the 1st, 10th, 20th and 30th floors of a high-rise apartment building were collected for the determination of n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results show that both n-alkanes and PAHs in the residential ACFD were ubiquitous but varied greatly in concentrations. The total concentrations of 27 n-alkanes (Σ27AK) and 16 PAHs (Σ16PAH) ranged from 1.35 to 9290 µg g–1 and 278–34200 ng g–1, respectively. Source apportionment revealed that n-alkanes were from mixed sources combining fossil fuel combustion, natural emission and solid biomass burning, but PAHs were mainly from indoor sources. Furthermore, the diagnostic ratio of paired low weight molecular PAH species may change during transportation and accumulation. Significantly higher concentrations of Σ27AK and Σ16PAH were observed in the samples from low floor levels (the 1st and 10th floors) compared to those from high floor levels (the 20th and 30th floors). The results of classification and regression tree analysis clearly suggested floor level is the most important factor influencing the accumulation of Σ27AK and Σ16PAH in the ACFD. Our findings imply that people living on lower floor levels have greater exposure risks to PAHs associated with indoor dust. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.",,No,No,No
In vitro toxicity and epigenotoxicity of different types of ambient particulate matter,"Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) has been associated with adverse health effects, including pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Studies indicate that ambient PM originated from different sources may cause distinct biological effects. In this study, we sought to investigate the potential of various types of PM to cause epigenetic alterations in the in vitro system. RAW264.7 murine macrophages were exposed for 24 and 72 h to 5- and 50-μg/ml doses of the water soluble extract of 6 types of PM: soil dust, road dust, agricultural dust, traffic exhausts, biomass burning, and pollen, collected in January-April of 2014 in the area of Little Rock, Arkansas. Cytotoxicity, oxidative potential, epigenetic endpoints, and chromosomal aberrations were addressed. Exposure to 6 types of PM resulted in induction of cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in a type-, time-, and dose-dependent manner. Epigenetic alterations were characterized by type-, time-, and dose-dependent decreases of DNA methylation/demethylation machinery, increased DNA methyltransferases enzymatic activity and protein levels, and transcriptional activation and subsequent silencing of transposable elements LINE-1, SINE B1/B2. The most pronounced changes were observed after exposure to soil dust that were also characterized by hypomethylation and reactivation of satellite DNA and structural chromosomal aberrations in the exposed cells. The results of our study indicate that the water-soluble fractions of the various types of PM have differential potential to target the cellular epigenome. © The Author 2015.

HULIS Enhancement of Hydroxyl Radical Formation from Fe(II): Kinetics of Fulvic Acid-Fe(II) Complexes in the Presence of Lung Antioxidants,"Oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a hypothesized mechanism for particulate-matter related health effects. Fe(II) is a key player in ROS formation in surrogate lung fluid (SLF) containing antioxidants. Humic-like substances (HULIS) in particulate matter such as biomass burning aerosol chelate Fe(II), but the effect on ROS formation in the presence of lung antioxidants is not known. We use Suwanee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) as a surrogate for HULIS and investigate its effect on OH formation from Fe(II). For the first time, a chemical kinetics model was developed to explain behavior of Fe(II) and SRFA in SLF. Model and experimental results are used to find best-fit rate coefficients for key reactions. Modeling results indicate SRFA enhances Fe-mediated reduction of O2 to O2- and destruction of H2O2 to OH to 5.1 ± 1.5 and (4.3 ± 1.4) × 103 M-1 s-1 respectively. Best-fit rates for Citrate-Fe(II) mediated O2 to O2- and H2O2 to OH were 3.0 ± 0.7 and (4.2 ± 1.7) × 103 M-1 s-1 respectively. The kinetics model agrees with both the experimental results and thermodynamic model calculations of chemical speciation for 0 and 5 μg/mL SRFA, but both models are less successful at predicting further enhancements to OH formation at higher SRFA Concentrations. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,No,No,No
Multi-scale analysis of snow dynamics at the southern margin of the North American continental snow distribution,"Snow provides a key water source for stream flow and agricultural production across western North America and drinking water for large populations in the Southwest. Accurate estimates of snow cover spatial distribution and temporal dynamics are important at regional and local scales as snow cover is projected to decrease due to global climate change. We examined regional-scale temporal trends in snow distribution across central and northern Arizona using two tiles of 2928 daily images of MOD10 snow product. The analysis included the entire MODIS archive time period, October 1, 2003-June 1, 2014, and a 245,041km2 area of 51 HUC8 watersheds. We also examined the effects of a regional forest restoration effort, known as the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), aimed at enhancing snow accumulation and retention for increased groundwater recharge through forest thinning and burning treatments. We analyzed 66 Landsat TM/ETM+ images spanning 26years between 1988 and 2014 at five sites and one hyperspectral image from 2014 at two sites. The MOD10 snow product performs well in estimating Arizona's thin and discontinuous snow distribution. Mann-Kendall time-series analysis indicate significantly increasing trends in the annual number of snow cover days (SCD) over the 12-year period in 1.6% of the region at elevation transitions such as the Mogollon Rim in central Arizona, while significantly decreasing trends are observed at a few locations of lower elevations leading to the desert margins in eastern Arizona. The observed temporal trends are mostly consistent with ground-based SNOTEL snow measurements. An Arizona specific, Landsat sensor-derived binary classification model, similar to the MOD10 product, was developed at a local scale. It performs better than commonly-used simple threshold-based approaches, but demonstrates the continued challenges associated with Landsat sensor-derived snow classification in Arizona likely due to its coarse temporal resolution. Landsat-derived multi-temporal Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) analysis indicate that treated (thinned and thinned-and-burned) forest sites had significantly greater NDSI values than untreated control sites. Snowpack at treated sites also appeared to persist longer into the spring season with potentially greater contributions to groundwater recharge in this semi-arid region. The high-resolution hyperspectral data analysis indicate that sites treated to approximately 24% forest canopy cover appear to have an optimum threshold for accumulating and maintaining snowpack. It balances canopy cover versus canopy gap, which reduces snow interception and sublimation by canopy, while providing enough shade. These results are encouraging for the 4FRI, the first and largest forest restoration effort in the US history, aimed at improving watershed health and function in the face of changing climate. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..",,No,No,No
Biomass burning aerosols characterization from ground based and profiling measurements,"The study goal is to assess the chemical and optical properties of aerosols present in the lofted layers and at the ground. The biomass burning aerosols were evaluated in low level layers from multi-wavelength lidar measurements, while chemical composition at ground was assessed using an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) and an Aethalometer. Classification of aerosol type and specific organic markers were used to explore the potential to sense the particles from the same origin at ground base and on profiles. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,No,No,No
Aerosol meteorology of Maritime Continent for the 2012 7SEAS southwest monsoon intensive study-Part 2: Philippine receptor observations of fine-scale aerosol behavior,"The largest 7 Southeast Asian Studies (7SEAS) operations period within the Maritime Continent (MC) occurred in the August-September 2012 biomass burning season. Data included were observations aboard the M/Y Vasco, dispatched to the Palawan Archipelago and Sulu Sea of the Philippines for September 2012. At these locations, the Vasco observed MC smoke and pollution entering the southwest monsoon (SWM) monsoonal trough. Here we describe the research cruise findings and the finer-scale aerosol meteorology of this convectively active region. This 2012 cruise complemented a 2-week cruise in 2011 and was generally consistent with previous findings in terms of how smoke emission and transport related to monsoonal flows, tropical cyclones (TC), and the covariance between smoke transport events and the atmosphere's thermodynamic structure. Biomass burning plumes were usually mixed with significant amounts of anthropogenic pollution. Also key to aerosol behavior were squall lines and cold pools propagating across the South China Sea (SCS) and scavenging aerosol particles in their path. However, the 2012 cruise showed much higher modulation in aerosol frequency than its 2011 counterpart. Whereas in 2011 large synoptic-scale aerosol events transported high concentrations of smoke into the Philippines over days, in 2012 measured aerosol events exhibited a much shorter-term variation, sometimes only 3-12 h. Strong monsoonal flow reversals were also experienced in 2012. Nucleation events in cleaner and polluted conditions, as well as in urban plumes, were observed. Perhaps most interestingly, several cases of squall lines preceding major aerosol events were observed, as opposed to 2011 observations where these lines largely scavenged aerosol particles from the marine boundary layer. Combined, these observations indicate pockets of high and low particle counts that are not uncommon in the region. These perturbations are difficult to observe by satellite and very difficult to model. Indeed, the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) simulations captured longer period aerosol events quite well but largely failed to capture the timing of high-frequency phenomena. Ultimately, the research findings of these cruises demonstrate the real world challenges of satellite-based missions, significant aerosol life cycle questions such as those the future Aerosol/Clouds/Ecosystems (ACE) will investigate, and the importance of small-scale phenomena such as sea breezes, squall lines, and nucleation events embedded within SWM patterns in dominating aerosol life cycle and potential relationships to clouds. © 2016 The Author(s).",,No,No,No
Identification of aerosol types over an urban site based on air-mass trajectory classification,"Columnar aerosol properties retrieved from MICROTOPS II Sun Photometer measurements during 2010-2013 over Pune (18°32'N; 73°49'E, 559m amsl), a tropical urban station in India, are analyzed to identify aerosol types in the atmospheric column. Identification/classification is carried out on the basis of dominant airflow patterns, and the method of discrimination of aerosol types on the basis of relation between aerosol optical depth (AOD500nm) and Ångström exponent (AE, α). Five potential advection pathways viz., NW/N, SW/S, N, SE/E and L have been identified over the observing site by employing the NOAA-HYSPLIT air mass back trajectory analysis. Based on AE against AOD500nm scatter plot and advection pathways followed five major aerosol types viz., continental average (CA), marine continental average (MCA), urban/industrial and biomass burning (UB), desert dust (DD) and indeterminate or mixed type (MT) have been identified. In winter, sector SE/E, a representative of air masses traversed over Bay of Bengal and Eastern continental Indian region has relatively small AOD (τpλ=0.43±0.13) and high AE (α=1.19±0.15). These values imply the presence of accumulation/sub-micron size anthropogenic aerosols. During pre-monsoon, aerosols from the NW/N sector have high AOD (τpλ=0.61±0.21), and low AE (α=0.54±0.14) indicating an increase in the loading of coarse-mode particles over Pune. Dominance of UB type in winter season for all the years (i.e. 2010-2013) may be attributed to both local/transported aerosols. During pre-monsoon seasons, MT is the dominant aerosol type followed by UB and DD, while the background aerosols are insignificant. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",,No,No,No
Investigation of the Fire Radiative Energy Biomass Combustion Coefficient: A Comparison of Polar and Geostationary Satellite Retrievals Over the Conterminous United States,"Biomass burning substantially contributes to atmospheric aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions that influence climate and air quality. Fire radiative energy (FRE) (units: MJ) has been demonstrated to be linearly related to biomass consumption (units: kg) with potential for improving biomass burning emission estimation. The scalar constant, termed herein as the FRE biomass combustion coefficient (FBCC) (units: kg/MJ), which converts FRE to biomass consumption, has been estimated using field and laboratory experiments, varying from 0.368 to 0.453 kg/MJ. However, quite different FBCC values, especially for satellite-based approaches, have been reported. This study investigated the FBCC with respect to 445 wildfires that occurred from 2011 to 2012 across the Conterminous United States (CONUS) considering both polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite data. The FBCC was derived by comparing satellite FRE estimates with biomass consumption for the CONUS. FRE was estimated using observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES); biomass consumption was estimated using Landsat-derived burned areas with fuel loadings from the Fuel Characteristic Classification System and using combustion completeness parameterized by Landsat burn severity and Fuel Characteristic Classification System fuelbed type. The reported results confirm the linearity of the empirical relationship between FRE and biomass consumption for wildfires. The CONUS FBCC was 0.374 kg/MJ for GOES FRE, 0.266 kg/MJ for MODIS FRE, and 0.320 kg/MJ considering both GOES and MODIS FRE. Limited sensitivity analyses, comparing MODIS and GOES FRE with biomass consumption estimated in three different ways, indicated that the FBCC varied from 0.301 to 0.458 kg/MJ. ©2018.

The importance of plume rise on the concentrations and atmospheric impacts of biomass burning aerosol,"We quantified the effects of the plume rise of biomass burning aerosol and gases for the forest fires that occurred in Saskatchewan, Canada, in July 2010. For this purpose, simulations with different assumptions regarding the plume rise and the vertical distribution of the emissions were conducted. Based on comparisons with observations, applying a one-dimensional plume rise model to predict the injection layer in combination with a parametrization of the vertical distribution of the emissions outperforms approaches in which the plume heights are initially predefined. Approximately 30 % of the fires exceed the height of 2 km with a maximum height of 8.6 km. Using this plume rise model, comparisons with satellite images in the visible spectral range show a very good agreement between the simulated and observed spatial distributions of the biomass burning plume. The simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) with data of an AERONET station is in good agreement with respect to the absolute values and the timing of the maximum. Comparison of the vertical distribution of the biomass burning aerosol with CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) retrievals also showed the best agreement when the plume rise model was applied. We found that downwelling surface short-wave radiation below the forest fire plume is reduced by up to 50 % and that the 2 m temperature is decreased by up to 6 K. In addition, we simulated a strong change in atmospheric stability within the biomass burning plume. © Author(s) 2016.",,No,No,No
Particle water and pH in the eastern Mediterranean: Source variability and implications for nutrient availability,"Particle water (liquid water content, LWC) and aerosol pH are important parameters of the aerosol phase, affecting heterogeneous chemistry and bioavailability of nutrients that profoundly impact cloud formation, atmospheric composition, and atmospheric fluxes of nutrients to ecosystems. Few measurements of in situ LWC and pH, however, exist in the published literature. Using concurrent measurements of aerosol chemical composition, cloud condensation nuclei activity, and tandem light scattering coefficients, the particle water mass concentrations associated with the aerosol inorganic (<i>W</i>inorg) and organic (<i>W</i>org) components are determined for measurements conducted at the Finokalia atmospheric observation station in the eastern Mediterranean between June and November 2012. These data are interpreted using the ISORROPIA-II thermodynamic model to predict the pH of aerosols originating from the various sources that influence air quality in the region. On average, closure between predicted aerosol water and that determined by comparison of ambient with dry light scattering coefficients was achieved to within 8ĝ€% (slopeĝ€ Combining double low line ĝ€0.92, <i>R</i>2ĝ€ Combining double low line ĝ€0.8, <i>n</i>ĝ€ Combining double low line ĝ€5201 points). Based on the scattering measurements, a parameterization is also derived, capable of reproducing the hygroscopic growth factor (<i>f</i>(RH)) within 15ĝ€% of the measured values. The highest aerosol water concentrations are observed during nighttime, when relative humidity is highest and the collapse of the boundary layer increases the aerosol concentration. A significant diurnal variability is found for <i>W</i>org with morning and afternoon average mass concentrations being 10-15 times lower than nighttime concentrations, thus rendering <i>W</i>inorg the main form of particle water during daytime. The average value of total aerosol water was 2.19ĝ€±ĝ€1.75ĝ€μgĝ€mĝ'3, contributing on average up to 33ĝ€% of the total submicron mass concentration. Average aerosol water associated with organics, <i>W</i>org, was equal to 0.56ĝ€±ĝ€0.37ĝ€μgĝ€mĝ'3; thus, organics contributed about 27.5ĝ€% to the total aerosol water, mostly during early morning, late evening, and nighttime hours.</p><p classCombining double low line""p"">The aerosol was found to be highly acidic with calculated aerosol pH varying from 0.5 to 2.8 throughout the study period. Biomass burning aerosol presented the highest values of pH in the submicron fraction and the lowest values in total water mass concentration. The low pH values observed in the submicron mode and independently of air mass origin could increase nutrient availability and especially P solubility, which is the nutrient limiting sea water productivity of the eastern Mediterranean. © Author(s) 2016.",,No,No,No
Responses of deposition and bioaccumulation in the Great Lakes region to policy and other large-scale drivers of mercury emissions,"Mercury (Hg) emissions pose a global problem that requires global cooperation for a solution. However, neither emissions nor regulations are uniform world-wide, and hence the impacts of regulations are also likely to vary regionally. We report here an approach to model the effectiveness of regulations at different scales (local, regional, global) in reducing Hg deposition and fish Hg concentrations in the Laurentian Great Lakes (GL) region. The potential effects of global change on deposition are also modeled. We focus on one of the most vulnerable communities within the region, an Indigenous tribe in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (UP) with a high fish consumption rate. For the GL region, elements of global change (climate, biomass burning, land use) are projected to have modest impacts (<5% change from the year 2000) on Hg deposition. For this region, our estimate of the effects of elimination of anthropogenic emissions is a 70% decrease in deposition, while our minimal regulation scenario increases emissions by 35%. Existing policies have the potential to reduce deposition by 20% with most of the reduction attributable to U.S. policies. Local policies within the Great Lakes region show little effect, and global policy as embedded in the Minamata Convention is projected to decrease deposition by approximately 2.8%. Even within the GL region, effects of policy are not uniform; areas close to emission sources (Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania) experience larger decreases in deposition than other areas including Michigan's UP. The UP landscape is highly sensitive to Hg deposition, with nearly 80% of lakes estimated to be impaired. Sensitivity to mercury is caused primarily by the region's abundant wetlands. None of the modeled policy scenarios are projected to reduce fish Hg concentrations to the target that would be safe for the local tribe. Regions like Michigan's UP that are highly sensitive to mercury deposition and that will see little reduction in deposition due to regulations require more aggressive policies to reduce emissions to achieve recovery. We highlight scientific uncertainties that continue to limit our ability to accurately predict fish Hg changes over time. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,No,No,No
Shortwave direct radiative effects of above-cloud aerosols over global oceans derived from 8 years of CALIOP and MODIS observations,"In this paper, we studied the frequency of occurrence and shortwave direct radiative effects (DREs) of abovecloud aerosols (ACAs) over global oceans using 8 years (2007-2014) of collocated CALIOP and MODIS observations. Similar to previous work, we found high ACA occurrence in four regions: southeastern (SE) Atlantic region, where ACAs are mostly light-absorbing aerosols, i.e., smoke and polluted dust according to CALIOP classification, originating from biomass burning over the African Savanna; tropical northeastern (TNE) Atlantic and the Arabian Sea, where ACAs are predominantly windblown dust from the Sahara and Arabian deserts, respectively; and the northwestern (NW) Pacific, where ACAs are mostly transported smoke and polluted dusts from Asian. From radiative transfer simulations based on CALIOP-MODIS observations and a set of the preselected aerosol optical models, we found the DREs of ACAs at the top of atmosphere (TOA) to be positive (i.e., warming) in the SE Atlantic and NW Pacific regions, but negative (i.e., cooling) in the TNE Atlantic Ocean and the Arabian Sea. The cancellation of positive and negative regional DREs results in a global ocean annual mean diurnally averaged cloudy-sky DRE of 0.015Wm-2 (range of -0.03 to 0.06Wm-2/ at TOA. The DREs at surface and within the atmosphere are -0.15Wm-2 (range of -0.09 to -0.21Wm-2/, and 0.17Wm-2 (range of 0.11 to 0.24Wm-2/, respectively. The regional and seasonal mean DREs are much stronger. For example, in the SE Atlantic region, the JJA (July-August) seasonal mean cloudy-sky DRE is about 0.7Wm-2 (range of 0.2 to 1.2Wm-2/ at TOA. All our DRE computations are publicly available1. The uncertainty in our DRE computations is mainly caused by the uncertainties in the aerosol optical properties, in particular aerosol absorption, the uncertainties in the CALIOP operational aerosol optical thickness retrieval, and the ignorance of cloud and potential aerosol diurnal cycle. In situ and remotely sensed measurements of ACA from future field campaigns and satellite missions and improved lidar retrieval algorithm, in particular vertical feature masking, would help reduce the uncertainty. © 2016 Author(s).",,No,No,No
"Comparison of Aerosol Optical Properties Between Two Nearby Urban Sites in Beijing, China","This study compares the aerosol optical properties measured by CE318 sunphotometers at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics and the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences in Beijing between January 2013 and July 2015 to provide the framework to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of aerosol properties. Aerosol optical parameters included extinction (scattering plus absorption) aerosol optical depth (EAOD), extinction Ångström exponent (EAE), columnar water vapor (CWV), absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD), absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), extinction aerosol optical depth of fine particles (EAODf), extinction aerosol optical depth of coarse particles (EAODc), real parts of the refractive index (REFR), imaginary parts of the refractive index (REFI), single scattering albedo (SSA), asymmetry factor (ASYM), size distribution, and sphericity fraction. Comparison of aerosol optical properties using the simultaneous observations between two sites showed that correlation coefficients were larger than or equal to 0.98 for EAOD, EAE, and CWV, but smaller than or equal to 0.90 for AAOD, REFR, REFI, and SSA; the percentage differences for most of the parameters were less than 2%, but for EAODf were relatively large, ranging from 4.35 to 6.45%; the mean size distributions simultaneously showed bi-modal patterns, with two peak volumes at the radii of 0.15 and 2.94 μm; two kinds of tri-peak model were apparent during the study period; a case of EAODs at 440 nm differing by more than 0.2 between the two sites reflected the effect of local aerosol pollution. Comparison of aerosol characterization inferred by absorption properties using all the inversion data showed that classification using EAE, AAE, and sphericity fraction indicated the main aerosol type was “U/I&BB” (urban/industrial and biomass-burning), accounting for 59.87 and 57.43%, respectively; the volume size distribution retrievals binned by AAE exhibited coarse mode particles became dominant as AAE increased to 2.0; the SSA retrievals binned by AAE demonstrated SSA transitioned from spectra representing dust to U/I&BB pollution; averaged SSA for all the retrievals and SSA data partitioned by the EAE and η675 nm suggested there were more absorbing aerosols at IAP. The results of the study will be beneficial in validating satellite observations and model simulation results, providing more accurate input parameters for model simulations. © 2017, Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy Sciences.",,No,No,No
"One-year study of polycyclic aromatic compounds at an urban site in Grenoble (France): Seasonal variations, gas/particle partitioning and cancer risk estimation","21 PAHs, 27 oxy-PAHs and 32 nitro-PAHs were measured every third day over a year in both gaseous (G) and particulate PM10 (P) phases in ambient air of Grenoble (France). Mean total concentrations (G + P) of PAHs and oxy-PAHs were in the same range and about 10 ng m− 3. Nitro-PAHs were 50 to 100 times less concentrated averaging 100 pg m− 3. Polycyclic aromatic compound (PAC) concentrations were 5 to 7 times higher in “cold” period (October to March) than in “warm” period (April to September). Seasonal variations may be explained by higher primary emissions from residential heating, especially biomass burning in “cold” season. Meteorological conditions and influence of the geomorphology around Grenoble, with the formation of thermal inversion layers leading to the stagnation of pollutants, were additional key parameters. Maximum individual PAC concentrations were observed during two PM10 pollution events in December and February–March. Chemical processes and secondary formation of oxy- and nitro-PAH were probably enhanced by the accumulation of the pollutants during these events. PAC gas/particle partitioning depended on compound molecular weight and vapour pressure. Gas/particle partitioning of oxy- and nitro-PAHs were evaluated using a multi-phase poly-parameter linear free energy relationship model. The PAC cancer risk was assessed using toxic equivalency factors available in the literature (19 PAHs, 10 nitro-PAHs and 1 oxy-PAH). Overall, particle-bound PACs contributed about 76% of the cancer risk. While PAHs accounted for most of the total PAC cancer risk, oxy- and nitro-PAHs could account for up to 24%. The risk quantification across substance classes is limited by toxicological data availability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,No,No,No
"Classification of key aerosol types and their frequency distributions based on satellite remote sensing data at an industrially polluted city in the Yangtze River Delta, China","In the present study, characterization of columnar aerosol optical properties and classifying the major aerosol types was investigated at an urban–industrial city, Nanjing in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region over East China using simultaneous data sets retrieved from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) sensors during 2004–2015. A notable spatiotemporal heterogeneity was observed in the optical properties of aerosols on the seasonal scale over East China. Aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD550) exhibited pronounced seasonal variability over Nanjing in the YRD, with higher values during summer and spring seasons and lower in winter. Ångström exponent (AE470–660) found higher in summer indicating the relative abundance of fine mode aerosols over the coarse mode. We also used the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model for presenting cluster trajectory analysis which revealed that the airmasses from different source regions contributed greatly to aerosol loading during the study period. In addition, we followed two techniques for studying classification of major aerosol types based on the predefined thresholds. Using the AOD–AE method (here called as Technique-I), five major aerosol types were identified via, continental clean (CC), marine (MA), biomass burning/urban–industrial (BU), desert dust (DD), and mixed (MX). In all the seasons, MX is the dominant aerosol type followed by the BU and DD type aerosols during summer and spring seasons, respectively. Further, the sub-classification of aerosol types was carried out considering into account of the characteristics of absorbing aerosol index (AAI) (here called as Technique-II). The two clustering techniques showed reasonable consistency in the obtained results. The various aerosol types (absorbing and non-absorbing) and their change over a region are highly helpful in fine tuning the models to decrease the uncertainty in the radiative and climatic effects of aerosols. © 2017 Royal Meteorological Society",,No,No,No
Evaluating fire severity in Sudanian ecosystems of Burkina Faso using Landsat 8 satellite images,"The fire severity of the 2013–2014 fire season within Sudanian ecosystems in Burkina Faso was evaluated from Landsat 8 images using derivatives of the Normalized Burn Ratio algorithm (NBR). The relationship between the image-derived severity and the field observed severity i.e. Composite Burn Index (CBI) was best described by a nonlinear model of the form y = a + b*EXP(CBI *c) (R2 = 0.66). Classification of the image-derived burned area into burn severity classes achieved a classification Kappa accuracy statistic of 0.56. Highly severely burned areas were mapped with the highest accuracy (user's accuracy 77%, producer's accuracy 86%). The severity of the burn varied across phyto-geographical zones, protected status, land cover regimes, and forest management practices. The south Sudanian zone burned with a higher severity (low = 7%, moderate = 16% and high = 13%) than the north Sudanian zone (low = 5%, moderate = 10% and high = 5%). The mean of the highly severely burned areas differed significantly among the forest management practices (P = 0.005). A pair-wise comparison of the severity mean area indicated that the highly burned areas within forests managed for wildlife purposes differed significantly with that of both forests under the joint management (P = 0.006) and those under no management (P = 0.024). Among the management practices, forests jointly managed by the local communities and the government had the highest unburned area and the least highly severely burned areas reflecting the impacts of bottom-up forestry management where the local communities are actively involved in the management. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Understanding sources of organic aerosol during CalNex-2010 using the CMAQ-VBS,"Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations utilizing the traditional organic aerosol (OA) treatment (CMAQ-AE6) and a volatility basis set (VBS) treatment for OA (CMAQ-VBS) were evaluated against measurements collected at routine monitoring networks (Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) and Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE)) and those collected during the 2010 California at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) field campaign to examine important sources of OA in southern California.<br><br> Traditionally, CMAQ treats primary organic aerosol (POA) as nonvolatile and uses a two-product framework to represent secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. CMAQ-VBS instead treats POA as semivolatile and lumps OA using volatility bins spaced an order of magnitude apart. The CMAQ-VBS approach underpredicted organic carbon (OC) at IMPROVE and CSN sites to a greater degree than CMAQ-AE6 due to the semivolatile POA treatment. However, comparisons to aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements collected at Pasadena, CA, indicated that CMAQ-VBS better represented the diurnal profile and primary/secondary split of OA. CMAQ-VBS SOA underpredicted the average measured AMS oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA, a surrogate for SOA) concentration by a factor of 5.2, representing a considerable improvement to CMAQ-AE6 SOA predictions (factor of 24 lower than AMS).<br><br> We use two new methods, one based on species ratios (SOA/i""CO and SOA/O<i>x</i>) and another on a simplified SOA parameterization, to apportion the SOA underprediction for CMAQ-VBS to slow photochemical oxidation (estimated as 1.5 × lower than observed at Pasadena using ĝ'log(NO<i>x</i>ĝ€:ĝ€NO<i>y</i>)), low intrinsic SOA formation efficiency (low by 1.6 to 2 × for Pasadena), and low emissions or excessive dispersion for the Pasadena site (estimated to be 1.6 to 2.3 × too low/excessive). The first and third factors are common to CMAQ-AE6, while the intrinsic SOA formation efficiency for that model is estimated to be too low by about 7 × .<br><br> From source-apportioned model results, we found most of the CMAQ-VBS modeled POA at the Pasadena CalNex site was attributable to meat cooking emissions (48 %, consistent with a substantial fraction of cooking OA in the observations). This is compared to 18 % from gasoline vehicle emissions, 13 % from biomass burning (in the form of residential wood combustion), and 8 % from diesel vehicle emissions. All ""other"" inventoried emission sources (e.g., industrial, point, and area sources) comprised the final 13 %. The CMAQ-VBS semivolatile POA treatment underpredicted AMS hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) + cooking-influenced OA (CIOA) at Pasadena by a factor of 1.8 compared to a factor of 1.4 overprediction of POA in CMAQ-AE6, but it did capture the AMS diurnal profile of HOA and CIOA well, with the exception of the midday peak.<br><br> Overall, the CMAQ-VBS with its semivolatile treatment of POA, SOA from intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs), and aging of SOA improves SOA model performance (though SOA formation efficiency is still 1.6-2 × too low). However, continued efforts are needed to better understand assumptions in the parameterization (e.g., SOA aging) and provide additional certainty to how best to apply existing emission inventories in a framework that treats POA as semivolatile, which currently degrades existing model performance at routine monitoring networks. The VBS and other approaches (e.g., AE6) require additional work to appropriately incorporate IVOC emissions and subsequent SOA formation. © 2016 Author(s). CC Attribution 3.0 License.",,No,No,No
Source contributions and regional transport of primary particulate matter in China,"A source-oriented CMAQ was applied to determine source sector/region contributions to primary particulate matter (PPM) in China. Four months were simulated with emissions grouped to eight regions and six sectors. Predicted elemental carbon (EC), primary organic carbon (POC), and PPM concentrations and source contributions agree with measurements and have significant spatiotemporal variations. Residential is a major contributor to spring/winter EC (50-80%), POC (60%-90%), and PPM (30-70%). For summer/fall, industrial contributes 30-50% for EC/POC and 40-60% for PPM. Transportation is more important for EC (20-30%) than POC/PPM (<5%). Open burning is important in summer/fall of Guangzhou and Chongqing. Dust contributes to 1/3-1/2 in spring/fall of Beijing, Xi'an and Chongqing. Based on sector-region combination, local residential/transportation and residential/industrial from Heibei are major contributors to spring PPM in Beijing.

Single-particle characterizations of ambient aerosols during a wintertime pollution episode in nanning: Local emissions vs. regional transport,"Ambient aerosol during a heavily polluted episode in wintertime was characterized using real-time single particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS) in urban Nanning, a capital city in the Southwestern China. More than two million individual particles analyzed by SPAMS were classified into 8 major clusters based on the mass spectral patterns. A group of vanadium-rich particles were identified as the emissions from mining and smelting of vanadium mineral and were taken as markers of regional transported industrial emissions when air masses traversed northeast inland regions from Nanning. Number fractions of other industrially-emitted particles, including chromium-rich, elemental/organic carbon, organic carbon and fly ash, also increased during the regional transport events. During stagnant periods, local emissions sources, including vehicle exhaust (like Ca-EC particles) and local coal-fired power plants, contributed to the fine particles. During most of the sampling period, biomass burning particles produced by bagasse combustion were the most abundant, contributing ~25– 80% of the total classified particles. Our observations suggest that biomass burning particles derived from industrial heat and electricity cogeneration processes could have a significant impact on the urban air quality without proper emission controls. © 2017 Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.",,No,No,No
An AERONET-based aerosol classification using the Mahalanobis distance,"We present an aerosol classification based on AERONET aerosol data from 1993 to 2012. We used the AERONET Level 2.0 almucantar aerosol retrieval products to define several reference aerosol clusters which are characteristic of the following general aerosol types: Urban-Industrial, Biomass Burning, Mixed Aerosol, Dust, and Maritime. The classification of a particular aerosol observation as one of these aerosol types is determined by its five-dimensional Mahalanobis distance to each reference cluster. We have calculated the fractional aerosol type distribution at 190 AERONET sites, as well as the monthly variation in aerosol type at those locations. The results are presented on a global map and individually in the supplementary material. Our aerosol typing is based on recognizing that different geographic regions exhibit characteristic aerosol types. To generate reference clusters we only keep data points that lie within a Mahalanobis distance of 2 from the centroid. Our aerosol characterization is based on the AERONET retrieved quantities, therefore it does not include low optical depth values. The analysis is based on ""point sources"" (the AERONET sites) rather than globally distributed values. The classifications obtained will be useful in interpreting aerosol retrievals from satellite borne instruments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,No,No,No
Aerosols at the poles: An AeroCom Phase II multi-model evaluation,"Atmospheric aerosols from anthropogenic and natural sources reach the polar regions through long-range transport and affect the local radiation balance. Such transport is, however, poorly constrained in present-day global climate models, and few multi-model evaluations of polar anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing exist. Here we compare the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm from simulations with 16 global aerosol models from the AeroCom Phase II model intercomparison project with available observations at both poles. We show that the annual mean multi-model median is representative of the observations in Arctic, but that the intermodel spread is large. We also document the geographical distribution and seasonal cycle of the AOD for the individual aerosol species: Black carbon (BC) from fossil fuel and biomass burning, sulfate, organic aerosols (OAs), dust, and sea-salt. For a subset of models that represent nitrate and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), we document the role of these aerosols at high latitudes. The seasonal dependence of natural and anthropogenic aerosols differs with natural aerosols peaking in winter (seasalt) and spring (dust), whereas AOD from anthropogenic aerosols peaks in late spring and summer. The models produce a median annual mean AOD of 0.07 in the Arctic (defined here as north of 60°N). The models also predict a noteworthy aerosol transport to the Antarctic (south of 70°S) with a resulting AOD varying between 0.01 and 0.02. The models have estimated the shortwave anthropogenic radiative forcing contributions to the direct aerosol effect (DAE) associated with BC and OA from fossil fuel and biofuel (FF), sulfate, SOAs, nitrate, and biomass burning from BC and OA emissions combined. The Arctic modelled annual mean DAE is slightly negative (..0.12Wm..2), dominated by a positive BC FF DAE in spring and a negative sulfate DAE in summer. The Antarctic DAE is governed by BC FF. We perform sensitivity experiments with one of the AeroCom models (GISS modelE) to investigate how regional emissions of BC and sulfate and the lifetime of BC influence the Arctic and Antarctic AOD. A doubling of emissions in eastern Asia results in a 33% increase in Arctic AOD of BC. A doubling of the BC lifetime results in a 39% increase in Arctic AOD of BC. However, these radical changes still fall within the AeroCom model range. © 2017 Author(s).",,No,No,No
"Analysis of aerosol composition data for western United States wildfires between 2005 and 2015: Dust emissions, chloride depletion, and most enhanced aerosol constituents","This study examines major wildfires in the western United States between 2005 and 2015 to determine which species exhibit the highest percent change in mass concentration on day of peak fire influence relative to preceding nonfire days. Forty-one fires were examined using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) data set. Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) constituents exhibited the highest percent change increase. The sharpest enhancements were for the volatile (OC1) and semivolatile (OC2) OC fractions, suggestive of secondary organic aerosol formation during plume transport. Of the noncarbonaceous constituents, Cl, P, K, NO3         −, and Zn levels exhibited the highest percent change. Dust was significantly enhanced in wildfire plumes, based on significant enhancements in fine soil components (i.e., Si, Ca, Al, Fe, and Ti) and PMcoarse (i.e., PM10–PM2.5). A case study emphasized how transport of wildfire plumes significantly impacted downwind states, with higher levels of fine soil and PMcoarse at the downwind state (Arizona) as compared to the source of the fires (California). A global model (Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System, NAAPS) did not capture the dust influence over California or Arizona during this case event because it is not designed to resolve dust dynamics in fires, which motivates improved treatment of such processes. Significant chloride depletion was observed on the peak EC day for almost a half of the fires examined. Size-resolved measurements during two specific fires at a coastal California site revealed significant chloride reductions for particle aerodynamic diameters between 1 and 10 μm. ©2017.

Emission factors from different burning stages of agriculture wastes in Mexico,"Open-air burning of agricultural wastes from crops like corn, rice, sorghum, sugar cane, and wheat is common practice in Mexico, which in spite limiting regulations, is the method to eliminate such wastes, to clear the land for further harvesting, to control grasses, weeds, insects, and pests, and to facilitate nutrient absorption. However, this practice generates air pollution and contributes to the greenhouse effect. Burning of straws derived from the said crops was emulated in a controlled combustion chamber, hence determining emission factors for particles, black carbon, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide throughout the process, which comprised three apparent stages: pre-ignition, flaming, and smoldering. In all cases, maximum particle concentrations were observed during the flaming stage, although the maximum final contributions to the particle emission factors corresponded to the smoldering stage. The comparison between particle size distributions (from laser spectrometer) and black carbon (from an aethalometer) confirmed that finest particles were emitted mainly during the flaming stage. Carbon dioxide emissions were also highest during the flaming stage whereas those of carbon monoxide were highest during the smoldering stage. Comparing the emission factors for each straw type with their chemical analyses (elemental, proximate, and biochemical), some correlations were found between lignin content and particle emissions and either particle emissions or duration of the pre-ignition stage. High ash or lignin containing-straw slowed down the pre-ignition and flaming stages, thus favoring CO oxidation to CO2. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",,No,No,No
"Aerosol properties, source identification, and cloud processing in orographic clouds measured by single particle mass spectrometry on a central European mountain site during HCCT-2010","Cloud residues and out-of-cloud aerosol particles with diameters between 150 and 900gnm were analysed by online single particle aerosol mass spectrometry during the 6-week study Hill Cap Cloud Thuringia (HCCT)-2010 in September-October 2010. The measurement location was the mountain Schmücke (937gmga.s.l.) in central Germany. More than 160g000 bipolar mass spectra from out-of-cloud aerosol particles and more than 13g000 bipolar mass spectra from cloud residual particles were obtained and were classified using a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. Analysis of the uncertainty of the sorting algorithm was conducted on a subset of the data by comparing the clustering output with particle-by-particle inspection and classification by the operator. This analysis yielded a false classification probability between 13 and 48g%. Additionally, particle types were identified by specific marker ions. <br><br> The results from the ambient aerosol analysis show that 63g% of the analysed particles belong to clusters having a diurnal variation, suggesting that local or regional sources dominate the aerosol, especially for particles containing soot and biomass burning particles. In the cloud residues, the relative percentage of large soot-containing particles and particles containing amines was found to be increased compared to the out-of-cloud aerosol, while, in general, organic particles were less abundant in the cloud residues. In the case of amines, this can be explained by the high solubility of the amines, while the large soot-containing particles were found to be internally mixed with inorganics, which explains their activation as cloud condensation nuclei. Furthermore, the results show that during cloud processing, both sulfate and nitrate are added to the residual particles, thereby changing the mixing state and increasing the fraction of particles with nitrate and/or sulfate. This is expected to lead to higher hygroscopicity after cloud evaporation, and therefore to an increase of the particles' ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei after their cloud passage. © Author(s) 2016.",,No,No,No
Genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of formic acid on human lymphocytes in vitro,"Objective: Formic acid is an ubiquitous chemical constituent in the environment, being produced by sources as diverse as vegetation, ants, soil, vehicles, biomass burning, and photochemical reactions. The present work is focused on in vitro analysis of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of formic acid, using cytogenetic tests such as the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN) and chromosomal aberration analysis, in human lymphocytes. Method: This study was carried out using blood samples from healthy, non-smoking adults aged 18-22 years, of whom 10 were male and 6 were famale. Different concentrations (0.07, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8 mM) of formic acid was added to the lymphocyte culture test for chromosomal aberration (CA) analysis. Mitomycin-C (0.3 mg/ml) was used as the positive control. Human peripheral blood lymphocyte cells were treated with 20, 40, 60, 80 mM concentrations of formic acid for 48 h. for the CBMN test. Mitomycin-C (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the Lymphocyte culture as a positive control. The present research was carried out to assess the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of formic acid on human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN), as well as chromosomal aberration (CA) analysis. Results: A significant increase was observed for induction of micronucleus frequency in all treatments of formic acid concentrations for 48 h. comparing with the negative control and mitomycin C (MMC, 0.5 μg/ ml) which was used as positive control. When compared with negative control and with mitomycin C (MMC, 0.3 μg/ml) which is used as positive control, it is observed that formic acid is rising the frequency of chromosomal aberration significantly at all appliance concantrations in 24 h. The frequency of micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations increased in a dose dependent manner. The results showed that there were significant correlations between formic acid concentration and micronuclei frequency (r= 0.92), numbers of necrotic cells (r= 0.95), and apoptotic cells (r= 0.91). Conclusion: Our data provided evidence that there is a significant correlation between the concentration of formic acid and the following chromosomal aberrations: frequency of micronuclei, apoptotic cells, and necrotic cells in vitro.",,No,No,No
Characterization of aerosol episodes in the greater Mediterranean Sea area from satellite observations (2000-2007),"An algorithm able to identify and characterize episodes of different aerosol types above sea surfaces of the greater Mediterranean basin (GMB), including the Black Sea and the Atlantic Ocean off the coasts of Iberia and northwest Africa, is presented in this study. Based on this algorithm, five types of intense (strong and extreme) aerosol episodes in the GMB are identified and characterized using daily aerosol optical properties from satellite measurements, namely MODIS-Terra, Earth Probe (EP)-TOMS and OMI-Aura. These aerosol episodes are: (i) biomass-burning/urban-industrial (BU), (ii) desert dust (DD), (iii) dust/sea-salt (DSS), (iv) mixed (MX) and (v) undetermined (UN). The identification and characterization is made with our algorithm using a variety of aerosol properties, namely aerosol optical depth (AOD), Ångström exponent (α), fine fraction (FF), effective radius (reff) and Aerosol Index (AI).During the study period (2000-2007), the most frequent aerosol episodes are DD, observed primarily in the western and central Mediterranean Sea, and off the northern African coasts, 7 times/year for strong episodes and 4 times/year for extreme ones, on average. The DD episodes yield 40% of all types of strong aerosol episodes in the study region, while they account for 71.5% of all extreme episodes. The frequency of occurrence of strong episodes exhibits specific geographical patterns, for example the BU are mostly observed along the coasts of southern Europe and off the Atlantic coasts of Portugal, the MX episodes off the Spanish Mediterranean coast and over the Adriatic and northern Aegean Sea, while the DSS ones over the western and central Mediterranean Sea. On the other hand, the extreme episodes for all but DD aerosol display more patchy spatial patterns. The strong episodes exhibit AOD at 550 nm as high as 1.6 in the southernmost parts of central and eastern Mediterranean Sea, which rise up to 5 for the extreme, mainly DD and DSS, episodes. Although more than 90% of all aerosol episodes last 1 day, there are few cases, mainly extreme DD episodes, which last up to 4 days. Independently of their type, the Mediterranean aerosol episodes occur more frequently in spring (strong and extreme episodes) and summer (strong episodes) and most rarely during winter. A significant year by year variability of Mediterranean aerosol episodes has been identified, more in terms of their frequency than intensity. An analysis of 5-day back trajectories for the most extreme episodes provides confidence on the obtained results of the algorithm, based on the revealed origin and track of air masses causing the episodes. The 25 and 6% of all strong and extreme episodes, respectively, are MX, thus highlighting the co-existence of different aerosol types in the greater Mediterranean. The intensity of both MX and DSS episodes exhibits similar patterns to those of DD strong ones, indicating that desert dust is a determinant factor for the intensity of aerosol episodes in the Mediterranean, including DSS and MX episodes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,No,No,No
Molecular corridors and parameterizations of volatility in the chemical evolution of organic aerosols,"The formation and aging of organic aerosols (OA) proceed through multiple steps of chemical reaction and mass transport in the gas and particle phases, which is challenging for the interpretation of field measurements and laboratory experiments as well as accurate representation of OA evolution in atmospheric aerosol models. Based on data from over 30g€¯000 compounds, we show that organic compounds with a wide variety of functional groups fall into molecular corridors, characterized by a tight inverse correlation between molar mass and volatility. We developed parameterizations to predict the saturation mass concentration of organic compounds containing oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur from the elemental composition that can be measured by soft-ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry. Field measurement data from new particle formation events, biomass burning, cloud/fog processing, and indoor environments were mapped into molecular corridors to characterize the chemical nature of the observed OA components. We found that less-oxidized indoor OA are constrained to a corridor of low molar mass and high volatility, whereas highly oxygenated compounds in atmospheric water extend to high molar mass and low volatility. Among the nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds identified in atmospheric aerosols, amines tend to exhibit low molar mass and high volatility, whereas organonitrates and organosulfates follow high O : C corridors extending to high molar mass and low volatility. We suggest that the consideration of molar mass and molecular corridors can help to constrain volatility and particle-phase state in the modeling of OA particularly for nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds. © Author(s) 2016.",,No,No,No
Hygroscopic properties of potassium chloride and its internal mixtures with organic compounds relevant to biomass burning aerosol particles,"While water uptake of aerosols exerts considerable impacts on climate, the effects of aerosol composition and potential interactions between species on hygroscopicity of atmospheric particles have not been fully characterized. The water uptake behaviors of potassium chloride and its internal mixtures with water soluble organic compounds (WSOCs) related to biomass burning aerosols including oxalic acid, levoglucosan and humic acid at different mass ratios were investigated using a hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA). Deliquescence points of KCl/organic mixtures were observed to occur at lower RH values and over a broader RH range eventually disappearing at high organic mass fractions. This leads to substantial under-prediction of water uptake at intermediate RH. Large discrepancies for water content between model predictions and measurements were observed for KCl aerosols with 75 wt% oxalic acid content, which is likely due to the formation of less hygroscopic potassium oxalate from interactions between KCl and oxalic acid without taken into account in the model methods. Our results also indicate strong influence of levoglucosan on hygroscopic behaviors of multicomponent mixed particles. These findings are important in further understanding the role of interactions between WSOCs and inorganic salt on hygroscopic behaviors and environmental effects of atmospheric particles. © The Author(s) 2017.",,No,No,No
Global combustion: The connection between fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions (1997–2010),"Humans use combustion for heating and cooking, managing lands, and, more recently, for fuelling the industrial economy. As a shift to fossil-fuel-based energy occurs, we expect that anthropogenic biomass burning in open landscapes will decline as it becomes less fundamental to energy acquisition and livelihoods. Using global data on both fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions, we tested this relationship over a 14 year period (1997–2010). The global average annual carbon emissions from biomass burning during this time were 2.2 Pg C per year (±0.3 s.d.), approximately one-third of fossil fuel emissions over the same period (7.3 Pg C, ±0.8 s.d.). There was a significant inverse relationship between average annual fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions. Fossil fuel emissions explained 8% of the variation in biomass burning emissions at a global scale, but this varied substantially by land cover. For example, fossil fuel burning explained 31% of the variation in biomass burning in woody savannas, but was a non-significant predictor for evergreen needle leaf forests. In the land covers most dominated by human use, croplands and urban areas, fossil fuel emissions were more than 30- and 500- fold greater than biomass burning emissions. This relationship suggests that combustion practices may be shifting from open landscape burning to contained combustion for industrial purposes, and highlights the need to take into account how humans appropriate combustion in global modelling of contemporary fire. Industrialized combustion is not only an important driver of atmospheric change, but also an important driver of landscape change through companion declines in human-started fires. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Graphical aerosol classification method using aerosol relative optical depth,"A simple graphical method is presented to classify aerosol types based on a combination of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and aerosol relative optical thickness (AROT). Six aerosol types, including maritime (MA), desert dust (DD), continental (CO), sub-continental (SC), urban industry (UI) and biomass burning (BB), are discriminated in a two dimensional space of AOT440 and AROT1020/440. Numerical calculations are performed using MIE theory based on a multi log-normal particle size distribution, and the AROT ranges for each aerosol type are determined. More than 5 years of daily observations from 8 representative aerosol sites are applied to the method to confirm spatial applicability. Finally, 3 individual cases are analyzed according to their specific aerosol status. The outcomes indicate that the new graphical method coordinates well with regional characteristics and is also able to distinguish aerosol variations in individual situations. This technique demonstrates a novel way to estimate different aerosol types and provide information on radiative forcing calculations and satellite data corrections. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,No,No,No
Simulations of the effect of intensive biomass burning in July 2015 on Arctic radiative budget,"The impact of biomass burning (BB) on aerosol optical properties and radiative budget in the polar region following an intense boreal fire event in North America in July 2015 is explored in this paper. Presented data are obtained from the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) reanalysis and the Fu-Liou radiative transfer model. NAAPS provides particle concentrations and aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 1° x 1° spatial and 6-hourly temporal resolution, its AOD and vertical profiles were validated with field measurements for this event. Direct aerosol radiative forcings (ARF) at the surface, the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and within the atmosphere are calculated for clear-sky and all-sky conditions, with the surface albedo and cloud properties constrained by satellite retrievals. The mean ARFs at the surface, the TOA, and within the atmosphere averaged for the north pole region (latitudes north of 75.5N) and the study period (July 5–15, 2015) are −13.1 ± 2.7, 0.3 ± 2.1, and 13.4 ± 2.7 W/m2 for clear-sky and −7.3 ± 1.8, 5.0 ± 2.6, and 12.3 ± 1.6 W/m2 for all-sky conditions respectively. Local ARFs can be a several times larger e.g. the clear-sky surface and TOA ARF reach over Alaska −85 and −30 W/m2 and over Svalbard −41 and −20 W/m2 respectively. The ARF is found negative at the surface (almost zero over high albedo region though) with the maximum forcing over the BB source region, and weaker forcing under all-sky conditions compared to the clear-sky conditions. Unlike the ARFs at the surface and within the atmosphere, which have consistent forcing signs all over the polar region, the ARF at the TOA changes signs from negative (cooling) over the source region (Alaska) to positive (heating) over bright surfaces (e.g., Greenland) because of strong surface albedo effect. NAAPS simulations also show that the transported BB particle over the Arctic are in the low-to-middle troposphere and above low-level clouds, resulting in little difference in ARFs at the TOA between clear- and all-sky conditions over the regions with high surface albedo. Over dark surfaces, the negative TOA forcing increases with AOD about 50% slower under all-sky conditions compared to clear-sky case. The boreal BB event resulted in large magnitude of ARFs and the high variabilities of the forcings over the polar region has a significant impact on the polar weather conditions and important implications for the polar climate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
"Daily personal exposure of women cooks to respirable particulate matters during cooking with solid bio-fuels in a rural community of West Bengal, India","About 60% of the Indian population are still relying on the traditional bio-fuels comprising of firewood, cow dung cake, crop residue etc. More than 85% of the rural households use these unprocessed bio-fuels for cooking purposes. Biomass fuel burning in daily cooking with traditional inefficient earthen stoves, in an un-vented kitchen, usually emits very high levels of smoke containing a complex mixture of a wide array of potentially hazardous pollutants, especially, particulate matters of varying size range. Size smaller than the PM10 particles, can penetrate further deep into the gas exchange region of the lungs and are termed as the respirable particulate matter with 50% cut point at 4 μm. Respirable particulate exposure assessment is particularly important in case of health hazard explanation because it can enter into the deepest of the lungs. Personal exposures to respirable particulate matters were assessed during cooking hours in the varied opened kitchens, considering the seasonal change and the meal preparation as covariates. Maximum variability for the particulate exposures was observed in the kitchens with openness range of 15–60%. Greater particulate exposures were found in the least opened kitchens. Two-way ANCOVA showed significant impact of seasonal change on the differential opened kitchens for personal exposure to respirable particulate matters. Tukey post hoc test reveals significant mean differences of respirable particulates in all pair-wise seasonal combinations and in all the pair-wise openness type combinations except for the < 15% and 15–30% opened kitchens. Winter season came out to be one of the significant predictor for the personal exposure prediction model. Across all the seasons and kitchen openness, average exposure concentration of the respirable particulate matters was 1445 μg m–3. © 2017 Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.",,No,No,No
Multi-sensor cloud and aerosol retrieval simulator and remote sensing from model parameters-Part 2: Aerosols,"The Multi-sensor Cloud Retrieval Simulator (MCRS) produces a ""simulated radiance"" product from any high-resolution general circulation model with interactive aerosol as if a specific sensor such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were viewing a combination of the atmospheric column and land-ocean surface at a specific location. Previously the MCRS code only included contributions from atmosphere and clouds in its radiance calculations and did not incorporate properties of aerosols. In this paper we added a new aerosol properties module to the MCRS code that allows users to insert a mixture of up to 15 different aerosol species in any of 36 vertical layers.This new MCRS code is now known as MCARS (Multi-sensor Cloud and Aerosol Retrieval Simulator). Inclusion of an aerosol module into MCARS not only allows for extensive, tightly controlled testing of various aspects of satellite operational cloud and aerosol properties retrieval algorithms, but also provides a platform for comparing cloud and aerosol models against satellite measurements. This kind of two-way platform can improve the efficacy of model parameterizations of measured satellite radiances, allowing the assessment of model skill consistently with the retrieval algorithm. The MCARS code provides dynamic controls for appearance of cloud and aerosol layers. Thereby detailed quantitative studies of the impacts of various atmospheric components can be controlled.In this paper we illustrate the operation of MCARS by deriving simulated radiances from various data field output by the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) model. The model aerosol fields are prepared for translation to simulated radiance using the same model subgrid variability parameterizations as are used for cloud and atmospheric properties profiles, namely the ICA technique. After MCARS computes modeled sensor radiances equivalent to their observed counterparts, these radiances are presented as input to operational remote-sensing algorithms.Specifically, the MCARS-computed radiances are input into the processing chain used to produce the MODIS Data Collection 6 aerosol product (M{O/Y}D04). The M{O/Y}D04 product is of course normally produced from M{O/Y}D021KM MODIS Level-1B radiance product directly acquired by the MODIS instrument. MCARS matches the format and metadata of a M{O/Y}D021KM product. The resulting MCARS output can be directly provided to MODAPS (MODIS Adaptive Processing System) as input to various operational atmospheric retrieval algorithms. Thus the operational algorithms can be tested directly without needing to make any software changes to accommodate an alternative input source.We show direct application of this synthetic product in analysis of the performance of the MOD04 operational algorithm. We use biomass-burning case studies over Amazonia employed in a recent Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE)-sponsored study of aerosol impacts on numerical weather prediction (Freitas et al., 2015). We demonstrate that a known low bias in retrieved MODIS aerosol optical depth appears to be due to a disconnect between actual column relative humidity and the value assumed by the MODIS aerosol product. © 2016 Author(s).",,No,No,No
"Characterization of aerosol optical properties using multiple clustering techniques over Zanjan, Iran, during 2010–2013","Discrimination of aerosol types is very important, because different aerosols are created from diverse sources having different chemical, physical, and optical properties. In the present study, we have analyzed the seasonal classification of aerosol types by multiple clustering techniques, using AERosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) data during 2010–2013 over Zanjan, Iran. We found that aerosol optical depth (AOD) showed pronounced seasonal variations of a summer high and winter low. Conversely, the values of the Angstrom exponent (AE) in winter and fall were higher than in spring and summer, which confirmed the presence of fine particles, while the low value of AE in the summer and spring represented the existence of coarse particles. Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) variations revealed the presence of scattering aerosols like dust in spring, summer, and fall while the dominance of absorbing-type aerosols in winter were also observed. The influence of local anthropogenic activities has caused a higher concentration of fine aerosols, and a higher fine mode fraction (FMF) of AOD in winter was recorded. Classification of aerosol types was carried out by analyzing different aerosol properties such as AOD versus AE, extinction Angstrom exponent (EAE) versus SSA, EAE versus absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE), FMF AOD versus EAE, and SSA versus FMF AOD. The analysis revealed the presence of dust and polluted dust in spring, summer, and fall in the atmosphere of Zanjan. Urban/industrial aerosols were available in all seasons, especially in fall and winter. The mixed aerosols existed in all seasons over the study location; however, no biomass burning aerosols were found. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) aerosol subtype profiles showed the dominance of dust and polluted dust in spring and summer. However, the presence of polluted dust and industrial smoke during fall and winter were also noted over the study site. © 2018 Optical Society of America.",,No,No,No
Constraining a hybrid volatility basis-set model for aging of wood-burning emissions using smog chamber experiments: A box-model study based on the VBS scheme of the CAMx model (v5.40),"In this study, novel wood combustion aging experiments performed at different temperatures (263 and 288 K) in a ∼7m3 smog chamber were modelled using a hybrid volatility basis set (VBS) box model, representing the emission partitioning and their oxidation against OH. We combine aerosol chemistry box-model simulations with unprecedented measurements of non-Traditional volatile organic compounds (NTVOCs) from a high-resolution proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) and with organic aerosol measurements from an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). Due to this, we are able to observationally constrain the amounts of different NTVOC aerosol precursors (in the model) relative to low volatility and semi-volatile primary organic material (OMsv/, which is partitioned based on current published volatility distribution data. By comparing the NTVOC=OMsv ratios at different temperatures, we determine the enthalpies of vaporization of primary biomassburning organic aerosols. Further, the developed model allows for evaluating the evolution of oxidation products of the semi-volatile and volatile precursors with aging. More than 30 000 box-model simulations were performed to retrieve the combination of parameters that best fit the observed organic aerosol mass and O: C ratios. The parameters investigated include the NTVOC reaction rates and yields as well as enthalpies of vaporization and the O: C of secondary organic aerosol surrogates. Our results suggest an average ratio of NTVOCs to the sum of non-volatile and semivolatile organic compounds of ∼4.75. The mass yields of these compounds determined for a wide range of atmospherically relevant temperatures and organic aerosol (OA) concentrations were predicted to vary between 8 and 30% after 5 h of continuous aging. Based on the reaction scheme used, reaction rates of the NTVOC mixture range from 3:0×10-11 to 4:0×10-11 cm3 molec-1 s-1. The average enthalpy of vaporization of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) surrogates was determined to be between 55 000 and 35 000 J mol-1, which implies a yield increase of 0.03 0.06%K-1 with decreasing temperature. The improved VBS scheme is suitable for implementation into chemical transport models to predict the burden and oxidation state of primary and secondary biomass-burning aerosols. © Author(s) 2017.

"Climate, CO2 and human population impacts on global wildfire emissions","Wildfires are by far the largest contributor to global biomass burning and constitute a large global source of atmospheric traces gases and aerosols. Such emissions have a considerable impact on air quality and constitute a major health hazard. Biomass burning also influences the radiative balance of the atmosphere and is thus not only of societal, but also of significant scientific interest. There is a common perception that climate change will lead to an increase in emissions as hot and dry weather events that promote wildfire will become more common. However, even though a few studies have found that the inclusion of CO2 fertilisation of photosynthesis and changes in human population patterns will tend to somewhat lower predictions of future wildfire emissions, no such study has included full ensemble ranges of both climate predictions and population projections, including the effect of different degrees of urbanisation. Here, we present a series of 124 simulations with the LPJ-GUESS-SIMFIRE global dynamic vegetation-wildfire model, including a semi-empirical formulation for the prediction of burned area based on fire weather, fuel continuity and human population density. The simulations use Climate Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) climate predictions from eight Earth system models. These were combined with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and five scenarios of future human population density based on the series of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to assess the sensitivity of emissions to the effect of climate, CO2 and humans. In addition, two alternative parameterisations of the semi-empirical burned-area model were applied. Contrary to previous work, we find no clear future trend of global wildfire emissions for the moderate emissions and climate change scenario based on the RCP 4.5. Only historical population change introduces a decline by around 15% since 1900. Future emissions could either increase for low population growth and fast urbanisation, or continue to decline for high population growth and slow urbanisation. Only for high future climate change (RCP8.5), wildfire emissions start to rise again after ca. 2020 but are unlikely to reach the levels of 1900 by the end of the 21st century. We find that climate warming will generally increase the risk of fire, but that this is only one of several equally important factors driving future levels of wildfire emissions, which include population change, CO2 fertilisation causing woody thickening, increased productivity and fuel load and faster litter turnover in a warmer climate. © 2016 Author(s).",,No,No,No
"Optical, microphysical and radiative properties of aerosols over a tropical rural site in Kenya, East Africa: Source identification, modification and aerosol type discrimination","A better understanding of aerosol optical, microphysical and radiative properties is a crucial challenge for climate change studies. In the present study, column-integrated aerosol optical and radiative properties observed at a rural site, Mbita (0.42°S, 34.20 °E, and 1125 m above sea level) located in Kenya, East Africa (EA) are investigated using ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data retrieved during January, 2007 to December, 2015. The annual mean aerosol optical depth (AOD500 nm), Ångström exponent (AE440–870 nm), fine mode fraction of AOD500 nm (FMF500 nm), and columnar water vapor (CWV, cm) were found to be 0.23 ± 0.08, 1.01 ± 0.16, 0.60 ± 0.07, and 2.72 ± 0.20, respectively. The aerosol optical properties exhibited a unimodal distribution with substantial seasonal heterogeneity in their peak values being low (high) during the local wet (dry) seasons. The observed data showed that Mbita and its environs are significantly influenced by various types of aerosols, with biomass burning and/or urban-industrial (BUI), mixed (MXD), and desert dust (DDT) aerosol types contributing to 37.72%, 32.81%, and 1.40%, respectively during the local dry season (JJA). The aerosol volume size distribution (VSD) exhibited bimodal lognormal structure with a geometric mean radius of 0.15 μm and 3.86–5.06 μm for fine- and coarse-mode aerosols, respectively. Further, analysis of single scattering albedo (SSA), asymmetry parameter (ASY) and refractive index (RI) revealed dominance of fine-mode absorbing aerosols during JJA. The averaged aerosol direct radiative forcing (ARF) retrieved from the AERONET showed a strong cooling effect at the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA) and significant warming within the atmosphere (ATM), representing the important role of aerosols played in this rural site of Kenya. Finally, the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model revealed that aerosols from distinct sources resulted in enhanced loading during JJA. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,No,No,No
Toxic organic substances and marker compounds in size-segregated urban particulate matter - Implications for involvement in the in vitro bioactivity of the extractable organic matter,"Toxic organic substances and polar organic marker compounds, i.e. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their nitro-derivatives (N-PAHs), as well as dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) and sugars/sugar anhydrites (S/SAs) were analyzed in size-segregated PM samples (<0.49, 0.49–0.97, 0.97–3 and >3 μm) collected at two urban sites (urban traffic and urban background) during the cold and the warm season. The potential associations between the organic PM determinants and the adverse cellular effects (i.e. cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, DNA damage, oxidative DNA adduct formation, and inflammatory response) induced by the extractable organic matter (EOM) of PM, previously measured in Velali et al. (2016b), were investigated by bivariate correlations and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Partial Least Square regression analysis (PLS) was also employed in order to identify the chemical classes mainly involved in the EOM-induced toxicological endpoints in the various particle size fractions. Results indicated that particle size range <0.49 μm was the major carrier of PM mass and organic compounds at both sites. All toxic organic compounds exhibited higher concentrations at the urban traffic site, except PCBs and OCPs that did not exhibit intra-urban variations. Conversely, wintertime levels of levoglucosan were significantly higher at the urban background site as a result of residential biomass burning. The PLS regression analysis allowed quite good prediction of the EOM-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity based on the determined organic chemical classes, particularly for the finest size fraction of PM. Nevertheless, it is expected that other chemical constituents, not determined here, also contribute to the measured toxicological responses. © 2017",,No,No,No
Indian emissions of technology-linked NMVOCs with chemical speciation: An evaluation of the SAPRC99 mechanism with WRF-CAMx simulations,"Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are important precursors to reactions producing tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosols. The present work uses a detailed technology-linked NMVOC emission database for India, along with a standard mapping method to measured NMVOC profiles, to develop speciated NMVOC emissions, which are aggregated into multiple chemical mechanisms used in chemical transport models. The fully speciated NMVOC emissions inventory with 423 constituent species, was regrouped into model-ready reactivity classes of the RADM2, SAPRC99 and CB-IV chemical mechanisms, and spatially distributed at 25 × 25 km2 resolution, using source-specific spatial proxies. Emissions were considered from four major sectors, i.e. industry, transport, agriculture and residential and from non-combustion activities (use of solvents and paints). It was found that residential cooking with biomass fuels, followed by agricultural residue burning in fields and on-road transport, were largest contributors to the highest reactivity group of NMVOC emissions from India. The emissions were evaluated using WRF-CAMx simulations, using the SAPRC99 photochemical mechanism, over India for contrasting months of April, July and October 2010. Modelled columnar abundance of NO2, CO and O3 agreed well with satellite observations both in magnitude and spatial distribution, in the three contrasting months. Evaluation of monthly and spatial differences between model predictions and observations indicates the need for further refinement of the spatial distribution of NOX emissions, spatio-temporal distribution of agricultural residue burning emissions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,No,No,No
Fire frequency drives decadal changes in soil carbon and nitrogen and ecosystem productivity,"Fire frequency is changing globally and is projected to affect the global carbon cycle and climate. However, uncertainty about how ecosystems respond to decadal changes in fire frequency makes it difficult to predict the effects of altered fire regimes on the carbon cycle; for instance, we do not fully understand the long-term effects of fire on soil carbon and nutrient storage, or whether fire-driven nutrient losses limit plant productivity. Here we analyse data from 48 sites in savanna grasslands, broadleaf forests and needleleaf forests spanning up to 65 years, during which time the frequency of fires was altered at each site. We find that frequently burned plots experienced a decline in surface soil carbon and nitrogen that was non-saturating through time, having 36 per cent (±13 per cent) less carbon and 38 per cent (±16 per cent) less nitrogen after 64 years than plots that were protected from fire. Fire-driven carbon and nitrogen losses were substantial in savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests, but not in temperate and boreal needleleaf forests. We also observe comparable soil carbon and nitrogen losses in an independent field dataset and in dynamic model simulations of global vegetation. The model study predicts that the long-term losses of soil nitrogen that result from more frequent burning may in turn decrease the carbon that is sequestered by net primary productivity by about 20 per cent of the total carbon that is emitted from burning biomass over the same period. Furthermore, we estimate that the effects of changes in fire frequency on ecosystem carbon storage may be 30 per cent too low if they do not include multidecadal changes in soil carbon, especially in drier savanna grasslands. Future changes in fire frequency may shift ecosystem carbon storage by changing soil carbon pools and nitrogen limitations on plant growth, altering the carbon sink capacity of frequently burning savanna grasslands and broadleaf forests. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Size-resolved aerosol and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) properties in the remote marine South China Sea-Part 1: Observations and source classification,"Ship-based measurements of aerosol and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) properties are presented for 2 weeks of observations in remote marine regions of the South China Sea/East Sea during the southwestern monsoon (SWM) season. Smoke from extensive biomass burning throughout the Maritime Continent advected into this region during the SWM, where it was mixed with anthropogenic continental pollution and emissions from heavy shipping activities. Eight aerosol types were identified using a k-means cluster analysis with data from a size-resolved CCN characterization system. Interpretation of the clusters was supplemented by additional onboard aerosol and meteorological measurements, satellite, and model products for the region. A typical bimodal marine boundary layer background aerosol population was identified and observed mixing with accumulation mode aerosol from other sources, primarily smoke from fires in Borneo and Sumatra. Hygroscopicity was assessed using the κ parameter and was found to average 0.40 for samples dominated by aged accumulation mode smoke; 0.65 for accumulation mode marine aerosol; 0.60 in an anthropogenic aerosol plume; and 0.22 during a short period that was characterized by elevated levels of volatile organic compounds not associated with biomass burning impacts. As a special subset of the background marine aerosol, clean air masses substantially scrubbed of particles were observed following heavy precipitation or the passage of squall lines, with changes in observed aerosol properties occurring on the order of minutes. Average CN number concentrations, size distributions, and κ values are reported for each population type, along with CCN number concentrations for particles that activated at supersaturations between 0.14 and 0.85%. © 2017 The Author(s).",,No,No,No
Method to establish the emission inventory of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds in China and its application in the period 2008-2012,"A method was developed to establish a comprehensive anthropogenic VOC emission inventory in China, in which a four-level source categorization was proposed, and an emission factor determination system together with a reference database were developed. And this was applied to establish VOC emission inventories for the period 2008-2012. Results show China's anthropogenic VOC emissions increased from 22.45 Tg in 2008 to 29.85 Tg in 2012 at an annual average rate of 7.38%, with Shandong, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Hebei provinces being the largest emitters. Industrial processes, transportation and solvent utilization were the key sources, accounting for 39.3%, 25.6%, and 14.9% of the total emissions in 2012, respectively. Passenger cars, biofuel combustion, coke production, field burning of biomass, and raw chemical manufacturing were the primary VOC sources nationwide. The key sources for each province were different because of the disparate industry and energy structure. China's VOC emissions displayed remarkable spatial variation, with emissions in the east and southeast regions being much larger than in the northwest, and the high emission areas mainly centered in the Bohai Economic Rim, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the Sichuan Basin. The size of high emission areas expanded over the period 2008-2012, with heavily polluted city clusters gradually emerging. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,No,No,No
Size-segregated sugar composition of transported dust aerosols from Middle-East over Delhi during March 2012,"During March 20–22, 2012 Delhi experienced a massive dust-storm which originated in Middle-East. Size segregated sampling of these dust aerosols was performed using a nine staged Andersen sampler (5 sets of samples were collected including before dust-storm (BDS)), dust-storm day 1 to 3 (DS1 to DS3) and after dust storm (ADS). Sugars (mono and disaccharides, sugar-alcohols and anhydro-sugars) were determined using GC–MS technique. It was observed that on the onset of dust-storm, total suspended particulate matter (TSPM, sum of all stages) concentration in DS1 sample increased by > 2.5 folds compared to that of BDS samples. Interestingly, fine particulate matter (sum of stages with cutoff size < 2.1 μm) loading in DS1 also increased by > 2.5 folds as compared to that of BDS samples. Sugars analyzed in DS1 coarse mode (sum of stages with cutoff size > 2.1 μm) samples showed a considerable increase (~ 1.7–2.8 folds) compared to that of other samples. It was further observed that mono-saccharides, disaccharides and sugar-alcohols concentrations were enhanced in giant (> 9.0 μm) particles in DS1 samples as compared to other samples. On the other hand, anhydro-sugars comprised ~ 13–27% of sugars in coarse mode particles and were mostly found in fine mode constituting ~ 66–85% of sugars in all the sample types. Trehalose showed an enhanced (~ 2–4 folds) concentration in DS1 aerosol samples in both coarse (62.80 ng/m3) and fine (8.57 ng/m3) mode. This increase in Trehalose content in both coarse and fine mode suggests their origin to the transported desert dust and supports their candidature as an organic tracer for desert dust entrainments. Further, levoglucosan to mannosan (L/M) ratios which have been used to predict the type of biomass burning influences on aerosols are found to be size dependent in these samples. These ratios are higher for fine mode particles, hence should be used with caution while interpreting the sources using this tool. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,No,No,No
Source apportionment coupled with gas/particle partitioning theory and risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons associated with size-segregated airborne particulate matter,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured in airborne particulate matter (PM) collected by an eight-stage (S0, S1, ..., S7, and SF) particle sizing sampler in three sampling periods, 85 h (85-h) each period. The measured particle-phase PAHs (P-only) data set and the sum of predicted gas-phase and measured particle phase PAHs (predicted G + P) data set considering the effect of gas/particle partitioning were used in positive matrix factorization (PMF) for source apportionment. Benzo[a]pyrene equivalent concentration (BaPeq) and incremental life cancer risk (ILCR) model were utilized for risk assessment of PAHs. The average concentrations of 85-h PM10 and PM2.1 were 292.729 and 142.642 μg/m3, respectively. The average concentration of 15 PAHs was 480.777 ng/m3 in PM10 and 254.464 ng/m3 in PM2.1. PAHs showed unimodal distribution among the nine sampling stages and S5 collected the most concentrations of PAHs and PM. PAHs with over four aromatic rings tended to accumulate in fine PM especially in S5 and S6 while PAHs with less than four rings preferred to stay in coarse PM especially in S0. A four source profiles for P-only were identified by PMF as follows with their source contributions: biomass burning (BB) (9.580 %), coal combustion (CC) (10.600 %), ""air-surface exchange"" (20.160 %), and vehicle emission (VE) (59.660 %). However, three source profiles for predicted G + P only identified including BB (93.330 %), CC (0.0600 %), and VE (6.610 %). The average 85-h average total BaPeq of 15 PAHs was 5.226 g/m3. S4, S5, and S6 had BaPeq concentrations greater than domestic standard concentration and ILCR value higher than 10-6. © 2016 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,No,No,No
Impact of biomass burning emission on total peroxy nitrates: Fire plume identification during the BORTAS campaign,"Total peroxy nitrate ( ∑PN) concentrations have been measured using a thermal dissociation laser-induced fluorescence (TD-LIF) instrument during the BORTAS campaign, which focused on the impact of boreal biomass burning (BB) emissions on air quality in the Northern Hemisphere. The strong correlation observed between the ∑PN concentrations and those of carbon monoxide (CO), a well-known pyrogenic tracer, suggests the possible use of the ∑PN concentrations as marker of the BB plumes. Two methods for the identification of BB plumes have been applied: (1) ∑PN concentrations higher than 6 times the standard deviation above the background and (2) ∑PN concentrations higher than the 99th percentile of the ∑PNs measured during a background flight (B625); then we compared the percentage of BB plume selected using these methods with the percentage evaluated, applying the approaches usually used in literature. Moreover, adding the pressure threshold (∼750hPa) as ancillary parameter to ∑PNs, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and CO, the BB plume identification is improved. A recurrent artificial neural network (ANN) model was adapted to simulate the concentrations of ∑PNs and HCN, including nitrogen oxide (NO), acetonitrile (CH3CN), CO, ozone (O3) and atmospheric pressure as input parameters, to verify the specific role of these input data to better identify BB plumes. © Author(s) 2016.",,No,No,No
Carbon isotope-constrained seasonality of carbonaceous aerosol sources from an urban location (Kanpur) in the Indo-Gangetic Plain,"The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in northern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh is a major source of carbonaceous aerosols in South Asia. However, poorly constrained seasonality of their sources over the IGP leads to large uncertainty in climate and health effects. Here we present a first data set for year-round radiocarbon (δ14C) and stable carbon (σ13C)-based source apportionment of total carbon (TC) in ambient PM10 (n = 17) collected from an urban site (Kanpur: 26.5°N, 80.3°E) in the IGP during January 2007 to January 2008. The year-round 14C-based fraction biomass (fbio-TC) estimate at Kanpur averages ~77 ± 7% and emphasizes an impact of biomass burning emissions (BBEs). The highest fbio-TC (%) is observed in fall season (October-November, 85 ± 6%) followed by winter (December-February, 80 ± 4%) and spring (March-May, 75 ± 8%), while lowest values are found in summer (June-September, 69 ± 2%). Since biomass/coal combustion and vehicular emissions mostly contribute to carbonaceous aerosols over the IGP, we predict σ13CTC (σ13Cpred) over Kanpur using known σ13C source signatures and the measured δ14C value of each sample. The seasonal variability of σ13Cobs - σ13Cpred versus δ14CTC together with air mass back trajectories and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer fire count data reveal that carbonaceous aerosols in winter/fall are significantly influenced by atmospheric aging (downwind transport of crop residue burning/wood combustion emissions in the northern IGP), while local sources (wheat residue combustion/vehicular emissions) dominate in spring/summer. Given the large temporal and seasonal variability in sources and emission strength of TC over the IGP, 14C-based constraints are, thus, crucial for reducing their uncertainties in carbonaceous aerosol budgets in climate models. © 2017.

Classification of aerosols in an urban environment on the basis of optical measurements,"The present study investigates various types of aerosol in the Lahore city of Pakistan using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data over a six year period from 2007 to 2012. Aerosol optical depths (AODs) observed was in the range 0.2–1.12. An analysis of seasonal variations in AOD has indicated that the highest AOD values occurred in summer and the lowest in winter. The urban aerosols of the study area were classified on the basis of optical parameters such as AOD, Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE), Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), Asymmetry Parameter (ASY) and Refractive Index (RI). The AAE values were in the range from 0.25 to 3.2. Real Refractive Index (RRI) and Imaginary part of the Refractive Index (IRI) values were in the range from 1.5 to 1.6 and 0 to 0.005 respectively. The major contributions to the atmospheric aerosols over Lahore were from urban industrial emissions, fossil fuel burning and road/soil dust. Higher RRI values reflected larger re-suspended road dust particles and long-range transported particles, while lower values reflected increased anthropogenic absorbing carbonaceous aerosols over the area. The AERONET retrieved SSA (0.80–0.89) and ASY (0.70–0.83) values suggested a predominance of urban industrial, vehicular and dust aerosols over Lahore. The Derivative of Angstrom Exponent (DAE) was derived at a wavelength of 500 nm and was found to indicate a predominance of fine aerosols across all seasons, particularly during summer and autumn seasons. Back-trajectory analyses using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model revealed that the major air masses over Lahore originated from India, Iran and Afghanistan. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.",,No,No,No
Impacts of weather on long-term patterns of plant richness and diversity vary with location and management,"Better understanding the influence of precipitation and temperature on plant assemblages is needed to predict the effects of climate change. Many studies have examined the relationship between plant productivity and weather (primarily precipitation), but few have directly assessed the relationship between plant richness or diversity and weather despite their increased use as metrics of ecosystem condition. We focus on the grasslands of central North America, which are characterized by high temporal climatic variability. Over the next 100 years, these grasslands are predicted to experience further increased variability in growing season precipitation, as well as increased temperatures, due to global climate change. We assess the portion of interannual variability of richness and diversity explained by weather, how relationships between these metrics and weather vary among plant assemblages, and which aspects of weather best explain temporal variability. We used an information-theoretic approach to assess relationships between long-term plant richness and diversity patterns and a priori weather covariates using six data sets from four grasslands. Weather explained up to 49% and 63% of interannual variability in total plant species richness and diversity, respectively. However, richness and diversity responses to specific weather variables varied both among sites and among experimental treatments within sites. In general, we found many instances in which temperature was of equal or greater importance as precipitation, as well as evidence of the importance of lagged effects and precipitation or temperature variability. Although precipitation has been shown to be a key driver of productivity in grasslands, our results indicate that increasing temperatures alone, without substantial changes in precipitation patterns, could have measurable effects on Great Plains grassland plant assemblages and biodiversity metrics. Our results also suggest that richness and diversity will respond in unique ways to changing climate and management can affect these responses; additional research and monitoring will be essential for further understanding of these complex relationships. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.",,No,No,No
Sources of ultrafine particles in the Eastern United States,"Source contributions to ultrafine particle number concentrations for a summertime period in the Eastern U.S. are investigated using the chemical transport model PMCAMx-UF. New source-resolved number emissions inventories are developed for biomass burning, dust, gasoline automobiles, industrial sources, non-road and on-road diesel. According to the inventory for this summertime period in the Eastern U.S., gasoline automobiles are responsible for 40% of the ultrafine particle number emissions, followed by industrial sources (33%), non-road diesel (16%), on-road diesel (10%), and 1% from biomass burning and dust. With these emissions as input, the chemical transport model PMCAMx-UF reproduces observed ultrafine particle number concentrations (N3-100) in Pittsburgh with an error of 12%. For this summertime period in the Eastern U.S., nucleation is predicted to be the source of more than 90% of the total particle number concentrations. The source contributions to primary particle number concentrations are on average similar to those of their source emissions contributions: gasoline is predicted to contribute 36% of the total particle number concentrations, followed by industrial sources (31%), non-road diesel (18%), on-road diesel (10%), biomass burning (1%), and long-range transport (4%). For this summertime period in Pittsburgh, number source apportionment predictions for particles larger than 3nm in diameter (traffic 65%, other combustion sources 35%) are consistent with measurement-based source apportionment (traffic 60%, combustion sources 40%). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,No,No,No
Using the OMI aerosol index and absorption aerosol optical depth to evaluate the NASA MERRA Aerosol Reanalysis,"A radiative transfer interface has been developed to simulate the UV aerosol index (AI) from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) aerosol assimilated fields. The purpose of this work is to use the AI and aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measurements as independent validation for the Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Aerosol Reanalysis (MERRAero). MERRAero is based on a version of the GEOS-5 model that is radiatively coupled to the Goddard Chemistry, Aerosol, Radiation, and Transport (GOCART) aerosol module and includes assimilation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Since AI is dependent on aerosol concentration, optical properties and altitude of the aerosol layer, we make use of complementary observations to fully diagnose the model, including AOD from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), aerosol retrievals from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and attenuated backscatter coefficients from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) mission to ascertain potential misplacement of plume height by the model. By sampling dust, biomass burning and pollution events in 2007 we have compared model-produced AI and AAOD with the corresponding OMI products, identifying regions where the model representation of absorbing aerosols was deficient. As a result of this study over the Saharan dust region, we have obtained a new set of dust aerosol optical properties that retains consistency with the MODIS AOD data that were assimilated, while resulting in better agreement with aerosol absorption measurements from OMI. The analysis conducted over the southern African and South American biomass burning regions indicates that revising the spectrally dependent aerosol absorption properties in the near-UV region improves the modeled-observed AI comparisons. Finally, during a period where the Asian region was mainly dominated by anthropogenic aerosols, we have performed a qualitative analysis in which the specification of anthropogenic emissions in GEOS-5 is adjusted to provide insight into discrepancies observed in AI comparisons. © Author(s) 2015.",,No,No,No
Revealing important nocturnal and day-to-day variations in fire smoke emissions through a multiplatform inversion,"We couple airborne, ground-based, and satellite observations; conduct regional simulations; and develop and apply an inversion technique to constrain hourly smoke emissions from the Rim Fire, the third largest observed in California, USA. Emissions constrained with multiplatform data show notable nocturnal enhancements (sometimes over a factor of 20), correlate better with daily burned area data, and are a factor of 2-4 higher than a priori estimates, highlighting the need for improved characterization of diurnal profiles and day-to-day variability when modeling extreme fires. Constraining only with satellite data results in smaller enhancements mainly due to missing retrievals near the emissions source, suggesting that top-down emission estimates for these events could be underestimated and a multiplatform approach is required to resolve them. Predictions driven by emissions constrained with multiplatform data present significant variations in downwind air quality and in aerosol feedback on meteorology, emphasizing the need for improved emissions estimates during exceptional events.

"Columnar-integrated aerosol optical properties and classification of different aerosol types over the semi-arid region, Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh","This study presents a characterization of aerosol columnar properties measured at a semi-arid station Anantapur in the southern part of India during the period from October 2012 to September 2013. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (α) have been retrieved from Microtops II Sunphotometer over the observation site. The results show that a pronounced spectral and monthly variability in the optical properties of aerosols is mainly due to anthropogenic sources. The results show that the spectral curvature can effectively be used as a tool for aerosol type discrimination, since the fine-mode aerosols exhibit negative curvature, while the coarse-mode particles are positive. The classification of aerosols is also proposed by using the values of AOD at 500nm and Angstrom exponent values (α(380-870)) by applying threshold values obtained from the frequency distribution of AOD. The results of the analysis were identified by four individual components (anthropogenic/biomass burning, coarse/dust, coarse/marine, clean continental) of different origin and compositions. The most frequent situations observed over the site are that due to the anthropogenic/biomass burning situations which account for about 45.37%, followed by coarse/dust (43.64%), clean continental (7.2%) and coarse/marine (3.82%) during summer. The identification of the aerosol source type and the modification processes are analyzed by using the Gobbi et al.

Ozone production and transport over the Amazon Basin during the dry-to-wet and wet-to-dry transition seasons,"The Regional Carbon Balance in Amazonia (BARCA) campaign provided the first Amazon Basin-wide aircraft measurements of ozone (O3) during both the dry-to-wet (November and December 2008) and wet-to-dry (May 2009) transition seasons. Extremely low background values (< 20 ppb) were observed to the west and north of Manaus in both seasons and in all regions during the wet-to-dry transition. On the other hand, elevated O3 levels (40-60 ppb) were seen during the dry-to-wet transition to the east and south of Manaus, where biomass burning emissions of O3 precursors were present. Chemistry simulations with the CCATT-BRAMS and WRF-Chem models are within the error bars of the observed O3 profiles in the boundary layer (0-3 km a.s.l.) in polluted conditions. However, the models overestimate O3 in the boundary layer in clean conditions, despite lacking the predominant NO source from soil. In addition, O3 simulated by the models was either within the error bars or lower than BARCA observations in mid-levels (3-5 km a.s.l.), and lower than total tropospheric O3 retrieved from the OMI/MLS instruments, which is primarily comprised of middle troposphere O3 and thus reflects long-range transport processes. Therefore, the models do a relatively poor job of representing the free troposphere-boundary layer gradient in O3 compared with aircraft and satellite observations, which could be due to missing long-range and convective transport of O3 at mid-levels. Additional simulations with WRF-Chem showed that the model O3 production is very sensitive to both the O3 deposition velocities and the NOx emissions, which were both about one-half of observed values. These results indicate the necessity of more realistic model representations of emissions, deposition, and convective processes for accurate monitoring and prediction of increases in O3 production in the Amazon Basin as the regional population grows. © Author(s) 2015.",,No,No,No
Radiocarbon-based source apportionment of elemental carbon aerosols at two South Asian receptor observatories over a full annual cycle,"Black carbon (BC) aerosols impact climate and air quality. Since BC from fossil versus biomass combustion have different optical properties and different abilities to penetrate the lungs, it is important to better understand their relative contributions in strongly affected regions such as South Asia. This study reports the first year-round 14C-based source apportionment of elemental carbon (EC), the mass-based correspondent to BC, using as regional receptor sites the international Maldives Climate Observatory in Hanimaadhoo (MCOH) and the mountaintop observatory of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Sinhagad, India (SINH). For the highly-polluted winter season (December-March), the fractional contribution to EC from biomass burning (fbio) was 53 ±5% (n = 6) at MCOH and 56 ±3% at SINH (n = 5). The fbio for the non-winter remainder was 53 ±11% (n = 6) at MCOH and 48 ±8% (n = 7) at SINH. This observation-based constraint on near-equal contributions from biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion at both sites compare with predictions from eight technology-based emission inventory (EI) models for India of (fbio)EI spanning 55-88%, suggesting that most current EI for Indian BC systematically under predict the relative contribution of fossil fuel combustion. A continued iterative testing of bottom-up EI with top-down observational source constraints has the potential to lead to reduced uncertainties regarding EC sources and emissions to the benefit of both models of climate and air quality as well as guide efficient policies to mitigate emissions. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,No,No,No
Human-ignited wildfire patterns and responses to policy shifts,"Development of efficient forest wildfire policies requires an understanding of the underlying reasons behind forest fire occurrences. Globally, there is a close relationship between forest wildfires and human activities; most wildfires are human events due to negligence (e.g., agricultural burning escapes) and deliberate actions (e.g., vandalism, pyromania, revenge, land use change attempts). We model the risk of wildfire as a function of the spatial pattern of urban development and the abandonment/intensity of agricultural and forestry activities, while controlling for biophysical and climatic factors. We use a count data approach to model deliberately set fires in Galicia, N.W. Spain, where wildfire is a significant threat to forest ecosystems, with nearly 100,000 wildfires recorded during a thirteen-year period (1999-2011). The spatial units of analysis are more than 3600 parishes. Data for the human influences are derived from fine-resolution maps of wildland-urban interface (WUI), housing spatial arrangements, road density, forest ownership, and vegetation type. We found wildfire risk to be higher where there are human populations and development/urbanisation pressure, as well as in unattended forest areas due to both rural exodus and a fragmented forest ownership structure that complicates the profitability of forestry practices. To better help direct management efforts, parameter estimates from our model were used to predict wildfire counts under alternative scenarios that account for variation across space on future land-use conditions. Policies that incentivize cooperative forest management and that constrain urban development in wildlands at hotspot fire locations are shown to reduce wildfire risk. Our results highlight the need for spatially targeted fire management strategies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,No,No,No
Observations and analysis of organic aerosol evolution in some prescribed fire smoke plumes,"Open biomass burning is a significant source of primary air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) and non-methane organic gases (NMOG). However, the physical and chemical atmospheric processing of these emissions during transport is poorly understood. Atmospheric transformations of biomass burning emissions have been investigated in environmental chambers, but there have been limited opportunities to investigate these transformations in the atmosphere. In this study, we deployed a suite of real-time instrumentation on a Twin Otter aircraft to sample smoke from prescribed fires in South Carolina, conducting measurements at both the source and downwind to characterize smoke evolution with atmospheric aging. Organic aerosol (OA) within the smoke plumes was quantified using an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS); refractory black carbon (rBC) was quantified using a single-particle soot photometer, and carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were measured using a cavity ring-down spectrometer. During the two fires for which we were able to obtain aerosol aging data, normalized excess mixing ratios and ""export factors"" of conserved species (rBC, CO, CO2) suggested that changes in emissions at the source did not account for most of the differences observed in samples of increasing age. An investigation of AMS mass fragments indicated that the in-plume fractional contribution (fm/z) to OA of the primary fragment (m/z 60) decreased downwind, while the fractional contribution of the secondary fragment (m/z 44) increased. Increases in f44 are typically interpreted as indicating chemical aging of OA. Likewise, we observed an increase in the O : C elemental ratio downwind, which is usually associated with aerosol aging. However, the rapid mixing of these plumes into the background air suggests that these chemical transformations may be attributable to the different volatilities of the compounds that fragment to these m/z in the AMS. The gas-particle partitioning behavior of the bulk OA observed during the study was consistent with the predictions from a parameterization developed for open biomass burning emissions in the laboratory. Furthermore, we observed no statistically significant increase in total organic mass with atmospheric transport. Hence, our results suggest that dilution-driven evaporation likely dominated over the chemical production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) within our smoke plumes, presumably due to the fast dilution and limited aging times (< ∼ 5 h) that we could sample. © Author(s) 2015.",,No,No,No
Air quality pattern assessment in Malaysia using multivariate techniques; [Penilaian corak kualiti udara di Malaysia menggunakan teknik multivariat],"This study aims to investigate the spatial characteristics in the pattern of air quality monitoring sites, identify the most discriminating parameters contributing to air pollution, and predict the level of air pollution index (API) in Malaysia using multivariate techniques. Five parameters observed for five years (2000-2004) were used. Hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis classified the five air quality monitoring sites into two independent groups based on the characteristics of activities in the monitoring stations. Discriminate analysis for standard, backward stepwise and forward stepwise mode gave a correct assignation of more than 87% in the confusion matrix. This result indicates that only three parameters (PM10, SO2 and NO2) with a p<0.0001 discriminate best in polluting the air. The major possible sources of air pollution were identified using principal component analysis that account for more than 58% and 60% in the total variance. Based on the findings, anthropogenic activities (vehicular emission, industrial activities, construction sites, bush burning) have a strong influence in the source of air pollution. Furthermore, artificial neural network (ANN) was used to predict the level of air pollution index at R2 = 0.8493 and RMSE = 5.9184. This indicates that ANN can predict more than 84% of the API. © 2015, Malaysian Society of Analytical Sciences. All rights reserved.",,No,No,No
Development of PM2.5 source impact spatial fields using a hybrid source apportionment air quality model,"An integral part of air quality management is knowledge of the impact of pollutant sources on ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM). There is also a growing desire to directly use source impact estimates in health studies; however, source impacts cannot be directly measured. Several limitations are inherent in most source apportionment methods motivating the development of a novel hybrid approach that is used to estimate source impacts by combining the capabilities of receptor models (RMs) and chemical transport models (CTMs). The hybrid CTM-RM method calculates adjustment factors to refine the CTM-estimated impact of sources at monitoring sites using pollutant species observations and the results of CTM sensitivity analyses, though it does not directly generate spatial source impact fields. The CTM used here is the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, and the RM approach is based on the chemical mass balance (CMB) model. This work presents a method that utilizes kriging to spatially interpolate source-specific impact adjustment factors to generate revised CTM source impact fields from the CTM-RM method results, and is applied for January 2004 over the continental United States. The kriging step is evaluated using data withholding and by comparing results to data from alternative networks. Data withholding also provides an estimate of method uncertainty. Directly applied (hybrid, HYB) and spatially interpolated (spatial hybrid, SH) hybrid adjustment factors at withheld observation sites had a correlation coefficient of 0.89, a linear regression slope of 0.83 ± 0.02, and an intercept of 0.14 ± 0.02. Refined source contributions reflect current knowledge of PM emissions (e.g., significant differences in biomass burning impact fields). Concentrations of 19 species and total PM2.5 mass were reconstructed for withheld observation sites using HYB and SH adjustment factors. The mean concentrations of total PM2.5 at withheld observation sites were 11.7 (± 8.3), 16.3 (± 11), 8.59 (± 4.7), and 9.2 (± 5.7) μgm-3 for the observations, CTM, HYB, and SH predictions, respectively. Correlations improved for concentrations of major ions, including nitrate (CMAQ-DDM (decoupled direct method): 0.404, SH: 0.449), ammonium (CMAQ-DDM: 0.454, SH: 0.492), and sulfate (CMAQ-DDM: 0.706, SH: 0.730). Errors in simulated concentrations of metals were reduced considerably: 295 % (CMAQ-DDM) to 139 % (SH) for vanadium; and 1340 % (CMAQ-DDM) to 326 % (SH) for manganese. Errors in simulated concentrations of some metals are expected to remain given the uncertainties in source profiles. Species concentrations were reconstructed using SH results, and the error relative to observed concentrations was greatly reduced as compared to CTM-simulated concentrations. Results demonstrate that the hybrid method along with a spatial extension can be used for large-scale, spatially resolved source apportionment studies where observational data are spatially and temporally limited. © Author(s) 2015.",,No,No,No
Global transformation and fate of SOA: Implications of low-volatility SOA and gas-phase fragmentation reactions,"Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are large contributors to fine-particle loadings and radiative forcing but are often represented crudely in global models. We have implemented three new detailed SOA treatments within the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) that allow us to compare the semivolatile versus nonvolatile SOA treatments (based on some of the latest experimental findings) and to investigate the effects of gas-phase fragmentation reactions. The new treatments also track SOA from biomass burning and biofuel, fossil fuel, and biogenic sources. For semivolatile SOA treatments, fragmentation reactions decrease the simulated annual global SOA burden from 7.5 Tg to 1.8 Tg. For the nonvolatile SOA treatment with fragmentation, the burden is 3.1 Tg. Larger differences between nonvolatile and semivolatile SOA (up to a factor of 5) exist in areas of continental outflow over the oceans. According to comparisons with observations from global surface Aerosol Mass Spectrometer measurements and the U.S. Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network measurements, the FragNVSOA treatment, which treats SOA as nonvolatile and includes gas-phase fragmentation reactions, agrees best at rural locations. Urban SOA is underpredicted, but this may be due to the coarse model resolution. All three revised treatments show much better agreement with aircraft measurements of organic aerosols (OA) over the North American Arctic and sub-Arctic in spring and summer, compared to the standard CAM5 formulation. This is mainly due to the oxidation of SOA precursor gases from biomass burning, not included in standard CAM5, and long-range transport of biomass burning OA at high altitudes. The revised model configurations that include fragmentation (both semivolatile and nonvolatile SOA) show much better agreement with MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometers (MODIS) aerosol optical depth data over regions dominated by biomass burning during the summer compared to standard CAM5, and predict biomass burning and biofuel as the largest global source of OA, followed by biogenic and fossil fuel sources. The large contribution of biomass burning OA in the revised treatments is supported by thesemeasurements, but the emissions and aging of SOA precursors and POA are uncertain, and need further investigation. The nonvolatile and semivolatile configurations with fragmentation predict the direct radiative forcing of SOA as -0.5Wm -2 and -0.26Wm -2 respectively, at top of the atmosphere, which are higher than previously estimated by most models, but in reasonable agreement with a recent constrained modeling study. This study highlights the importance of improving process-level representation of SOA in global models. © 2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.",,No,No,No
Ambient polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and pulmonary function in children,"Few studies have examined the relationship between ambient polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pulmonary function in children. Major sources include vehicular emissions, home heating, wildland fires, agricultural burning, and power plants. PAHs are an important component of fine particulate matter that has been linked to respiratory health. This cross-sectional study examines the relationship between estimated individual exposures to the sum of PAHs with 4, 5, or 6 rings (PAH456) and pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity) in asthmatic and non-asthmatic children. We applied land-use regression to estimate individual exposures to ambient PAHs for averaging periods ranging from 1 week to 1 year. We used linear regression to estimate the relationship between exposure to PAH456 with pre- and postbronchodilator pulmonary function tests in children in Fresno, California (N=297). Among non-asthmatics, there was a statistically significant association between PAH456 during the previous 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year and postbronchodilator FEV 1. The magnitude of the association increased with the length of the averaging period ranging from 60 to 110 ml decrease in FEV 1 for each 1 ng/m 3 increase in PAH456. There were no associations with PAH456 observed among asthmatic children. We identified an association between annual PAHs and chronic pulmonary function in children without asthma. Additional studies are needed to further explore the association between exposure to PAHs and pulmonary function, especially with regard to differential effects between asthmatic and non-asthmatic children.",,No,No,No
How thermodynamic environments control stratocumulus microphysics and interactions with aerosols,"Aerosol-cloud interactions are central to climate system changes and depend on meteorological conditions. This study identifies distinct thermodynamic regimes and proposes a conceptual framework for interpreting aerosol effects. In the analysis, ten years (2003-2012) of daily satellite-derived aerosol and cloud products are combined with reanalysis data to identify factors controlling Southeast Atlantic stratocumulus microphysics. Considering the seasonal influence of aerosol input from biomass burning, thermodynamic environments that feature contrasting microphysical cloud properties and aerosol-cloud relations are classified. While aerosol impact is stronger in unstable environments, it is mostly confined to situations with low aerosol loading (aerosol index AI ≲ 0.15), implying a saturation of aerosol effects. Situations with high aerosol loading are associated with weaker, seasonally contrasting aerosol-droplet size relationships, likely caused by thermodynamically induced processes and aerosol swelling. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,No,No,No
